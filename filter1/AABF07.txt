% the national album before a baseball game.

Cyndi Lauper:	[singing] O'er the land, of the free, and the home 
			... [to the tune of "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"] ... 
			home of the bra-ave!  Oh, America, the home of the 
			bra-ave!  The brave, America the brave, the brave!  
			Home of the bra-ave!
			[the crowd cheers wildly]
			Thank you, Springfield!  I love you!  Peace!
Conroy:		Thank you, Cyndi Lauper!  Just to remind you, folks, 
			we do have a baseball game today.
-- Eighties pop AND a baseball game?  What a country, "Wild Barts
   Can't Be Broken"

% Some of the audience members, who had been leaving the stadium, sit 
% back down again, saying, "Oh, right, heh."
%
% Dennis Conroy, the announcer, introduces the Isotopes.  The crowd 
% boos the team, who come out looking out of shape and gasping for 
% breath.

Let's welcome two new additions to the team, Smash Diggins and 
Fishbone Walker.  Lucky for us, they were sent down from the majors 
for drug violations!
-- Dennis Conroy, Springfield Isotopes announcer, "Wild Barts Can't
   Be Broken"

% The two athletes hand urine samples to Lunch Lady Doris, who dips 
% paper in them.  The samples come up dirty, to which the two "toast" 
% with the urine cups.  Tossing them away, the fans cheer.

Homer:	Stupid Isotopes.  Hurry up and lose so we can get outta 
		here!
Lisa:		Why do you hate the Isotopes so much, Dad?
Homer:	Because I loved them once and they broke my heart.  Let 
		that be a lesson to you, sweetie.  Never love anything.
Lisa:		Even you?
Homer:	Especially me.
Bart:		But you gotta support the team, Dad!  They're already 
		threatening to move to Moosejaw.
Marge:	That's right!  Like my mother always said, you've got to 
		stick it out, even if you picked the loser ... [sees Homer 
		picking at his ear and looking at his finger afterward] 
		... to the bitter end.
-- "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% The game begins.

Conroy:	[over PA] First pitch of the game ... [something snaps in 
		the pitcher's arm during the wind-up] that's a rotator 
		cuff, his career's over.
Homer:	[getting up] I'm gonna warm up the car.
Marge:	But there's only been one pitch!
Homer:	And it sucked.
-- "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% Some time later, the game nears its end with bases loaded and two 
% outs.  A rather thin man comes to the plate.  Homer, waiting in his 
% car outside the stadium gates, sings an old childhood favorite.  
% ("Whistle While You Work," with the lyrics reinterpreted as, "Hitler 
% is a jerk, Mussolini ...")
%
% Meanwhile, back at the ball park ...

Conroy:	[over PA] That'll bring up Babe Ruth the fourth.  'Course 
		he's no Babe Ruth the third, but the franchise is very 
		excited about this illegitimate great-grand Bambino!  And, 
		what's this?  He's pointing to the right-field bleachers, 
		probably at a dying little boy.
Bart:		[sees he's being pointed at] Mom, am I dying?
Marge:	No, of course not!
Lisa:		[whispering] Is he, Mom?  You can tell me.
Marge:	No!
Conroy:	[over PA] Now, he's pointing to the ground.  Is he 
		indicating a bunt?  Yes, he's bunting!
		[the visiting fielders, positioning themselves mere feet 
		from home plate, scoop up the called bunt, retiring the 
		side and ending the game]
Marge:	[shouting defeatedly] Good hustle, kid ...
-- "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% Outside in the car, Homer, still singing, collects his family and 
% takes off driving.

Homer:	[singing] ... now it doesn't work.  [normal voice] So who 
		won?  The losers?
Bart:		No, they lost.
Homer:	Heh, heh, heh, heh, losers.
Marge:	But only by two points, and they didn't resort to stealing 
		bases like the other team, so it's kind of a moral 
		victory.
Lisa:		With a little middle relief, they might even make the 
		playoffs!
Homer:	You'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever 
		happens.
Marge:	Homer, would you please stop talking about the childrens' 
		graves?
-- "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% Presumably a few months and a competent middle relief staff into the 
% future, Homer walks into Moe's bar, where a good number of people 
% are yelling wildly.

Homer:	What's the hub-bub?  Did Moe finally blow his brains 
		out?
Lenny:	Quiet!  We're watching the Isotopes.
Homer:	Shut it off, they're losers.
Carl:		Where you been?  The Isotopes are on fire!
Moe:		Yeah, that sniper at the all-star game was a blessing in 
		disguise.
Lenny:	Now we're in the championship game!
Homer:	Championship?  Hmm?
		[Homer ducks out of the bar for a moment, and reappears 
		totally decked out in 'Topes gear]
Homer:	Woo!  'Topes rule! [guzzles a mug of beer]
Brockman:	Well, here's a die-hard fan.  Sir, your beloved Isotopes 
		are  about to make history.  Any thoughts?
Homer:	Uh-huh, it's a great team, Kent.  We never gave up hope 
		... I wanna thank Jesus, and say hi to my special lady 
		Marge.  We did it, baby!  Whoo!  Whooooo!
Brockman:	The inspiring words of a fan who'll always root, root, 
		root for the home team.  Even if they lose this ga ...
Homer:	They lost?!  Those losers!
Brockman:	No, no, no, the game's not over.
Homer:	Whoo!  Not over!  Whoo!
Brockman:	There you have it ... whoo.

% The packed bar cheers at the ballgame on TV.

Bottom of the ninth, two outs.  It all comes down to this.  And here's 
the pitch ... Humpin' Hesus, he got all of that one.  It's going, 
going, going ... [they show a quick shot of a blank-faced man eating a 
hot dog] our technical director today was Stan Kadlubowski ... it's 
out of here!  'Topes win!
-- Conroy announces the shot heard around Springfield, "Wild Barts
   Can't Be Broken"

% The bar patrons go into a frenzy.  While Carl and Lenny toast each 
% other, Homer pours beer on himself and Barney steals a keg and opens 
% it, spraying Kent out the door and then drinking from it.

Moe:		[sighs] Nobody touched my rumaki.
Homer:	[dumping the rumaki dish onto Moe] Whoo!  Ramaki!
-- Almost nobody, "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% In Homer's car, Homer beeps and yells, while Barney sits in the 
% passenger seat, drinking from two bottles at once.  Lenny and Carl 
% sit in the back, drunkenly seeing who can punch the other in the 
% face harder while saying "Isotopes".  They pass Springfield 
% Elementary and its baseball diamond.

Homer:	Hey!  A baseball field!  Batter-up!
		[driving onto the playground, Homer pulls onto the diamond 
		and drives along the basepath]
Lenny:	Oh, baby!  Steal second!
Barney:	I think I'm gonna puke!
Carl:		Hey, who's on first?
Homer:	[approaching home] Touchdown!
Barney:	Slide!
-- "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% The car crashes into the fence behind home and travels through it, 
% when the fence suddenly explodes in flames.  The four then go 
% driving down the school's halls, still yelling drunkenly.  Lenny 
% takes a fire extinguisher off the wall and sprays it on Carl, which 
% quickly fills the vehicle with a white gas.  Unable to see, Homer 
% scrapes a few lockers and shatters the glass on the trophy case.  
% Later, the guys are in the boys' locker room, where they take a 
% shower, singing Queen's "We are the champions," although with the 
% "we are the champions" part before the "you got mud on your face" 
% lyrics.  At this point, Barney slips in the shower and goes down.  
% "Whoop, careful," Homer admonishes.
%
% The next morning, Lisa eats cereal at the table when Homer comes 
% down to leave for work.  "You look really hung over, Dad," she says, 
% "What did you do last night?"
%
% In Homer's mind, a black and white silent film begins entitled 
% "Homer's Night Out".  Walking past Moe's Bar, he puts his finger to 
% his lips and stares up at the sign.  "Hmm ... Perhaps I'll wet my 
% whistle." the caption reads.  Walking in, he buys a drink from Moe 
% (he and the rest of the patrons are dressed, unlike Homer, in early 
% twentieth century clothing), and quaffs it.  A "Scene Missing" frame 
% pops up.  In the next scene, Homer and three maidens are in an 
% idyllic clearing, holding onto ribbons attached to a pole, around 
% which they dance in a circle.  The "Scene Missing' frame pops up 
% again, followed by "The End" and a rather harsh-sounding piano 
% chord.  Back to Homer's unshaven face and bloodshot eyes as he 
% stares, unable to think.

Homer:	Mmm ... uh ... [pats Lisa on the head] Hello, big 
		Maggie!
Bart:		[from living room] Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Someone trashed the 
		school!
Marge:	What the dilly-o?!
		[the Simpsons all watch as Brockman, who obviously 
		didn't stay up long after the game, is in the middle of 
		a report at the scene]
Brockman:	... where the three "R"s stand for rowdiness, 
		ransacking, and ir-responsibility.  Any suspects, Chief?
Wiggum:	None.  That's why we're jumping to the conclusion that 
		this was the work of no-good punk kids.
		Lisa:	Kids?!
Wiggum:	Therefore, effective immediately, I am imposing a 
		curfew.  Any kid caught on the street after dark will be 
		shot.  Or, returned  to their parents, as the situation 
		may warrant.
Bart:		Woah!
Lisa:		Curfew?
Homer:	Serves you little punks right.  Maybe next time you'll 
		think before ... [looks out back window and sees his car 
		there, smashed up and crashed through the Flanders'

% The Simpsons sit around the table, eating.

Bart:		The cops can't just slap a curfew on us.  We have rights!
Marge:	Sure you do.  You have the right to remain silent!
		[Homer and Marge both laugh loudly]
Homer:	That was cold blooded, Marge.
Marge:	Yeah. 
Lisa:		But it's not fair.  Adults always blame kids for 
		everything.
Homer:	Well if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named 
		after them?  Acting childish, kidnapping, child abuse ...
Bart:		What about adultery?
Homer:	Not until you're older, son.

% That night at sunset, the kids of Springfield play outside, until

% the truck off.  "Achtung, babies!" Wiggum yells over his bullhorn.  
% "Curfew is in effect!  Return to your homes immediately!"
% 
% The Flanders kids scream and run indoors, and the rest of the 
% children slowly and reluctantly walk back to their homes.

Wiggum:	All right, let's see some ID's, boys. [takes their IDs] 
		All right, you two scofflaws are violating curfew.  I'm

-- "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% Homer runs back outside, laughing mirthfully.  Bart and Lisa sigh

% At the Simpson house, Lisa and Bart languidly lie in the living

% Bart, holding a bowling ball over his head, is about to smash the

% since there's a commercial on.
%
% As if this weren't a reason to smash the set even more, the two

% To get inside, the curfew-breaking kids have to pass by a fence.

Frink:	I have captured the signal and am presently triangulating 
		the vectors and compressing the data down in order to 
		express it as a function of my hand. [points] They're over 
		there!
-- "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% Behind the billboard of Wiggum drinking coffee, Nelson and Milhouse 
% move a cable up and down, while Lisa speaks into Skinner's old 
% microphone.  Bart controls the signalboard, while Martin stands by.

Lisa:		And guess who's been practicing medicine without a 
		license?
		[at the town meeting, Dr. Hibbert begins to sweat and look 
		anxiously about.  Back behind the sign, Lisa finishes her 
		revelation]
Lisa:		That's right!  Homer Simpson!
Homer:	[off in distance] D'oh!
-- "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% Back behind the sign, Wiggum shines a light on the kids and aims his 
% gun at them.

Wiggum:	Freeze, you little shock-jocks!
		[as the adults at the town meeting come to the scene, 
		and a few kids to boot, Professor Frink inspects the 
		kids' work]
Frink:	Brilliant!  They transduced amplitude modulation via the 
		concavity of that oversized beverage conveyance!  I 
		mean, that is some clever goyvin!
		[Wiggum talks to the kids, still on the ledge behind the 
		billboard, through a bullhorn]
Wiggum:	All right, kids, you can come down now.  We promise we 
		won't kill you.
Homer:	Bart, get down here!  I'm gonna spank you back to the 
		stone age!
Bart:		You can't make us come down.
Nelson:	You adults are always giving us orders.
Skinner:	Oh, you kids are always disobeying them.
Milhouse:	Adults treat kids like children!
Kirk:		Kids treat adults like cash machines!
Kids:		Adults!
Adults:	Kids!
Kids:		Adults!
Adults:	Kids!
Kids:		Adults!

Lovejoy:	[to the tune of "Kids"] Kids!  You've had your fun, 
		now we've had our fill.
Homer:	Yeah!  You're only here 'cause Marge forgot her pill.
		[Marge looks away and grumbles in embarrassment]
Wiggum:	Kids, you're all just scandalizing, vandalizing 
		punks.
Krusty:	Channel-hopping, Ritalin-popping monkeys! [aside to 
		Allison] Please don't quit the fan-club!
Marge:	Kids!  I can nag and nag 'til my hair turns blue!
Edna:		Kids!  You bum my smokes and don't say 'thank you'!
Rod & Todd:	Why can't you be like we are?
		[the Flanders kids get pelted with tomatoes.
Adults:	Oh, what a bunch of brats!
Moe:		We oughta drown you just like cats!
		[Moe holds up a sack, from which Snowball II jumps 
		out]
Bart:		Adults!  You run our lives like you're Colonel Klink!
Nelson:	Adults!  You strut around like your farts don't 
		stink!
Lisa:		Adults!  You're such a drooling, boring, boozing 
		boring bunch.  Surly, meany, three-martini lunchers 
		...
Ralph:	I just ate a thumbtack!
Milhouse:	Adults!  They're always telling us to ...
		[Jasper, Abe, and a group of elderly folks walk up to 
		the scene.  Abe lassoes Milhouse around the neck with 
		his cane]
Abe:		... shut your traps!
Jasper:	Eh ... we're fed up with all you whipper-snaps!
Elderlies:	We're tryin' to get some sleep here, it's almost six-
		fifteen!
		What's the matter with ...
Adults:	Don't you treat us like ...
Kids:		Can't you just lay off ...
Elderlies:	We're sick of all of you!
All:		Kids ... to ... day!
-- The "Kids" song, "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% The song ends with the three groups facing off against each other, 
% until the kids rejoin their parents against the elderly.

Abe:		We're gonna teach all of you rug-rats a lesson.
Homer:	Oh, yeah?  Pfft.  What can you old people do to us?
Krusty:	Yeah, you old fogies.
Moe:		Buzz off, you old buzzards.
Ralph:	Someone should iron you.
-- "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% Sometime later, the Simpson family watches TV in their living rooms 
% at night.

Brockman:	This is Kent Brockman reporting from ... my own home, in 
		accordance with the new curfew for anyone under seventy.
Marge:	Mmm ... I can't believe that passed.
Lisa:		I warned you guys that seniors always vote in record 
		numbers!
Brockman:	The controversial measure passed by a single vote.
Marge:	Oh, you really should have voted, Homer.
Homer:	Pfft, it wouldn't have made a difference.
Abe:		[from window, with flashlight] Lights out, you punk 
		kids!
-- "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken"

% Abe walks back out onto Evergreen Terrace, where a group of his 
% fellow elderly people enjoy themselves.  A couple of them kick a can 
% about, which offends the Crazy Old Man, causing him to complain all 
% the way through the credits.

Crazy Old Man:		Hey fellas!  Hey, you wanna stop with the 
				kicking?  My pills are in that can!  Good 
				gravy, I don't kick your things ... when you're 
				trying to breathe on the machine, do I go up 
				and kick it?  Uh, now look at that, it went 
				down the sewer, you happy?  I'm gonna sue now!  
				Now it's time for the lawyers!
Gracie Films Lady:	Shh!
Crazy Old Man:		Oh, don't tell me to shush!  You stupid lady!
