% The Simpsons finally arrive at the ghost town called "Bloodbath

Marge:	This should be very educational.  I want you kids to pay 
	attention.
Guide:	Founded by prostitutes in 1849, and serviced by prostitute 
	express riders who could bring in a fresh prostitute from 
	Saint Joe in three days; Bloodbath Gulch quickly became 
	known as a place where a trail hand could spend a month's 
	pay in three minutes.
Homer:	Three minutes!  [whistles]
Marge:	I never realized history was so filthy!
Guide:	First on our tour is the whore house; then we'll visit the 
	cathouse, the brothel, the bordello, and finally the old 
	mission.
Marge:	Oh, thank heaven!
Guide:	Lots of prostitutes in there!
Marge:	Hmmmmm ...
-- History class was never like this, "Homer Simpson in:  Kidney

Guide:	... but there was more to the old west than just sex,

	see a real old west hitchin' post, possibly used by 
	bandits, possibly during some exciting adventure!  And 
	these planks below us were possibly used as a sidewalk by 
	people who may or may not have been bandits!
Marge:	[takes a photo of the planks] That's a keeper!  [Homer 
	raises his hand]
Guide:	Uh, yes sir?
Homer:	Do we have to listen to you?
Guide:	Well, no, you don't, but if you have any interest in 
	history ...
Homer:	I'm done!  [walks away]  [Marge nervously laughs, picks up

Curly:	[walks to Homer] Help me, please!  I'm sick!

Moe:	No, no, no, no, making polenta, now that's a procedure.  
	We're talking about deadly life threatening surgery here.
Homer:	Really?  You think It's dangerous?
Carl:	Oh, yeah; and even if you survive the operation ...
Homer:	Procedure!  Deadly procedure.
Carl:	Whatever, the point is, with only one kidney, you won't be 
	able to drink yourself stupid no more.
Homer:	[defensively] Now you're just trying to scare me.

Homer:	Marge, I've been thinking.  What if instead of donating

	artificial kidney I invented?
Marge:	Oh, Homer, that was just a beer can with a whistle glued

Homer:	Oh, but I don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body!

Marge:	Oh, anything, sweetheart!
