% Marge reads a romance novel tearfully in bed one night while Homer
% sleeps next to her.

Marge: [sniffling] This romance is so full of heartfelt passion.  I can
       really identify with this corn-fed heroine.
        [turns to Homer] Homer...Homer, you awake?  This is important --
       give me some sign you're awake...
Homer: [belches]
Marge: [annoyed] Wake up!
Homer: [slurred] Wha?  What's wrong?  House run away?  Dog's on fire?
Marge: Homey, do you think the romance has gone out of our lives?
Homer: [belches]
-- A definitive answer, "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

Marge: [annoyed] Wake up!
Homer: Marge, it's 3:00am and I worked all day!
Marge: It's 9:30pm and you spend your whole Saturday drinking beer in
       Maggie's kiddie pool!
        [clip from 9F06: Homer pulling hotdog from kiddie pool]
       Homer, young people learn about love from adults and we've been
       setting a terrible example for our children and the community in
       general.  I want us to deal with the issues raised by this book.
Homer: [takes it] Hmm...
        [clip from 8F17: book lands on fire]
Marge: Hmm...I knew we shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
-- It's good for snuggling, however, "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

% The next day the children are watching a clip from Itchy and Scratchy
% in 9F01, "Flay Me to the Moon", and laughing uproariously.

       [kids laughs at Itchy and Scratchy]
Marge: How many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
 Bart: It's a _new_ episode.
 Lisa: Not exactly...they pieced it together from old shows, but it
       seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth.
 Bart: Really?
 Lisa: Ren and Stimpy do it all the time.
Marge: Yes they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk
       about Ren and Stimpy?
-- Not since the cartoon awards in 9F16, "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

% The family sit around the kitchen table.

Marge: Children, your father and I have fed and clothed you but we've
       neglected something more important: it's time to learn about
       love.
 Bart: No need, Mom.  We already learned in school.
        [0:38 clip from 8F22: Fuzzy and Fluffy Bunny]
Marge: I mean "romance", not "love".
 Lisa: Mom, romance is dead.  It was acquired in a hostile takeover by
       Hallmark and Disney, homogenized, and sold off piece by piece.
-- No cynicism here, "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

% Marge disagrees, claiming romance is all around them, citing examples
% from 9F13 (Ned serenading Maude) and 9F05 (Smithers dreaming of Burns
% flying through the window).

Marge: All you have to do [to remember romance] is think about your most
       cherished memories.
 Bart: Hmm...
        [flashback to 7G01]
  Moe: [on the phone] Moe's Tavern.
 Bart: Hello, is Al there?
  Moe: Al?
 Bart: Yeah, Al.  Last name, Coholic.
  Moe: Lemme check.  [turns] Phone call for Al...Al Coholic?
  Moe: Er, Jacques Strap?  [7G06]
  Moe: Is I. P. Freely here?  [7G03]
  Moe: Hey, is there a Butz here?  Seymour Butz?  [7F11]
  Moe: Uh...Homer Sexual?  [7F15]
  Moe: Mike Rotch?  [7F22]
  Moe: Er, Amanda Huggenkiss?  [9F06]
  Moe: Uh, Hugh Jass?  [8F08]
  Moe: Ivana Tinkle?  [9F06]
  Moe: I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt and my butt
       smells and...I like to kiss my own butt.  [8F02]
-- Yeah, _true_ romance, "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

% "No, no, no," emphasizes Marge.

Marge: Ask your heart what its fondest desire is.
Homer: Hmm...
        [flashback]
Homer: Mmm...chocolate.  [9F17]
Homer: Mmm...invisible cola.  [1F03]
Homer: Mmm...forbidden donut.  [1F04]
Homer: {Mmm...sacrilicious.  [1F14]}
Homer: {Mmm...snouts.  [8F17]}
Homer: {Mmm...free goo.  [1F06]}
Homer: {Mmm...something.}
-- Don't get too specific, now, "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

% But Marge still isn't getting through.

Marge: No, think about people.  Think about moments in your life that
       have been very romantic.
Homer: Oh, OK.
        [clip from 1F14: Homer kissing Flanders at football game]
Marge: That's not the idea at all...
-- "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

% Marge gives in and decides to tell the family about her almost-affair
% with Jacques.  A 3:06 clip from 7G11 runs which Marge narrates over.

Marge: I made the right decision to stay with my Homey, so there was no
       harm done.
Homer: [groans]
Marge: So if you kind of mentally snip out the part where I already had
       a husband, that's my idea of romance.
Homer: Marge, I want you to stop seeing the Jacques.  You can let him
       down gently, but over the next couple of months I want you to
       break it off.
Marge: Er, OK, Homer...
Homer: Whew!  That was a close one, kids.
-- Marge, reasonable acquiescer, "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 8:07]

% Homer decides he has a confession to make as well.

Homer: OK, Marge: as long as we're traumatizing the kids, _I_ have a
       scandalous story of my own.
        [3:27 {2:57 in syndication} clip from 1F07: Homer and Mindy]
 Bart: What happened to Mindy?
Marge: [angry] Yes, what _did_ happen to her?
Homer: Ehh, she hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
Marge: Hmph.  Good.
-- Not exactly a gracious reaction, "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

Marge: Does anyone else have a love story?
 Lisa: Yes, I do.  And just like your love stories, it's tragic and
       filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal.
        [2:31 clip from 9F13: Lisa and Ralph]
Marge: Lisa, not all romances turn out that way.  Bart, do you have a
       love story that doesn't end in heartbreak?
 Bart: Yes, I do.
        [0:28 clip from 9F06: Bart and Laura]
       Wait...that _did_ end in heartbreak.  Thanks for opening up old
       wounds, _Mom_.
Marge: Hmm.
-- "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 15:28]

Marge: [bright] Well, as Jerry Lee Lewis would say, "There's a whole
       lotta frownin' going on".  [laughs, then says "Mmm..."]
 Lisa: Mom, doesn't _any_ love story have a happy ending?
Marge: Of course!  Remember when...uh...your aunt Selma got married?
        [0:04 flashback to 8F20: Sideshow Bob rubbing Selma's feet]
Selma: Ooh, oh, good, mm.
  Bob: [quietly] Soon I will kill you --
Marge: [in the present] Oh wait, wait, that's no good.  I know...your
       _grandfather_?, remember?
        [2:15 clip from 1F20: Grampa and Mrs. Bouvier]
 Lisa: That doesn't seem like a happy ending.  That seems more like a
       detached tale of modern alienation.
Marge: I give up.  Did anybody learn anything about love tonight?
 Bart: We learned it screws everybody up.
Marge: Well, there's that side of it, but there's also -- oh, help me
       out here, Lisa.
 Lisa: Sorry, Mom.  I've decided to save my love for someone who's
       guaranteed not to reject me.  [pulls out "Non-Threatening Boys"]
       Soon, Corey, soon.
-- Here are some words that rhyme with Corey: ..., "Another Simpsons
    Clip Show"

% Marge sighs.

Marge: Well kids, I tried, but maybe you're right.
Homer: Wait a minute, Marge.  Love isn't hopeless.  Maybe I'm no expert
       on the subject, but there was one time I got it right.
        [1:32 clip from 7F12: Marge and Artie, then Marge and Homer]
 Lisa: Aw, your first kiss...
Homer: But not the last.
        [seven clips of Marge and Homer kissing, from 7G10, 7F10, 7F02,
       8F10, 8F10, 8F18, 1F08]
Marge: Oh, Homey...
        [they kiss again]
       You see, kids?  That's what I mean by romance.
        [kids laugh in the other room at Itchy and Scratchy]
-- I guess they prefer violence, "Another Simpsons Clip Show"

% Homey and Marge kiss anyway, ignoring their violence-obsessed
% children.
