% Marge chauffeurs Lisa and Bart en route to the Springfield Comics
% convention...

Lisa:  If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will
       be gone!
Bart:  Ah, what do you care about good comics?  All you every buy is Casper
       the Wimpy Ghost.
Lisa:  I think it's sad that you equate friendliness with wimpiness, and
       I hope it'll keep you from ever achieving true popularity.
Bart:  Well, you know what I think?  I think Casper is the ghost of
       Richie Rich. [shows comics of Casper and Richie Rich]
Lisa:  Hey, they do look alike!
Bart:  Wonder how Richie died.
Lisa:  Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money really is and
       took his own life.
Marge: Kids, could you lighten up a little?

Bart: Oooh, what's that?
Otto: My very own idea for a comic book, little man.
      [unveils his conception of Busman, which bears a distinct resemblance
