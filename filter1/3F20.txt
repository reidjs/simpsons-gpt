%
% A helicopter observes the bear.

This is Kent Brockman with a special report from the Channel 6 News
Copter.  A large, bear-like animal, most likely a bear, has wandered
down from the hill in search of food or perhaps employment.
-- Perhaps on `Gentle Ben', "Much Apu About Nothing"

% This reporter urges families to stay indoors.
%
% Homer laughs and pities the poor `Impson Family' (whose mailbox is

% out the window worriedly.

Homer: Let's all calm down.  Everyone's going to be just fine, as long

        [opens the refrigerator only to find boxes of baking soda]
       [screams] All right, that does it.  If I'm going to be trapped
       in the house, I gotta go out and get some beer.
-- Bear problems in Springfield, "Much Apu About Nothing"

% Homer's hare brained scheme ends up in a pantless face to face

Book 'em Lou.  One count of being a bear.  And one count of being an
accessory to being a bear.
-- Chief Wiggum arrests a bear and Barney, "Much Apu About Nothing"

Marge: Well, things were bad everywhere.
Homer: I'm sick of these constant bear attacks.  It's like a frickin'

-- Or jamboree even, "Much Apu About Nothing"

% Ned reminds Homer that this is the only bear this town has seen, but
% Homer gets the whole town with him with a catchy chant...

Homer: We're here, we're queer, we don't want anymore bears.
Crowd: We're here, we're queer, we don't want anymore bears.
Lenny: Hey, that's a pretty catchy chant.  Where did you hear it?
Homer: Oh, I heard it at the mustache parade they have every year.
-- "Much Apu About Nothing"

% The crowd busts through City Hall and bangs on the mayor's door.

Assistant: Sir, there's an unruly mob here to see you.
   Quimby: Does it have an appointment?
Assistant: [consults clipboard] Yes, it does.
  Skinner: I phoned ahead!
-- Never can be too prepared, "Much Apu About Nothing"

 Homer: Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you, but this town is infested
        by bears.
   Moe: Yeah, and these ones are smarter than the average bear.  They
        swiped my pic-a-nic basket.
 Helen: [frantic] Think of the children!
Quimby: All right, I promise to take swift and decisive action against

 Lisa: That's spacious reasoning, Dad.
Homer: Thank you, dear.
 Lisa: By your logic I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away.
Homer: Oh, how does it work?
 Lisa: It doesn't work.
Homer: Uh-huh.

Homer: Uh-huh.
 Lisa: But I don't see any tigers around, do you?

% The mail arrives.

Homer: Woo-hoo!  A perfect day.  Zero bears and one big fat hairy
       paycheck.
        [opens it up]
       Hey!  How come my pay is so low? ... Bear patrol tax!  This is
       an outrage!  It's the biggest tax increase in history!
 Lisa: Actually, Dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history.
Homer: Let the bears pay the bear tax.  I pay the Homer tax.
 Lisa: That's home-_owner_ tax.
Homer: Well, anyway, I'm still outraged.
-- And with good cause, "Much Apu About Nothing"

% The mob is back, yelling "Down with taxes!  Down with taxes!"

   Quimby: Are those morons getting dumber or just louder?
Assistant: [checks his clipboard] Dumber, sir.
-- Dumb and dumber, "Much Apu About Nothing"

% "They want the bear patrol but they won't pay taxes for it."  Quimby
% thinks of a novel solution.  He announces that taxes are high because

% At home, Lisa attempts to talk things out with Homer.

 Lisa: I don't see how you can support Proposition 24, Dad.
Homer: Open your eyes, Lisa!  Our schools are so jam-packed with

 Bart: There's no denying it, Sis.
-- More spacious reasoning, "Much Apu About Nothing"

% Lisa reminds the family that the Simpson family immigrated here,
% and Abe gives in.

      Abe: [narrating] The story of the Simpson family began in the Old
           Country.  I forget which one exactly.  My dad would drone
           on and on about America.  He thought it was the greatest
           thing since sliced bread, sliced bread having been invented
           the previous winter.
Abe's dad: [holds up an America pamphlet]  See that, son?  That's where
           we're going to live.  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
           but someday.
      Abe: Later that day, we set sail for America.
Abe's dad: [points at the Statue of Liberty] See that, son?  That's our

Young Abe: [playing on Statue's arm] Yay!  I love America!
Abe's mom: Abe!  Supper's on!

        [Frink stands in front of a huge mainframe]
Frink: Well, sure, the Frinkiac-7 looks impressive [to student] Don't
       touch it! [back to class] But I predict that within 100 years
       computers will be twice as powerful, 10,000 times larger, and
       so expensive that only the five richest kings in Europe will
       own them.
  Apu: Could it be used for dating?
