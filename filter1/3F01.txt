         tested positive for Crack and PCP.
  Marge: Oh my!
          ["Fifteen minutes later"]
Goodman: OK, the retest says you're clean.  Sorry about the mistake.
  Marge: The only thing I'm high on is love...love for my son and
         daughters.  Yes, a little LSD is all I need.
Goodman: All right, sounds very good.

% Ned still can't get over the fact that Bart and Lisa aren't baptized.

    Ned: Jeepers H. Crackers.  I'd better call the Reverend.
          [pushes "Rev. Lovejoy" button on phone]
          [the Rev is playing with a train set]
 Mrs. L: Heh heh, Ned Flanders is on the phone.
Lovejoy: [groans] Mmm...hello, Ned.
    Ned: [breathless] Reverend...emergency!  I -- it's the Simpson kids
         -- eedily -- I, uh, baptism -- oodily -- uh -- doodily doodily!
Lovejoy: Ned...have you thought about one of the other major religions?
         They're all pretty much the same.  [hangs up]
          [his train crashes]
         Oh.  Damn Flanders!
    Ned: Looks like I'm going to have to baptise you myself.
          [breaks open the Emergency Baptism kit]

% barricades while the parents go next door to get their kids.

Homer: Kids!  We're good parents now.  Get your asses out here!
Marge: We've missed you so much.
        [they gasp at the "Gone Baptizin'" sign on Flanders' door]
       He's going to baptize _our_ children?
Homer: Oh, no!  In the eyes of God they'll be Flanderseseses.
-- Homer confuses possessives, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

% On the way to the baptism site, Ned reflects on recent events.

   Ned: Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents,
        but now I know you kids need a less hellbound family!
 Maude: Just sit back, and before you know it, you'll be part of the
        Flanders flock.
  Bart: Ha ha, you're going to be Lisa Flanders!
  Lisa: You're going to be _Bart_ Flanders.
  Bart: Aah!
 Maude: Oh, relax, Bart.  Your sister Maggie isn't scared.
  Bart: That's because she can't talk.
Maggie: [pulls her pacifier out] Daddily doodily!
         [she turns her head 180 degrees to face Bart and Lisa]

% Homer and Marge are in hot pursuit.

Marge: Where are we going?  Where are we going?
Homer: OK, OK, don't panic.  To find Flanders, I just have to think like
       Flanders!
        [thinking] I'm a big four-eyed lame-o, and I wear the same
       stupid sweater every day and --
        [aloud] The Springfield River!
-- "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

% At said river, the Flanders family sings the final couple of lines of
% "Amazing Grace".  Ned is dressed in priestly garb.

Ned: Today we write a new page in the Flanders Family Bible!
      [he leads the kids into the water]

% Rev. Lovejoy has a couple of movers helping him move his train track.
% As they reach the middle of the road, Homer's car slams through the
% board on which the tracks are mounted, destroying it.  Lovejoy
% implores heavenward, "Why do you hate my trains?"
%
% At the river, Ned prepares to anoint Bart with water from a golden
% chalice.  Homer and Marge arrive, Homer spots the "I (heart) your
% children" bumper sticker on Flanders' car, and he growls and runs down
% the hill to the river.  On the way, he trips, and bounces down the
% rest of the way, coming to rest with his face in the mud on the bank.
% He looks up just in time to see Ned tipping the chalice.  "No!" he
% cries in slow-motion, diving toward Bart to knock him out of the way.
% He reaches Bart just in time -- but the baptism water lands on Homer's
% head instead.  He writhes around in the river and growls, finally
% coming to rest face down.
%
% Bart and Lisa run up to him and hug him.

 Bart: Wow, Dad, you took a baptismal for me.  How do you feel?
Homer: [reverently] Oh, Bartholomew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo
       after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan.
  Ned: [gasps] Wait!  Homer, what did you just say?
Homer: I said shut your ugly face, Flanders!
  Ned: Oh, fair enough.
-- Ned, forgiving Christian, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

% Homer looks toward the bank and sighs, "Oh, there's my sweet little
% Maggie."  She looks to his outstretched arms, then over at the
% Flanders family, who stand clean and dry on the bank with a butterfly
% flying and rabbit hopping around them.  In the water, meanwhile,
% Homer, Bart, and Lisa look sodden, and a frog jumps out of the water.
% Maggie starts to walk toward the Flanders, but just then, Marge walks
% around the corner.  Maggie reaches for her mother, and Marge scoops
% her up and spins around with her in the sunlight.  "Oh, Maggie, you're
% a Simpson again."  As if in agreement, she pulls out her pacifier and
% burps.
%
% The Simpson family, reunited at last, hug and walk away.

Marge: So what was it like at the Flanders' house?
Homer: Yeah, gimme all the dirt.
 Lisa: Let's see.  Dirt....dirt...well, there wasn't really much dirt.
 Bart: There was a bunch of old paint cans in the garage, though.
Homer: [laughs scoffingly] Old painty-can Ned.
        [the family laugh too]
