% It's nighttime, and the city of Springfield sleeps.  Comic Book Guy
% cuddles up with his beloved Jar-Jar doll.  But not everyone is in
% slumberland.  Homer's buzz-saw snoring is keeping Marge awake. 
% Marge tries desperately to block the sound, even tying her hair
% around her ears, but nothing works.  Even blocking Homer's mouth and
% nose fails, since that just redirects the snoring through his
% eyelids.  The next morning, Marge is clearly out-of-sorts, groggily
% dumping some milk on a potted flower instead of a cereal bowl, and
% handing the "breakfast" to Bart.  Lisa gets a stack of magazines
% with syrup.

Cool -- Mom's on drugs!  If we turn her in, we can get a form letter 
from Dick Cheney.
-- Bart Simpson, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Lisa correctly guesses that sleep deprivation is causing Marge's
% problems.  Marge makes a Wednesday afternoon appointment for her
% husband with Dr. Hibbert, allowing the doctor to get in a round of
% "mailbox golf" that morning.

Marge:		I haven't lost so much sleep since little Barty had 
		the scoots.
Hibbert:	Well, there's a surgical option, but it's not cheap.  
		[writes something on a slip of paper, and slides it 
		across his desk to Homer] Here's what it costs.
Homer:		[reads paper] Interesting.  Here's my counter-offer.  
		[writes something on the paper and gives it back to 
		Hibbert]
Hibbert:	[reads.  The note says, "Do it for free"]
		[chuckles, then turns very serious] Get out.
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% So Homer keeps on snoring.  Marge crawls out onto the front stoop
% for some shut-eye, only to be awakened when the morning paper is
% thrown there.  ("Sleep important, study says," is the day's
% headline.)
%
% The lack of sleep is definitely taking its toll on Marge.  One
% morning, she's driving Bart, Lisa, and Milhouse somewhere when she
% nods off.  Her head hits the steering wheel, sounding the horn.  The
% sound wakes her up.  "I'll get it," she yells, right before
% "answering" the driver's-side door.  Marge is thrown from the car,
% and rolls down a hillside, which turns out to be surprisingly
% restful.
%
% The kids, meanwhile, have to take over the driverless car.  Bart
% takes the wheel, while Milhouse and Lisa have pedal duty.

Milhouse:	So Lisa, do you have a date for the harvest dance?
Lisa:		This is not a good time.
Milhouse:	It's never a good time!
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% That night Marge, looking bedraggled, turns up at her sisters'
% apartment.

Patty:	[gasps] Overnight bag, no husband in sight -- it's 
	happened!
Selma:	She left Homer?  I'll get the champale.
Patty:	And let's get that ring off!  [takes out a large pair of 
	bolt-cutters]
Marge:	Whoa, whoa, whoa, Delilah!  I didn't leave Homer, and I 
	never will.  I just need one night away from his snoring.
Selma:	Great -- we'll have a girls' night.
Patty:	No bras!  [uses the bolt-cutter to snip her bra strap.  
	Liberated, her bosom drops about four inches]
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% A couple of champales later, the ladies decide to watch some TV.

Selma:	Let's catch the tail end of "Nookie in New York."
Marge:	"Nookie in New York?"
Patty:	It's a cable show about four single women who act like gay 
	men.
Marge:	That sounds great!
-- Fabulous, even, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% They turn on the show.  Four women sit around a table in a
% restaurant.

[These names are probably way off; I'm not a "SatC" watcher.]
Miranda:	If I'm not having sex by the end of this goat-cheese 
		quesadilla, I'm going to scream.
Charlotte:	I also enjoy sex.
Samantha:	Since this morning, I've had sex with a New York 
		Knick, two subway cops, and a guy who works on Wall 
		Street.
Charlotte:	Broker?
Sarah:		Nah.  She's just really sore.  [they all laugh]
		[back in the Bouviers' apartment]
Patty:		This is so like our lives.
Selma:		[grunts approval] It's like they hid a camera in our 
		apartment.
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% "Coming up next on BHO," an announcer says, "It's 'Arli$$'!"  This
% sends Patty and Selma diving for the remote.  They tune in to the
% Channel 6 News.

Kent:	Gentlemen, start your envy.  "Mens' Wealth" magazine has 
	listed the 100 richest men in the country, and coming in 
	at number five is Springfield native Artie Ziff.
Patty:	[to Marge] Whoa!  Your old boyfriend.
Marge:	Please -- we went out once.
Kent:	Artie made megabucks with a revolutionary invention -- a 
	converter that changes that horrible modem noise into 
	easy-listening music.
	[some footage of Artie demonstrating his invention is 
	shown.  He's in a computer store, and a modem is 
	connecting somewhere.  As it makes the usual electric 
	squealing noise, Artie flips a switch, and it begins to 
	play "Georgie Girl"]
	Also available with lyrics!  [flips a switch]
Modem:	[singing, in Artie's voice, to the tune of "Georgie Girl"]
	Hey, com-puter geek,
	You will be connected in no time.
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Marge's sisters wonder why she didn't reel Artie in when she had the
% chance.  Marge tells them the story of how Artie went from a "sweet
% little shrimp" to an "octopus," as we here in TV land see flashback
% from "The Way We Was (7F12)."

Selma:	Well, I think you should get in touch with him.  You know, 
	just to congratulate him on his success.
	[nudges Marge's champale glass towards Patty, who refills 
	it]
Marge:	Well, I suppose I could just write him a letter.
Patty:	Are you nuts?  [points to a computer] E-mail, female.
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% So Thoroughly Modern Marge and her sisters get ready to send Artie
% an e-mail.  Marge drinks champale and tries to think of what to say. 
% Patty sits at the computer and helps her along.

Selma:	You just tell us what you want to say.
Marge:	Okay, hold on to your hats.  [takes a sip of her drink] 
	Dear Artie ... [giggles]
Patty:	[types] Dear Hottie ...
Marge:	Congratulations on your recent TV appearance.
Patty:	I want to sex you up.  Your love slave, Marge.
Marge:	[gasps] You can't use the word "sex" on the internet.
Patty:	Watch me.  [presses a button, and sends the message on its 
	way]
-- What's next, dirty pictures on the internet?  "Half-Decent
   Proposal"

% Forbidden words or not, the message zips over to Artie's Silicon
% Valley office (pausing for a moment at a Cisco router).  Artie sorts
% through the day's mail.

Artie:	[bored] Anti-trust suit, anti-trust suit ... [yawns]
	[perks up] A note from Marge Simpson?  Well, isn't that a 
coincidence.  I was just thinking about her ...
	[the camera pulls back to reveal an office decorated 
exclusively with pictures and statues of Marge]
	... for the last *twenty years!*
-- You were always on my mind, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 5:48]
%
% The next morning Marge is feeling rejuvenated, and the family
% immediately notices the difference as she makes breakfast -- no 
% magazines or flowers this time.  Homer toasts the "happy, well-
% rested" Marge.  Suddenly, a helicopter lands in the back yard.

Lisa:	Hey, a helicopter's landing on our lawn.
Bart:	Let's approach with caution!
	[the family, save for Homer, goes out to meet the chopper]
Homer:	[laughs] Unguarded breakfast -- the sweetest taboo.
	[begins eating]
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% The helicopter lands, and Artie disembarks.

Artie:	Well, well, Marge Bouvier.
Marge:	Artie Ziff?  Oh, oh, that e-mail.  Look, I got a little 
	drunk, and we--
Artie:	I'm not surprised you want me back in your life.  You 
	can't spell "party" without "Artie" -- if you misspell 
	"party" ... or "Artie" ...
	How you doing?
Marge:	Look, it's great to see you, but you should know I'm 
	happily married.
Artie:	Married?  Was it consummated?
Marge:	Pretty much, yeah.  [gestures to the kids.  Lisa waves]
-- That settles that question, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Homer walks up, carrying a bowl of cereal.  Marge chastises him for
% eating with his mouth full, and Artie sees an opening.  He invites
% the family for a sail on his ship, the Paziffic Prince.
%
% Homer, Marge, and Artie enjoy a few drinks on the deck.

Artie:	Homer, Marge, I have a rather delicate proposition.
Homer:	Spill it, moneybags.
Artie:	[chuckles] Yes, I do have everything.  Yet I often wonder 
	what life with Marge would have been like.
Homer:	It's like being married to my best friend -- and he lets 
	me feel his boobs.
Marge:	[laughs] Homey!
Artie:	Homer, I will give you one million dollars to let me spend 
	the weekend alone -- with your wife.
Marge:	[gasps]
Homer:	Hmm, a million dollars?  Wait a minute, how much sex would 
	be involved?  [threatens Artie with his fist] 'Cause if 
	it's some ...
Artie:	No, no, no, all I want is to show her what life would have 
	been like had she chosen me.
Marge:	Artie, that's a sick idea.  C'mon, Homer, we're leaving.
	[Homer and Marge get up and leave]
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Artie's helicopter takes off from Ziff's ship, carrying Marge out of
% his life once again.

Artie:	[yelling after the helicopter] Just think about it!
Cap'n:	You'll win her yet, Artie.  I mean, eh, Ahhrrr-tie.  [they 
	walk off]
	[Lisa and Bart emerge from below deck]
Lisa:	Hey, where's our parents?
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% That night, Homer wakes up with an idea.

Homer:	Hey, Marge, I just thought of something.
Marge:	What?
Homer:	If we had Artie's money, I could get that snoring surgery.  
	Plus at least two of those other surgeries I desperately 
	need.  [grabs his chest and grimaces in evident pain]
Marge:	No way, no how.  I got used to the snoring, just like I 
	got used to saying Courtney Cox-Arquette.  Besides, I like 
	some of the noises you make in bed.
Homer:	Well, one squeaking spring symphony coming up.
	[a discreet amount of time later]
Marge:	Wow, Homer, that was amazing.
Homer:	Yeah, I ... [falls asleep and immediately starts snoring]
-- That's pretty amazing, too, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% The next morning, Marge hasn't gotten a wink of sleep.  Even worse,
% Homer demonstrates he can snore even while awake.  They give in, and
% decide to take up Artie on his offer.
%
% But they're not going to cater to Artie's every whim.  Before Marge
% leaves, Homer lays down the terms of the agreement.

Homer:	Okay, Artie, you get her for the weekend -- but no funny 
	stuff.  And by "funny stuff" I mean hand-holding, goo-goo 
	eyes, misdirected woo -- which is pretty much any John Woo 
	film ...
Artie:	Your wife's virtue shall remain as untouched as Bill 
	Gates' weight room.
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% So Marge kisses Homer goodbye, boards Artie's helicopter, and begins
% the trip to his mansion.  As she leaves, she sees Homer point to a
% message he spelled out in rocks on the lawn:  "Keep your clothes
% on."
%
% Homer's feeling pretty good about the bargain he struck, and he
% tells the guys down at Moe's.

Homer:	This round's on me, Moe.  I've got a big payday coming.
Lenny:	Yeah!  Homer sold his wife for a million bucks.
Homer:	I didn't sell her, I just rented her -- to an old 
	boyfriend.
Moe:	Gee, a million bucks.  That's going to buy him a lot of, 
	uh, swings in the old battin' cage.
Lenny:	Looks like everyone's a winner.  Marge gets a great new 
	life.
Carl:	[to Homer] And you get more sprawl space on the bed.
Homer:	Wait, you really think Marge is going to fall for this 
	guy?  Even after I bought her that hockey fight tape?
Carl:	I'd dump your ass.
Lenny:	Me, too.
Moe:	Yeah, I can't get Artie out of my head.  He's like a spy 
	in the House of Moe.
Homer:	Oh, God, you're right!  I've got to get her back before 
	it's too late!  [runs out of the bar]
-- Seller's remorse, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Meanwhile, at stately Ziff manor, Artie is dressed to the nines,
% 70s-style.  He walks to his guest house and rings the bell.  Marge,
% also dressed up, greets him they leave for a large building on
% Artie's compound.

Marge:	Where are you taking me?
Artie:	We're taking a trip through time.
Marge:	Forwards?
Artie:	No.  [throws open the door to the building] Backwards!  To 
	the sexy seventies!
Marge:	Oh, my God!  Artie, it's our senior prom!
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Indeed, it is.  Artie has painstaking recreated the Springfield High
% School gym.  Everything is as it looked that night in 1974 -- the
% decorations, the outfits, even the people dancing.  Artie paid the
% people who were originally there to dress in 1970s fashion and dance
% the night away.

Artie:	Marge, many years ago I took a groovy night and turned it 
	into a complete bummer.  Tonight, you get the prom you 
	always deserved.  [points to the band, and they begin 
	playing, "Precious and Few"]
Marge:	Aw, that's very sweet, Artie.
Artie:	Come dear, we can dance all night.  The band hasn't worked 
	since the wrap party for "James at 16."  [whispers] Some 
	say they're cursed.
-- Oh, no!  Not the Simpsons curse!  "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Meanwhile, Homer has made it to Artie's mansion.  Stopping briefly
% to kick a statue of Artie, he runs up to the prom building.

Homer:		Oh, my God, it's our high school prom.  And once 
		again, I have no date!
Dondelinger:	[grabs Homer by the collar] Simpson!
Homer:		Hello, Dondelinger.
Dondelinger:	You're not on the guest list, Simpson.  Orders of 
		Prom King Ziff.  [sniffs] And have you been 
		drinking?
Homer:		Just for twenty-five years.
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Dondelinger drags Homer away from the door.  Inside, Artie and Marge
% finish their dance.

Marge:	You're very sweet, but no fake prom could make me forget 
	my husband.  Sorry.
Artie:	Very well, Marge.  I see you'll never feel about moi the 
	way I feel about toi.  But before the evening ends, may I 
	request an innocent peck on the cheek?
Marge:	Okay.  [leans in]
	[Artie begins to kiss her passionately, as Marge struggles 
	to get free.  The camera pans up to a skylight, where 
	Homer sees Artie and Marge in what appears to be a 
	romantic embrace]
Homer:	Oh, no!  If Marge marries Artie, I'll never be born.  
	[cries]
-- Or something like that, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:07]
%
% Marge finally breaks free of her wanna-be suitor, giving him a good
% slap on the face, to boot.

Marge:	I knew this weekend was just an excuse to get in my mouth!  
	Keep your money -- I'm going home!  [angrily walks out of 
	the gym]
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Artie is left sprawled alone on the dance floor.  Everyone stares at
% him, not quite knowing what to do.  Artie tells them to stop staring
% and start dancing again.  Then he awkwardly demonstrates some break-
% dancing moves.
%
% Unfortunately, Homer left the "gym" before seeing any of this.  He
% sits forlornly at Moe's, convinced Marge is ready to leave him for
% his old rival.

Homer:	Oh, guys, it was horrible.  I saw Marge kissing a far 
	superior man.
Moe:	Eh, well, if it makes you feel any better, he's probably 
	doin' her right now.
	[Homer sobs on the bar.  Lenny glares at him]
	Oh, yeah, make me the bad guy.
Homer:	My life here is over.  Lenny, how'd you like to leave town 
	with me and never come back?
Lenny:	Sounds like a plan!
Homer:	Then it's settled -- we leave Springfield forever!
	[the two men walk out.  After they leave, Carl walks out 
	of the men's room]
Carl:	What'd I miss?  Anything good?
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% A taxi pulls up in front of the Simpson house.  Marge, still dressed
% in her prom outfit, gets out.

Cabbie:	That's $912.
Marge:	Send the bill to Baron von Kiss-a-lot.
Cabbie:	No problem-o.  [he drives away]

Baron:	[German accent] Okay, who's the wise guy?
-- Another victim of identity theft, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Marge is surprised to find Homer missing and a videotape on the bed. 
% She plays it.  It is, not surprisingly, from Homer.

Homer:	[to camera] Marge, if you're watching this, then it means 
	I've figured out how to work the camera.  Last night, I 
	crashed a certain "fake prom."  That's right -- Artie 
	Ziff's fake prom.
Marge:	[gasps] Homer was there?
Homer:	I saw something terrible and I can't even say it, so I'll 
	have these two dolls do it for me.  [hold up a stuffed 
	dinosaur and a Funzo doll]
	[wiggling the dinosaur, and speaking in falsetto tone] 
	Kiss me, Artie.
	[wiggling Funzo] With pleasure.  Homer's a big jerk.  
	[brings the dolls together and makes kissing noises]
Marge:	[to the TV] But I can explain!
Homer:	I'm leaving you, Marge.  The next time you see my name 
	will be in the hobo obituaries.  Don't worry about the 
	kids.  I'll drop 'em off with Patty and Selma.
Bart:	[on the tape, but off camera] Patty and Selma?
	Screw that!
Homer:	Just run the camera, you little ... [lunges for Bart, 
	knocking the camera over.  From our point of view, the 
	scenery swings around wildly, until the camera comes to 
	rest pointing to Homer and Bart.  He is simultaneously 
	throttling the boy and crying]
	Goodbye, my darling.
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% By now, Homer and Lenny have boarded a bus and headed out into what
% looks like an arid part of the country.  Homer can't keep his wife
% off his mind.  Even the cacti and clouds remind him of her.  Lenny
% can sympathize.  The bus drives past Mount Carlmore, a huge bust of

Lenny:	I carved that one wonderful summer.
Homer:	What did Carl think?
Lenny:	You know, we've never discussed it.
-- Don't ask, don't tell, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% The bus drops Homer and Lenny off at an oil refinery.  A look at the
% workers hits at what a dangerous place this is to work.  It seems
% that all of the men are missing a hand, or a limb.  One fellow even
% lost his head.  Homer and Lenny approach the foreman.

Homer:		Do you have any jobs for a man who wants to die?  
		Something indoors-y.
Lenny:		Close to a bathroom?
Foreman:	I'll put you on rig 13 as soon as they burn off the 
		corpses.  [hands Homer and Lenny some forms to fill 
		out]
Homer:		[filling out his form] This job will be perfect.  
		I'm going to leave this world the way I entered it --
		dirty, screaming, and torn away from the woman I 
		love.
Lenny:		[chuckles] Quick and pointless -- that's the death 
		for me!
-- Have it your way, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Meanwhile, Homer's family tries to track him down.  Bart does a

% Then, Marge gets an idea ...
%
% Cut to Artie Ziff's helicopter, which is flying low over West
% Springfield.

Marge:	I really appreciate you helping me find Homer.
Artie:	Think nothing of it, Marge.  I hope we can always be

Artie:	No.  But when it does -- hello!
-- "Half-Decent Proposal"

% At rig 13, Homer and Lenny cap the well.  They raise their goggles
% in triumph.  The seemingly innocuous gesture soon goes awry.  The
% goggles focus the sun's rays on a lone ant walking by the well,
% catching it on fire.  The ant runs into the anthill.  Seconds later,
% the whole colony of ants, all of them aflame, rush out.  They try to
% douse the flames by leaping into the nearest puddle of liquid, which
% in this case would be a small pool of oil that has collected near
% the well.  It immediately catches fire, and Homer and Lenny are
% surrounded by flames.  "Oh, no!  This is how faceless Joe lost his
% legs," Homer shouts.  Lenny, however, is nonchalant about his
% imminent doom.
%
% Just then, Artie's helicopter flies over the well.  Marge opens the
% side door, and lets down a rope ladder to the two men.

Marge:	Climb up!  [Lenny starts to do so, but Homer stays on the 
	rig]
Lenny:	Ain't you coming, Homer?
Homer:	Why?  So I can watch my wife spend the rest of her life in 
	the arms of another man?  I don't think so.  Good day!  
	[turns his back on the ladder]
Marge:	But Homer!
Homer:	[pulls Lenny off the ladder] We said, "Good day!"
-- "We?"  "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Artie pokes his head out the door.  "You've won," he yells, "You own
% Marge's heart, and that's something I could never buy."  Homer
% starts climbing the ladder, but now Lenny seems reluctant to go. 
% "There's nothing on that helicopter for me," he says.  Just then,
% Carl appears at the helicopter door.  Overjoyed, Lenny follows Homer
% up the ladder.
%
% Back at home, Homer thanks Artie for the rescue.  He also tries to
% collect his million-dollar fee, but Marge won't let him.  Homer is
% exasperated.

I can't take his money.  I can't print my own money.  I have to work

-- Homer Simpson, "Half-Decent Proposal"

% Artie reminds Homer of the lesson of this adventure -- that he's
% "rich, rich, rich!"  With that, he boards his helicopter and leaves.
%
% In the end, though, it looks like Artie was able to help out Marge
% and Homer after all.  His latest invention is a snore converter. 
% The device looks ominously like a gas mask.  When the snorer straps
% it on, it converts the sound of his snoring into music --
% specifically, "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This" by Eurythmics.  With
% the device working, Homer and Marge settle into bed.

Artie:	[via a speaker on the converter] He's a loser, Marge --
