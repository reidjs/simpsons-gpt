% On another pleasant night in Springfield, the Simpson family watches
% TV in the living room.  Tonight's fare on "Thousand Dollar Movie" is
% "Roger Corman's 'Titanic.'"
%
% On the screen, a cheaply-produced ship crashes head-on into an
% enormous iceberg, dropping it straight into the ocean.  A pair of
% characters looking something like the two stars of the more famous
% movie row immediately away  from the accident.

Man:      We're safe now, Clarice.  We made it away from that ...
          cursed ship.
Clarice:  Now I can relax and take off this stifling bikini.
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% Clarice tries to undo the knot holding on her "stifling bikini" while
% the blond-haired man in the boat grins in anticipation.  Suddenly, the
% formerly submerged Titanic rises up out of the water, attacking the
% couple with a set of jaws it has, rather remarkably, grown.  Marge, a
% bit more into this pitiful attempt at moviemaking than any person of
% average intelligence should be (of course, that's what I said about
% the "real" version of "Titanic" and the whole damn world fell for it),
% yells out a warning to the characters on the screen.  Just as the boat
% is about to swallow them, the "Thousand Dollar Movie" sign pops up.

TV Announcer:  We'll return for the remainder of the conclusion, after
               these messages.
Homer:         Well, I'd rather get a message than see another lousy
               commercial.
--Perhaps a P.S.A. would satisfy the gentleman?, "Mayored to the Mob"

% The commercial on TV is one of two hideously ugly green aliens seated
% at the controls of a flying saucer.  While one of them uses an alien-
% like  voice, the other sounds noticeably like Marty, from KBBL.

Phil:     People of Earth.  We have traveled all the way from space to
          attend the most astrotastic event in the entire universe!
Marty:    [laughs] You said it, Phil.  It's the bi-monthly Springfield
          Sci-Fi Convention.
Phil:     That's right.  It's "Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con".  Come meet all your
          favorite stars!  Mark Hamill!  [Mark's head spins onto the
          screen]  Alf!  [as does Alf's]  And many more!  [this time,
          both Mark's and Alf's heads fly on-screen simultaneously]
Marty:    Plus, tag-team robot wrestling!  It's the mighty robots of
          Battlestar Galactica, versus the gay robots of Star Wars!

% A quick shot of C3PO getting his head pounded by a Battlestar
% Galactica robot is shown; as the robot pleads for help from R2D2, the
% wheeled robot makes a few characteristic noises of refusal, and is
% accordingly cursed in  a rather effeminate way.  "Remember," says
% Phil, "It's 'Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con!"  Be there ... and be square!"
%
% Homer and Bart decide this beats both work and school, so the
% Simpsons end up attending the convention, which is packed with all
% kinds of nerdy rabble.  At the door, the Pimple-Faced Teen has to
% refuse entry to a man in a Chewbacca costume, who roars in discontent.

Are you sure this is the Sci-Fi Convention?  It's full of nerds!

% the melons as though they were the actual people.  Homer, slurping
% away at his "Ann Landers" watermelon, stops eating for a moment to ask
% "What?".  Later, the instructor sits on a hill with a rifle, aiming it
% at a watermelon placed on top of a podium.

% The Simpsons watch the newscast at home.

Bart:     Aren't you scared, Dad?  I mean, if I were Fat Tony, and God
          willing, someday I will be, I'd just be stewin' in my jail
          cell, getting madder and madder.
Homer:    Oh, don't worry about that, boy.  He's already out on bail.
          Well, I'm off to work!
Marge:    You're guarding the mayor tonight?  After Fat Tony swore
          revenge?
Homer:    It's my duty, Marge.  Besides, those mobsters don't scare me.
          Bart, would you go start Daddy's car?
Marge:    Homer!
Homer:    What?  There's nothing to worry about!
Bart:     Well, then you start it!
Homer:    All right, fine, I'll take a cab.

% At the Mayor's house, Homer rings the doorbell, which plays "Hail to
% the Chief".  Quimby himself answers.

Quimby:   Homer, I'm not, uh, sure it's wise to go out right now.  I
          was thinking of a quiet evening at home with the ... [sighs]
          wife.
Homer:    Oh, I get it, you're worried about those mobsters, aren't
          you?
Quimby:   No, no, I truly do want to stay home with the ... [sighs]
          wife.
Homer:    You've got to snap out of this funk, mayor.  I'm gonna take
          you someplace where you can relax and forget all about
          gangsters.
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% The location Homer picks is a Springfield Dinner Theatre showing of
% "Guys and Dolls".  While there, Homer taps a man on the shoulder.

Homer:    Uh, excuse me.
Usher:    [bizarre, sycophantic voice] Yeeeees?
Homer:    Do you have a table for the mayor?
Usher:    Yeeees!
Homer:    Why do you talk that way?
Usher:    I had a strooooooke!
-- Or he listened to the Jack Benny show too many times,
   "Mayored to the Mob"

% Led into the theatre, Homer scans the horizon for trouble.  Nearby,
% Ned and his family say a prayer over their dinner.

Dear Lord, please make tonight's production better than "Othello" with
Peter Marshall.
-- Ned Flanders, dinner theater patron, "Mayored to the Mob"

% Homer spots Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, and the Lovejoys, and does a double-
% take after seeing the gangster, who lifts his glass in greetings to
% Homer.

Homer:     All right, Fat Tony, if it's trouble with Quimby you're
           after ...
Fat Tony:  Please.  I am only here as a devotee of the lively arts.
           But I do have something for the mayor that perhaps you could
           deliver.
           [Homer walks back over to his boss]
Homer:     Mayor?  Fat Tony asked me to give you this.  [kisses him]
Quimby:    You moron!  That's the kiss of death!
Homer:     Oh no!  Wait.  Maybe I didn't do it right!
Quimby:    Never mind that, just go and patrol the perimeter.
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% The waiter delivers Quimby his dinner, including Au Gratin potatoes,
% which Quimby enthusiastically declares "a quality side."  As he is
% about to take a bite, Homer looks to Fat Tony, who lifts his glass to
% Homer once again, smiling.  Panicking, he runs over to the mayor,
% jumping through the air, and eating the potatoes clean off Quimby's
% fork.  Chewing them, he declares the potatoes clean and goes to test
% the steak for poison, eating a bit more than necessary.
%
% Later, the cast of the show perform a musical number, singing "Guys
% And Dolls" to the tune of "Hooray for Hollywood".

Singers:  Guys and dolls!
          We're just a bunch of crazy guys and dolls!
          Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, guys and dolls ...
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% Meanwhile, Mark Hamill, dressed as Luke Skywalker, talks with one of
% the show's "producers", wearing a cook's outfit.

Hamill:    This is a conceptual nightmare!  I mean, Nathan Detroit
           would never wear this!  And this song isn't even in the
           show!
Producer:  I don't have time for this.  I got seventy-five shortcakes
           to strawberry.  Now get out there, Luke.
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% Mark sighs, then walks out on stage to sing the "Guys and Dolls"
% song, swinging his lightsabre leisurely about, the other singers
% joining in.  Mayor Quimby, enjoying the show a bit more than any
% person of average intelligence should (haven't I used that line
% already?), is oblivious to Lenny taking diction from Fat Tony on who
% to off.

Fat Tony:  I want the mayor dead, I want his wife dead, I want his cat
           and dog dead.
Lenny:     Wait, wait, wait, who was before the cat?
Fat Tony:  [sighs] Just kill the mayor.
Lenny:     [walks off, then comes back] You're not mad at me, are you?
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% Meanwhile, on stage, Mark, wearing his Skywalker costume with a top
% hat, does another song.

Hamill:          Luke, be a Jedi tonight!
                 Just be a Jedi tonight!
Hamill & Chorus: Do it for Yoda, while we serve our guests a soda.
Hamill:          Uh, and do it for Chewie and the Ewoks, and all the
                 other puppets ...
Hamill & Chorus: Luke, be a Jedi tonight!
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% On the floor, Lenny is about to toss a dagger at the mayor, when the
% chef/producer grabs him by the arm.

Producer:  Hey, you're in this number!  Get out there and shake that
           money-maker!
Lenny:     But I'm just here to kill ... aaah!  [gets pushed on stage]
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% Thrust into the spotlight, Lenny, unsure of what to do, holds his
% knife in his mouth and does a dance number to a drum solo.

Homer:    That guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?
Quimby:   He looks awfully familiar.
Homer:    I think I saw him in "Rent", or "Stomp", or "Clomp", or some
          piece of crap.
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% Finishing his act, Lenny does a kneeslide to center stage to wild
% applause.  Mark Hamill takes him aside.

Hamill:   Hey, pal.  That's my headshot up there next to the pepper
          steak, and don't you forget it.
Lenny:    You're all talk, Hamill!  You never even finished Jedi
          school!
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% Lenny punches Mark in the face, sending him into a Barbershop
% backdrop.  Jumping onto the mayor's table, he shouts "Show's over!"
% and prepares to stab him, when Homer tackles him, pushing the mayor
% away.  Locked into a life and death struggle with Lenny with a knife
% in his face, Mark Hamill shouts some advice over to Homer.

Hamill:   Homer!  Use the for ...
Homer:    The Force?
Hamill:   The forks!  Use the forks!
Homer:    Oh.
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% Picking two of them up, Homer catches the knife in between the fork's
% prongs and manages to pull the knife out of Lenny's hands.  He stabs
% the fork into the table, through Lenny's tie, trapping him there.  The
% knife flies through the air and hits the stage, nearly missing Mark.

Homer:     Yes!  Nobody messes with the mayor when Homer Simpson's on
           ... oh, crap.
           [notices Fat Tony, who is beating the mayor with a baseball
           bat]
Homer:     Oh, Fat Tony ...
Fat Tony:  What?  What did I do?
-- "Mayored to the Mob"

% Fat Tony runs off, and the Dinner Theater soon closes.  Homer,
% sitting alone on stage, is approached by Mark Hamill.

Hamill:   I checked with the doctor, he said Mayor Quimby's gonna be
          fine.  And I was electric as Nathan Detroit.  What did you
          think of me?
Homer:    Actually, you were luminous, magnetic ... [sighs]
          incandescent.
Hamill:   Oh, cheer up, Homer.  I think you made a great bodyguard.
Homer:    Really?  Would you say I was magnetic?
Hamill:   Absolutely.
Homer:    Aww ...
-- Mutual admiration society, "Mayored to the Mob"

% Walking out the backstage door, they come across a crowd of people
% all begging for Hamill's attention.  "Homer, I think you know what to
% do," Hamill says.  Accompanied by Whitney Houston's "I Will Always
% Love You", Homer picks Mark Hamill up and kicks his way through the
% crowd, going back once for Mark's lightsabre, until Mark realizes he
% had it all along.  Homer sighs, having to walk back through the crowd
% for no reason.  Fade out, as the "Bodyguard" theme plays through the
% credits.
