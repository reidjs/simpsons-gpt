% The studio doors open.

B: You know, I base my whole life on Krusty's teachings.

% They go inside.

L: Wow, the glamorous world of TV.
B: Ho, you gotta be kidding.
   How can they expect a genius like Krusty to work in a dump like this?

% The show begins.

K: Hi, boys and girls!  Come on board the Krusty the Clown show! [laughs]

% Pan over to the studio audience, Bart and the girls in attendance.
% Maggie sucks on her pacifier.

   That's just some lumpy ol' dude in a clown suit.

% Krusty concludes his introduction.

K: ... and Chunky the Pig.

% Cheers from the audience.

B: Oh yeah?  Then what's Krusty's secret motto?
K: Eh...  [remembers]  Oh.
   ``Instead of feeling sad and blue, keep a Krusty smile on you!''
B: Listen, pal.  I don't know how you found out Krusty's secret motto,
   but you're still an impostor!

% Bart rips off Krusty's fake red nose.  The audience boos.
% Bart yanks the microphone out of Krusty's hands (sending Krusty
% face down onto the floor).

B: Kids in TV land, you're being duped!

% Krusty grabs Bart by the neck and starts strangling him.

K: [in a gruff voice]  Why, you little...
B: Lll-lll-lll-lll...
