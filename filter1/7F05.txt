% At Moe's Tavern, the gang beg Homer to tell his story...

Homer:  There's only one thing worse than being a loser.  It's being one
        of those guys who sits in a bar telling a story of how he became
        a loser, and I never want that to happen to me.
Barney: Please, Homer?
Moe:    Yeah, come on, Homer.
Homer:  Well, okay.
-- Homer becomes one of those guys who sits in a bar telling a story of
   how he became a loser, ``Dancin' Homer''

% The story begins at `Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More
% Than Three Children Night', at Springfield War Memorial Stadium to
% watch the local minor-league team, the Springfield Isotopes, known
% as the 'Topes to its fans...

[police sirens wail in the distance]
Heh, I think we lost 'em.  Hey, and we're at the ballpark!  Awright!
Two birds with one stone!
-- Otto drives the bus to the ballpark, ``Dancin' Homer''

% pull back to see the huge set of skid marks leading up to the bus.
% Heading into the stadium...

Homer: You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it
       to the big leagues someday.
Bart:  What?  Aren't we going to see any washed-up major-leaguers?
Homer: Sure!  We get a nice mix here.
-- At the ballpark to watch the local minor league team, ``Dancin' Homer''

% Lisa looks forward to seeing poetry in motion, but Homer looks forward
% to the 72-ounce tubs of beer.

Marge: Last year you got a little rambunction and mooned the poor umpire.
Homer: Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the
       right, no, the duty! to make a complete ass of myself.
Marge: Mph.
-- At the ballpark to watch the local minor league team, ``Dancin' Homer''

% At the gate, Mr. Burns greets each family as it arrives.

Burns: Ah, the Gammels.  Good to see you.
Mr.G.: You're an inspiration to all of us in waste management, sir.
Burns: Well, take your mind off contaminants for one night and have a hot dog!
       [laughs]
-- Out of the frying pan... ``Dancin' Homer''

Burns: Ah, well, if it isn't the Simps!
Homer: Uh, it's Simp-son, sir.
Burns: Eh?  [refers to the index card] Oh, yes.  Homer and Marge Simpson.
       Oh, and these must be Bart, Lisa, and uh, `expecting'.
-- At Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night
   ``Dancin' Homer''

% At the stadium, Flash Baylor doesn't sign a baseball for Bart, so
% Marge angrily takes the ball and approaches him.  She returns with the
% ball...

Marge: Here you go, Bart.
Bart:  [reads the inscription]  Springfield Kozy Kourt Motel, Room 26,
       How about it? -- Flash.
Homer: Wow!  Flash Baylor came onto my wife!  You've still got the magic,
       Marge.
-- Marge gets a baseball autographed, ``Dancin' Homer''

% Homer appears on `Jumbo-Vision', and is embarrassed to find that his
% zipper is undone.

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, throwing out tonight's first ball,
           the man whose name is synonymous with our nation's safest
           and cleanest energy source, Mr. Montgomery Burns!
           [isolated smatterings of applause]
Smithers:  Oh, they love you, sir.
-- At the ballpark, ``Dancin' Homer''

% Burns only manages to throw the ball two feet and is taunted by Homer,
% Bart, and even Lisa.  The National Anthem is sung by Bleeding Gums
% Murphy, and Lisa is the one one who manages to stay awake for all of
% it.  The game between the Springfield Isotopes and the pesky Shelbyville
% Shelby-Villians begins, the 'Topes hoping to snap a record 26-game
% losing streak.  Burns is shown to his seat...

Ah, sitting with the employees.  I guess this proves I'm their friend.
Tsk, get me something on an aisle, Smithers, I don't want to be
<surrounded> by them...
-- Monty Burns joins his employees at the ball game, ``Dancin' Homer''

% ... which is right next to Homer.  The two smile nervously at each other.
% Homer bemoans his fate.  Burns orders a tub of beer for himself and
% Homer.

Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?
-- Homer suspects a trap when Burns buys him a beer at the ball game,
   ``Dancin' Homer''

% The cost of two 72-ounce tubs is $2.50.  The game continues,
% and Homer and Burns join in taunting the players, and doing `the wave'
% (which looks pretty stupid with only two people).  It's now the bottom
% of the ninth.  One out, the bases are loaded, and the 'Topes are down
% by three.  The batter strikes out (``of course'').

Big Bill McCloskey coming up.  As soon as he pops out, we'll go right to the
post-game show.
-- Dan Horde calls the game between the 'Topes and Shelbyville,
   ``Dancin' Homer''

% To the music of `Baby Elephant Walk', Homer dances on the dugout and
% fires up the crowd, to the embarrassment of his family.  (Lisa covers
% Maggie's eyes, as well as her own.)

And I got up in front of them.  I felt an intoxication that had nothing to
do with alcohol.  It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle!
-- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''

% And it works.  McCloskey belts a homer out of the park to win the game.
% But Homer's antics earn him a `banned for life' stamp on his index card.
% In the parking lot, a shoadowy figure approaches Homer.  It's Antoine
% Tex O'Hara, the owner, who hires Homer as the team's mascot.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 9:22] [pretty long]
%
% Homer is decked out in his goofy `Dancin' Homer' outfit and drags the
% family away from dinner to go to the game.

Our lives have taken an odd turn.
-- Lisa comments on Homer's goofy costume as... ``Dancin' Homer''

Homer:     Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids.  Save room for your nachos!
Lisa+Bart: All right!
Marge:     [disapprovingly] Mmm.
-- Homer takes the kids to the ballpark dressed as... ``Dancin' Homer''

% At the park, Homer is a hit.

For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me,
they were laughing <towards> me!
-- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''

% The 'Topes win a second game, and Homer eventually gets top billing on
% the signage.

A Simpson on a T-shirt.  I never thought I'd see the day...
-- Marge reacts disapprovingly to Homer's likeness on a T-shirt,
   ``Dancin' Homer''

% Homer tries to cast a spell on an opposing player, and gets threatened.
% He asks the organist to play `Baby Elephant Walk' with a reggae beat.
% And two long-haired Caribbean types express their approval.  It's the
% bottom of the ninth, the bases are loaded, and there are two outs...

S! P! R! I! N! G! F! E! E! L! D!!  Springfield!!!!!
-- Homer spells out the town name while dressed as... ``Dancin' Homer''

% But it doesn't help; the 'Topes lose.  Homer is called to Tex's office
% and is informed that he's going to be promoted to the big leagues, to
% fill in for the Capital City Goofball a couple innings a night.

Tex:   Why don't you talk it over with your family?
Homer: Because they might say no.
-- Homer learns he's being promoted to work for the Capital City team,
   ``Dancin' Homer''

This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced.
I should've listened to the kids instead of my big, dumb wife.
Oh, I shouldn't have called her that.
Bite my tongue.  Bite my tongue.  Mmph.  Ow!
-- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''

% He tells the family...

Lisa:  I can't leave Springfield!
       I was born here and I thought I would die here!
Homer: It won't be so bad.  You'll die someplace else.
-- On moving to Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''

% Bart fears losing his friends, but Homer says he'll make new ones.

We're simple people with simple values.  Capital City is too big and
too complex.  Everyone in Springfield knows us and has forgiven us.
-- Lisa lists some reasons not to move to Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''

% But Marge tells Homer that this may be his calling in life and he should
% go for it.  The kids are won over.

Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger!
-- Lisa gives in and agrees to move to Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''
   [paraphrasing Nietzsche]

% Even Maggie raises her arms in triumph.  Homer asks his supervisor for
% a leave of absence.

Sure, what would you like?  Four years?  Five years.
-- Homer's supervisor grants him a leave of absence, ``Dancin' Homer''

% The family holds a yard sale, and Ned has trouble finding the right words...

Ned:   I don't know how to say this, but uh...
Homer: Oh, knock it off, Flanders; don't start blubbering on me.
       I'll miss you too.... [aside] not.
-- Homer prepares to move to Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''

% In the treehouse, Bart and Millhouse seal their bond as `spit brothers'.
% (``Ewwww...'')

Lisa:    I can't help but fell that if we had gotten to know each other
         better, my leaving would actually have meant something.
Friends: Yeah.
-- Lisa bids farewell to her classmates, ``Dancin' Homer''

% Marge bids farewell to her sisters, and Homer gives a tearful farewell
% speech to his fans at Homer Appreciation Night.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:42]
%
% The car is packed, and the family drive to Capital City.  They arrive
% at night and are awed at being in the city.  They admire the sights...

Kids, look!  Street crime!
-- Homer drives the family through Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''

% then check into the Come Back motel for the night.  Homer practices his
% spelling, but Marge tells him to come to bed.  ``We would talk about it
% always.  For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did.''
%
% At the stadium, Homer goes in the ``Players-Mascots Entrance'', while
% Marge and the kids get their tickets in the players' wives section.

Bart was strangely quiet.  Later, he explained he was confused by feelings
of respect for me.  It wouldn't last.
-- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''

% Homer talks to the Capital City Goofball (``If there's anything I can do
% for you, just squeeze the wheeze'' [squeezes his nose, which honks]),
% and learns he's going to be doing the fifth inning.

Goof:  What exactly do you have planned for us?
Homer: Well, I get up and dance, and I spell out the name of the city,
       all to the tune of `Baby Elephant Walk'.
Goof:  Ah, Mancini.  The mascot's best friend.
-- Homer and the Capital City Goofball plan their strategy, ``Dancin' Homer''

% On his way out, Goof bumps into a hanging lamp.

Well, hello again, everybody.  Dave Glass talking at ya.
We've got great weather here tonight, under the dome...
-- Calling the baseball game, ``Dancin' Homer''

% Marge and the kids get seats in the upper-upper-upper-mezzanine, and it's
% not the players' wives section; it's the players' ex-wives section.

Homer:  [narrating] I was too tense to enjoy the game.  Every ounce of
        concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.
Vendor: Red hots!  Getcher red hots here!
Homer:  Ooh, red hots!
-- ``Dancin' Homer''

% The spotlight shines on Homer, who quickly scarfs down his hot dog and beer,
% then launches into his act.  But he's a total flop.  He is called into
% the owner's office, who fires him (``and for God's sake, put some clothes
% on.'')  The family wait depressed outside the ``players-mascot'' entrance,
% but they put up a good front for Homer when he comes out.

Oh, what a family.  My wife and kids stood by me.  On the way home, I
realized how little that helped...
-- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''

% And that's the story.  Homer is amazed that everyone was hanging on his
% every word.  The bar denizens beg Homer to tell it again, and he agrees.
% ``I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more
% popular.''  Moe responds, ``I dunno.  They just do.''
