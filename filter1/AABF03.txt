Lisa:          Aw, way to go, Ralph.
Gil:           [appearing suddenly]  D'ah, she's a beut'.  You can't
               beat a Coleco, eh ...?  How many can I put ya' down for,
               a lot?  Please say "a lot," I need this.
Skinner:       I dunno.  I'm not even sure we can keep this one.  It's
               up to Lisa.
Chalmers:      Whaddayasay, Lisa?  Will you keep our little secret for
               the good of your classmates and your school?
Gil:           And let's not forget ol' Gil, huh?  The wolf's at old
               Gil's door.
               [Lisa looks around at Skinner and Chalmers who look back
               anxiously, and at Ralph, who is happily picking his
               nose]
Lisa:          Oooh ... I guess I don't have much choice.
Gil:           Aw, thank God!  Now, let's talk rust-proofing.  These
               Colecos'll rust up on ya' like =that=, er ... shut up,
               Gil.  Close the deal ... close the deal!

% We leave Springfield Elementary to join Homer, Marge and Pinchy, who
% are taking a walk on the beach.

Homer:         [to Pinchy]  Relax, boy.  We're not gonna cook you!
               Enjoy your day at the beach.  Ooh, look, here's a little
               playmate for ya'.  [he picks up a snail and puts it in
               front of Pinchy, who gets bitten]  Hey!  You don't have
               to take that from no punk-ass crab!  What's wrong with
               you?  [Captain McAllister walks on]
McAllister:    Y'arr, it's not his fault he's a sissy.  =Someone's=
               been =coddling= him.
Marge:         Don't look at me!  I wanted to eat him!
McAllister:    Eh, sorry, it's usually the mother.  Eh, y-you know, I
               run a small academy for lobsters like this one.  We
               stress tough love.  Daily chores and the like.
Marge:         No!  We're not sending the lobster away to some snobby
               boarding school.
McAllister:    Y'arr, I understand.  It's hard to let go.  Eh, tell me
               this, then ... do you have any spare change?
-- "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% It's nighttime, and many people are assembled inside the auditorium
% at Springfield Elementary.  Skinner, Chalmers, Lisa and an
% unidentified man are all onstage.

Skinner:  And now, to present the grant money, a legendary figure in
          educational disbursement, state Comptroller Atkins!
          [applause]
Atkins:   Thank you.  I'm here tonight to honor the girl whose
          unprecedented test score has set a new standard in
          excellence.  Lisa?  [more applause as Lisa takes the podium]
Lisa:     Thank you.  I know this giant check is very important to
          everyone here, but ... what's even more important is the
          truth.
          [everyone looks confused, and Skinner makes "cut" guesture]
          Because, after all, education is the search for truth.
Skinner:  No, no it isn't.  Don't listen to her.  She's out of her
          mind!
Lisa:     And the truth is, we don't deserve this grant, and I don't
          deserve your applause.  I cheated on that test.
          [audience boos]
Atkins:   Wait!  How dare you condemn this girl.  Who among =you= can
          honestly say you've never cheated ... on your wives ... or
          your husbands?  What she just did took courage, and where I
          come from, Canada, we reward courage.  So I hearby decree
          that you keep the grant.  And let's give this brave girl the
          ovation she deserves!
          [everyone cheers, and OFF greets Lisa at the podium and
          carries her out of the room]
Marge:    Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.  You got the highest grade in
          the class.
Lisa:     But, Mo-om ...
Marge:    The highest grade!
-- "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% Bart slams the doors shut as they leave and throws a broom through
% the handles.  "Okay, Lisa's gone!" he shouts, and the crowd murmurs
% and returns to their seats.  The comptroller pulls off a face mask and
% is revealed to be Otto, who walks off saying "Oh, man!  Acting is
% tough!  I'll be in my trailer."

Skinner:       Ah, good old predictable Lisa.  I knew her conscience
               was a ticking time bomb.
Krabappel:     Heads up!  Here comes the =real= comptroller.
               [a few minutes later, a man similar to Otto's role, with
               a slightly different voice, is handing an oversized
               check to Skinner]
Atkins:        This grant ensures a light bulb in every classroom, and
               a high-definition TV for the teachers' lounge.
               [applause]
               Now, where's the little girl who made this grant
               possible?  Where's Lisa Simpson?
               [a poorly made dummy of Lisa pops up on a poll in the
               back of the room, which we see is being controlled by
               Bart, low in his seat.  The comptroller offers for her
               to come on up, but she shakes her head "no"]
Atkins:        Well, how about that?  Smart =and= modest!  Well, I
               should be going now.  These giant checks don't hand
               themselves out.
Skinner:       Okay, people!  Let's have a round of applause for the
               =real= comptroller!
Atkins:        Huh?
Chalmers:      [under his breath]  Idiot.
               [walks Mr. Atkins out of the room]
Skinner:       I know a liquor store where we can cash this right now!
-- "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% Lisa is at home with a marker, changing her "A+++" into the top
% horizontal line of a big, red "F."

Lisa:     That's one grade I truly earned.
Marge:    Mmmm ... who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?
Homer:    Sorry, Marge.  Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing
          birds.  But don't worry!  I put him in a nice, hot bath.
Bart:     [sniffs the air]  Hey, what smells so good?
Homer:    Yeah ... Pinchy?  Pinchy!?!  Oh ... =Pinchy=!!!!!
          [he runs out of the room worried]
-- Whoops, "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% Later that night, Homer is crying at the dining room table, taking
% bites out of Pinchy's dead body while the family is watching.

Homer:    [eating, crying]  Oh, man, that's good.  [sob]  Pass the
          butter.
Bart:     Are you gonna eat that all by yourself?
Homer:    Uh-huh.  Pinchy would've wanted it this way.  My dear, sweet
          Pinchy.  [takes a bite]  No more pain where you are now, boy.
          [rips him in half and sucks out the meat inside]
          Oh, God, that's tasty!  I wish Pinchy were here to enjoy
          this.
          [takes more bites]  Oh, Pinchy ...
