% It's another evening in Springfield.  At the Simpsons residence,
% Homer has tucked Lisa in and is telling her a bedtime fairy tale.

Homer:    And then the handsome prince realized he had to go to the
          bathroom really bad, but the evil ogre -- Barney -- had left
          the men's room in the most wicked condition!  So the prince
          went out back to the enchanted alley --
Lisa:     [interrupting] That's not a fairy tale; it's something that
          happened to you at Moe's!
Homer:    Sssh. Anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years,
          until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon!

% Meanwhile, in Bart's bedroom, Marge is watching him pray before going
% to sleep.

And thank you, God, for the bad stuff adults do, which distracts
attention from stuff I'm doing.  Amen.
-- Bart, praying, "I'm With Cupid"

% Marge adds, "he's also thankful for your bounty, Lord."  Bart says
% good night to Marge, and she does the same to Bart.  Then Bart springs
% a surprise on his mother:  He has to make a model of the digestive
% system for a school project -- due tomorrow.  Marge scolds her son,
% but eventually caves and agrees to make the whole thing.  At the Kwik-
% E-Mart, she purchases the materials for the model.

Apu:      OK, paper mache mix, pipe cleaners, pig intestines, and
          sparkle paint!
Marge:    You're a life saver, Apu.  All the other stores are closed!
Apu:      [gasp] At 11:30?  But this is the peak hour for stoned
          teenagers buying shiny things!
Jimbo:    [elsewhere in the store, observing a roll of tin foil] Whoa,
          it's a living mirror ... cool hat!
Marge:    Well, I'm glad you're always here, but isn't it a little
          rough on  your marriage?
Apu:      You know, Manjula understands.  I told her that endless toil
          is the only true path out of this jerk-water berg.
Marge:    Well, if you have a free night, we'd love to have you two
          over for dinner!
Apu:      Oh, please, do not be insane - you hosted our wedding!  The
          least we could do is have you over for dinner.  [grimly
          serious]  It is payback time, and this time ... it's
          personal.

% The next morning, Marge sits at the kitchen table, and makes a final
% adjustment to Bart's project.  The kids come in.  Bart congratulates
% her, and Lisa praises it for sounding so real -- a faint rumbling can
% be heard.  The rumbling is, in fact, Homer stood at the refrigerator,
% clutching his unsatisfied stomach.

[in pain] Ooohh ... I'm never eating chili again ...  [spirits rise]
Ooh, chili!
-- Homer finding some food in the refrigerator, "I'm With Cupid"

% The students of Springfield Elementary are sat in the school bus,
% holding their precious projects.  Nelson pops up from behind Bart's
% seat and begins messing about with Bart's project.  Sarcastically
% claiming to be "solving world hunger," Nelson grabs an intestine and
% shoves it into the mouth on the model's head.  The fluid pumping
% through the intestines starts blocking in the mouth, and the model
% inflates.  Otto notices it in the rear view mirror and warns the kids,
% but it's too late.  The kids scream as the model implodes and sends
% gunk all over the inside of the bus.

Bart: I hope you're happy, Nelson.
Nelson: Very.  But I can't help wondering where I go from here ...
-- Nelson, after blowing up Bart's science project, "I'm With Cupid"

% Later that day, Sanjay is minding the Kwik-E-Mart.

Sanjay:   Stop worrying, Apu, the Kwik-E-Mart is in good hands!
          [cut to Apu's apartment]
Apu:      I am not checking up on you, I am simply asking you how many
          pennies you have left.  SEVEN?!  I'll be right there!
-- Apu, paranoid about leaving the store for a night, "I'm With Cupid"

% Manjula takes the receiver from Apu's hand, and tells Sanjay that Apu
% won't be right there; that he's entertaining tonight, and to get
% pennies from Jerry's [as in Jerry Lewis] jar.  They embrace.

Apu:      This is why I married you.  Whoo, what an outfit!  You are
          one ma-hot-mama!
Manjula:  You think so?
Apu:      Why, I could not let you in the store like that because you
          are smoking!
Manjula:  [flattered] Oh, Apu ...  [they kiss, as the door bell rings]
Apu:      Maybe we should not answer it, uh?
Homer:    [walks in with Marge] Door's unlocked.
-- Ruining the moment again, "I'm With Cupid"

% Surprised, Manjula and Apu welcome Marge and Homer to their Indian-
% esque apartment.

Marge:    What a lovely home!
Manjula:  Oh, you are too kind, Marge ...  I am sure you have noticed
          the many small imperfections that fill me with shame.
Marge:    Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no ...  if anything, your home
          makes me ashamed of my home.
Manjula:  Let us say we both feel bad!
Marge:    Deal!
-- ... you should really get out more, "I'm With Cupid"

% Apu asks Homer who his favorite Indian pop singer is.  Homer doesn't
% want to choose, so Apu chooses one.  He places a vinyl record onto his
% player, and it's a loud mixture of stereotypical Indian music,
% involving shouting and screaming and high speed music playing.  Apu
% realizes he is playing it at the wrong speed, and quickly alters it,
% revealing the album is in fact a Frank Sinatra type selection.  Later,
% the two couples are about to eat their food.

Good rice, good curry, good Ghandi, let's hurry.
-- Apu, saying grace, "I'm With Cupid"

% They dig in.

Marge:    Mmmm ... this is delicious!  What's in it?
Manjula:  Chickpeas, lentils, and rice.
Marge:    And what's in this?
Manjula:  Chickpeas and lentils.
Apu:      Fried with rice.
-- There might be some chickpeas in there, too, "I'm With Cupid"

% Marge mentions how glad she is that the two couples are having this
% meal together, and Manjula jokes about how dedicated Apu and Homer are
% towards their work.

Marge:    [sarcastically] Oh yeah, Homer's a real go-getter!
Homer:    [sarcastically] Oh yeah, I'm going right to the top!  [both
          laugh]

-- "I'm With Cupid"

% Manjula, puzzled, doesn't understand why Homer doesn't work standard
% 18 hour days, seven days a week.  Marge tries to explain about
% weekends, but Manjula is new to such days.

You told me it was an American tradition to work all the time and never
see your wife!
-- Manjula talking to Apu, "I'm With Cupid"

% The couple takes their argument to the kitchen, where Apu closes the
% "door" [a few bead strings hanging from the door frame].

Marge:    [Apu and Manjula argue in Indian] I think we should leave.
Homer:    Uh uh, no way.  I don't wanna miss a word ...
Marge:    But you don't know what they're saying!
Homer:    I'm picking it up ... "sala" seems to mean "jerk," and I
          think "Manjula" means some kind of spaceship ...
-- "I'm With Cupid"

% Apu emerges from the kitchen.

This could take a while, folks.  Thank you, come again!
-- Apu's way of making Homer and Marge leave his and Manjula's
   apartment during an argument, "I'm With Cupid"

% Marge and Homer take the hint and leave.  Marge frets about the
% future of Apu's marriage, but Homer is confident the two will work
% things out.  A book crashes through Apu's window and lands at the
% Simpsons' feet.  It is the "Kama Sutra."  Homer picks it up, and looks
% interested in it.
%
% On their way home, Homer is driving recklessly, distracted by reading
% the copy of the "Kama Sutra."

Marge:    Either put that book down, or let me drive.
          [Homer stops the car, and the two swap places.  Marge drives
          off]

-- Is it anything like the Venus butterfly?  "I'm With Cupid"

[End of Act One.  Time:  6:26]

% The next day, Homer is checking out the Kwik-E-Mart's selection of
% Valentines cards.

Homer:    [reading a Valentines card] I cherish you, my precious.
          Mmmmm ... nah.  [gets another]  To a heck of a blacksmith.
          Nah, I already got him one.  [gets another, this time it has
          monkeys on it.  Homers reads loudly, thinking he's hit the
          jackpot] You're a-peeling, let's never split!  [laughs]  It's
          funny, 'cause they're monkeys!  [laughs more.  Stops, and
          gets the other cards] So long, rejects!  [stuffs them
          sloppily back in the display]  Stupid cards!
-- Yes, Homer, "I'm With Cupid"

% Homer goes to Apu and talks with him about the Manjula situation.
% Apu says things are worse than ever.  Apu fears she'll leave him.

Oh, she's not going to leave you before Valentines Day!  That'd be like
going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash!
-- Homer talking to Apu about Manjula, "I'm With Cupid"

% Apu decides Homer's right, and he has seven more days to prove his
% love for sweet Manjula.  (Or, as Homer hears it, "sweet mint julep.")
%
% The next day, Homer is sat at the breakfast table, encouraging
% Santa's Little Helper to fetch him the newspaper.  He needs quite a
% bit of encouragement, since SLH is fetching the Sunday paper against
% veterinary advice.  Homer takes a look inside the newspaper, finds
% news of a tax hike, and scolds SLH.  Then, he filters out all the pull-
% outs.  Marge wants to read one of them, but Homer selfishly declines.
% He gives her a different pull-out.

Marge:    Hmmm, this is about investment opportunities in Yemen.
Homer:    Give me that!  [snatches it]
-- "I'm With Cupid"

% Well, at least Bart finds something to read.

Bart:     All right, "personals!"  [looks one up]  Successful mayor-

Bart:     Oh, here's one.  Desperately seeking suc-
Marge:    [snatches paper] Heeeey, look at this one ...  [gasp] it's a

Homer:    Don't just gasp.  Read it!
Marge:    [reading] My darling bride Manjula / I hereby mend my ways /
          I'll shower you with Valentines / for seven love-filled days.
Lisa:     Oh, how romantic!
Homer:    [low voice] I used to take out ads like that when we were
          newly  weds.
Marge:    The only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower!
Homer:    We sold it, didn't we?
-- "I'm With Cupid"

% Later on, Manjula and Marge are playing badminton together.

Manjula:  Until last night, I never knew Apu could be so romantic!
Marge:    I can't believe it; he covered your whole bed in wild
          flowers!
Manjula:  Oh, I'm sure Homer has done that for you ...
Marge:    Hmmm, sometimes I find pickle slices in the sheets.
-- How romantic!  "I'm With Cupid"

% The two continue chatting until a parrot swoops into and past Marge,
% and flies to Manjula, perched on her shoulder.  The parrot sings a
% romantic song to her.

          He loves the night life,

          The man they call Apuuu, oh yeah!  Awk!
-- Parrot's romantic song, "I'm With Cupid"

% Marge wishes someone would do that for her.

Marge:    Then the bird sang "I Love the Night Life" with clever new
          lyrics.
Homer:    Yeah, I hate that song.
Marge:    I do too, but it was sweet.  [hinting]  Women really like
          that sort of thing, Homey.
Homer:    Don't worry, honey.  I've got something really special
          planned for Valentine's Day.
Marge:    It's not that monkey card I found in the car, is it?
Homer:    Wouldn't you like to know.
          [rolls over and looks worried]  Ooh.
-- "I'm With Cupid"

% The next day, a truck drops off a huge candy box in front of
% Manjula's apartment building.  She opens it, and is delighted by what
% she finds inside -- a life size chocolate statue of Apu.

Manjula:  A chocolate husband!  Oh, how darling.
Apu:      [from inside "statue"]  Help!  I can't breathe!
          [chocolate cracks and falls from around his head; Apu gasps

Manjula:  Oh, Apu!  Oh, you are the sweetest filling of all.
Apu:      Air ... [pants heavily] Need air.
Manjula:  Oh, Apu.
Apu:      Don't talk, my ears are filled with nougat.

% Chief Wiggum isn't having an easier time of it with his wife.

Wiggum:   ... so then the second salesman says, "That's okay, I just

% On Valentine's eve, Apu's schemes to woo Manjula even make the news.
% Kent Brockman reports that everyone's marriages are on the rocks --

Crowd:         Aw, Moe.  That's too far.  Etc.
Homer:         And ask yourselves, people.  Who's to blame for all

Hibbert:       Well, I guess we are.
Ned:           Well, I do take Maude for granted.
Lenny:         Oh, I've done some of that myself.

Homer:    C'mon, Apu.  Make your move.
Hibbert:  Maybe he's run out of romantic ideas.
Wiggum:   Nah, no, not our loverboy.  If I know his M. O., he's saved

Ned:      Aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for

          for me.
Apu:      Well, you and the health inspector.  [chuckles]  Champagne

Manjula:  Oh, thank you.  [they both sip, through straws]
Apu:      It should get you pretty darn hammered.
