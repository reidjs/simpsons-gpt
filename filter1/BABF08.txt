% The city of Springfield celebrates excellence within its ranks with
% the Springfield Pride Awards.  The event has drawn most of the town 
% to the Civic Arena.  Tonight's emcees are local news anchor Kent
% Brockman, and pop singer Britney Spears.  Judging by audience
% applause, Britney's the one who has captured the crowd's enthusiasm.
%
% Homer is confident that this is his year.  Marge is more doubtful,
% recalling the pre-award buzz about Lenny.

Kent:		Our first Springfield Pride Award goes to a local 
		legend.  A man who brings laughter and joy to the 
		children of Springfield.
Homer:		[gasps in anticipation]
Britney:	With his big red nose and his baggy pants ...
		[Homer stands up]
Kent:		... Krusty the Clown!
Krusty:		[gets up, blocking our view of Homer] Hey, hey!
Homer:		What?!
		[tries to sit back down, but a young man in a tuxedo 
		already occupies his seat]
		Who are you?
Man:		Seat filler.
		[dejected, Homer sits down in the aisle.  The seat 
		filler puts his arm around Marge]
-- "The Mansion Family"

% As the night wears on, everyone in the auditorium has collected an
% award.  That is, everyone except Homer.

Homer:	Everyone gets an award but me.
Marge:	I can't help it if I donated the most blood.  Ohh, but I'm 
	feeling kind of woozy.
	[passes out.  Homer reaches for her award, but she rouses 
	herself in time to slap away his hand]
Homer:	Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?
Lisa:	You won a Grammy.
Homer:	I mean an award that's worth winning.
	["award show"-style music plays while a disclaimer scrolls 
	by on the screen, reading, "LEGAL DISCLAIMER:  Mr. 
	Simpson's opinions does not reflect those of the 
	producers, who don't consider the Grammy an award at 
	all."]
-- With that attitude, you'll never win one, "The Mansion Family"

% The awards continue.

Britney:	You know, Kent, in today's youth-obsessed culture, 
		we sometimes forget that older people are still 
		alive.
		[cut to Abe, who is arguing with the seat-filler]
Abe:		I told ya!
Man:		[not too apologetic] Well, Sor-ry!  [leaves]
		[back to Britney and Kent]
Kent:		And that's why our final award honors a man who's 
		lived in Springfield for 108 years -- our oldest 
		resident, Cornelius Chapman.
		[applause.  A film showing highlights of Mr. 
		Chapman's life begins to play]
Britney:	Cornelius Chapman built the first log cabin in 
		Springfield, and introduced the toothbrush to our 
		fair city.  [the film shows residents of the town 
		pondering this new invention, and then using it.  
		They smile widely]
Kent:		For years, he was Springfield's only basketball 
		player, but he still managed to entertain the crowd.  
		[Chapman dribbles the ball, and tries a pass, but 
		there's no one there to catch it]
Britney:	In the market crash of 1929, he helped people jump 
		out of windows to avoid disgrace.
		[the film shows Chapman doing just that]
Chapman:	[on film] You're doing the right thing.  Oh, oh, out 
		you go!  [a heavyset man appears at the window] My, 
		you're a big one.  No, no, no ... no turning back 
		now.  [the heavyset man jumps]
		[cut to the audience]
Moe:		Off a tall building -- that's a great way to do it!
		[back to the stage]
Kent:		And in 1935, our honoree took a bullet for Huey 
		Long.
		[in the film, Chapman dives in front of a bullet 
		meant for Mr. Long.  Unfortunately, several other 
		bullets have already struck Long]
-- It's the thought that counts, "The Mansion Family"

% Britney calls the "totally venerable" Chapman onstage.  He takes his
% award statue, and Britney kisses him on the cheek.  Chapman
% immediately clutches his chest, and dies.  Oops.  Nudging Chapman's
% body out of the way with his foot, Kent tries to figure out to whom
% the award should go.  He has those over 60 stand up.  Then, over 70,
% 80, 90, and finally 100.  Homer and Burns are the last two standing. 
% Marge tells the thirtysomething Homer to sit down, leaving Burns as
% Springfield's oldest living resident.
%
% Burns walks onstage.

Burns:	Gosh, this is all so sudden.  [Britney goes to plant a 
	kiss on him, but Burns jumps aside]  Don't give me the 
	kiss of death, you black widow!
Kent:	[pries the award from Mr. Chapman's hands] Boy, he didn't 
	want to let go of that.  [the audience laughs.  Kent hands 
	the award to Burns]
Burns:	See I, I, don't have a speech prepared but, uh, abra-
	cadaver!  [reaches into Chapman's coat pocket-and pulls 
	out a three-page speech]
	[reading from the speech] Thank you all so much.  I love 
	Springfield from cuddliest infant ... [grimaces and rifles 
	through the rest of the speech] puppies, patriotism, 
	bluebirds -- pffft!  I'm not reading this drivel.  [tosses 
	the speech aside] This speech is over.  [takes his award 
	and walks off to a smattering of applause]
-- "The Mansion Family"

% The awards have all been given out, but Homer is determined to walk
% away with *something.*  He leaves the show dragging a giant award
% that was once part of the set.
%
% The next day, Burns muses on his advancing years.

Burns:		Now that I'm the town's oldest man, I'm starting to 
		realize I'm not a young man anymore.  I'll have to 
		start taking better care of myself.  You know, I 
		haven't had a medicino check-up in ages.
Smithers:	Sir, you deserve the finest doctors in the world.  
		I'm taking you to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
Burns:		Very well, but I'll need someone to watch my house.  
		Who's that fellow who always screws up and creates 
		havoc?
Smithers:	Homer Simpson, sir?  [points Simpson out on the 
		video monitors.  True to his reputation, he takes a 
		saw to his safety console]
Burns:		Yes!  The way I see it, he's due for a good 
		performance!
-- And pigs are due to start flying, "The Mansion Family"

% As Burns gets ready to leave for Minnesota, he instructs Marge to
% call the fire department if the house catches fire.  "They're new,
% but they're good," he testifies.  Marge assures Burns and Smithers
% that the family will take good care of Burns' mansion.
%
% Inside, Homer, wearing a smoking jacket and top hat, slides down the
% banister.  Unable to stop at the end, he zooms off and smacks
% straight into a painting on the wall, lodging himself inside the
% frame.  Just then, Smithers pops back inside to get something he
% forgot.  Homer laughs sheepishly and gives him the thumbs-up.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time:  5:17]
%
% Marge marvels at Burns' master bedroom, which is the size of the
% Simpsons' entire house.  Homer demonstrates the auto-bed-making
% mechanism, which drops the old bed under the floor to be
% incinerated, while a new, identical bed falls from the ceiling. 
% "Wasteful *and* practical," he declares.
%
% Next, Homer tries out the mechanical dressing dealy, but it's
% evidently not adjusted for someone of his size.  After several
% seconds of painful-sounding gear noises, Homer emerges, a little 
% worse for the wear but ready to hit the town.
%
% Meanwhile, Bart sneaks down the hallway, looking behind the
% paintings on the wall as he goes.  Finally, he finds the wall-safe
% hidden behind one of the paintings.  Cracking the safe with the ease
% one doesn't see in the average ten-year-old nowadays, he opens the
% door, revealing a guard in a Beefeater-type costume.  The guard
% tells the startled boy to close the door, and Bart quickly does so.
%
% Lisa (with Maggie in her arms) checks out Burns' comprehensive
% collection of Nancy Drew books.  He even has the controversial "Clue
% in the Clock."  She picks the book off the shelf and flips through
% it.  "So many swears," Lisa muses to herself.
%
% Bart races a golf cart through the hall.

Bart:	[knocking over a table] I'm Al Unser, Jr.!
Lisa:	[following Bart on horseback, and jumping over the table]
	I'm Princess Margaret!
Homer:	[following Lisa on a riding mower] I'm drunk!
	[mows the table into little bits]
-- "The Mansion Family"

% Blissfully unaware of what's going on back home, Burns and Smithers
% sit in the waiting room of the Mayo Clinic.  A doctor and the Pope
% walk through the door.

Doctor:	It's nothing serious; just lay off the chili and you 
	should be fine.
Castro:	[sitting nearby, snickers]
Pope:	Don't you laugh, Fidel.  I've been in the car with you.
	[pan to Burns, who is filling out the admissions form]
Burns:	Let's see, social security number ... naught, naught, 
	naught ... naught, naught ... naught, naught, naught, two.  
	Damn Roosevelt.  [continuing to read] Cause of parents' 
	death ... got in my way.
-- Something hereditary, no doubt, "The Mansion Family"

% The family sits down to a simple dinner, served on a banquet table
% that can seat at least fifty people.

Lisa:	Mom!  Bart's making faces at me!  [looks through a pair of 
	opera glasses, but Bart is still a tiny figure in the 
	distance]  I think.
Homer:	Look how loud I have to yell!
Marge:	[looks at her place setting] This all seems a little 
	elaborate for sloppy joes.  Hmm, I know what the other 
	eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one.  
	[holds up a long, thin fork]
Homer:	[mock-sophisticate accent] Why, Marge, I believe you're 
	supposed to scratch your ass with it.
Marge:	Homer, watch your lang-- [tries the fork in the suggested 
	manner] Ohh, that's a life-saver.
-- Modern manners, "The Mansion Family"

% After dinner, the family retires to the drawing room.  Bart tries to
% smoke a cigar, but Marge snatches it away, telling him cigars are
% only for rich people and comedy legends.  Homer pours a glass of
% brandy and swirls it, spilling much of the glass' contents.  Marge
% accuses Homer of jimmying open Burns' liquor cabinet, which he
% deflects by saying "jimmy" is such an ugly word -- "unless you're
% talking about Jimmy Smits."
%
% Lisa tries to be the voice of reason.

Lisa:	But house-sitting is a sacred -- [she's splashed by some 
	errant brandy] Hey!
Marge:	Stop swirling, Homer!
Homer:	Listen, I worked long and hard for this place, and no 
	one's going to take it away from me.  Not you, not its 
	rightful owner, not anybody.  [gulps down the brandy] And 
	another thing, if I have ...
	[passes out, dropping the brandy glass.  It rolls until it 
	bumps Homer's head, making a pleasant clinking sound]
-- "The Mansion Family"

% Next morning, Homer makes a few phone calls from the sauna.

Homer:	Operator, get me Thailand.  T, I ... and so on.
Marge:	[walking in] Homer, who are you calling?
Homer:	Everybody!  I found Burnsie's address book.  I called the 
	New York Yankees and told them to bunt, then I called the 
	Queen of England and asked her how it was going!  And then 
	I --
Marge:	[interrupting] Well, don't run up Mr. Burns' phone bill.
Homer:	Just a second, Marge.  [on phone] Hello, Thailand?  How's 
	everything on your end?  Uh, huh.  That's some language 
	you got there.  And you talk like that 24/7, huh?
	[Marge takes the phone from him and hangs it up]
	Hey!
Marge:	Homer, you've got to stop pretending this is your house.  
	You're not a billionaire.
Homer:	Jeez, way to burst my bubble, Marge.
Marge:	All I'm saying is don't get too comfortable.  Mr. Burns 
	will be back tomorrow.
Homer:	Marge, you're right.  We *do* have to have a party.
Marge:	Party!?  No!  No parties!
Homer:	What about par-tay?
Marge:	No part-tays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no 
	mixers, no raves, no box socials.
Homer:	Damn!  And I looked so good on that bike!  [looks at a box 
	social invitation, which has a picture of him on an old-
	fashioned bicycle.  Marge takes it from him]
-- Box social pooper, "The Mansion Family"

% At the Mayo Clinic, Burns asks the doctor to test him for
% everything, gesturing to a chart entitled, "Diseases You Can Have."  
% The doctor starts by trying to draw a blood sample, but the
% syringe's needle pokes clean through Burns' arm.  Burns offers his
% other arm, since he saw some blood there the other day.
%
% Next, Burns is tested on a breath-endurance machines.  It's one of
% those contraptions where the patient blows into a tube of liquid to
% keep a ping-pong ball aloft.  After blowing for a few seconds,
% Burns' face is sucked twelve centimeters into the machine.  The
% nurse on duty deems this a good result.
%
% Burns is a bit too old for the stair-climber test, so the clinic
% uses an escalator test instead.  Burns rides up a short (perhaps two
% feet high) escalator, than takes a down-escalator back to where he
% started.
%
% Finally, Burns is put through a CAT-scan machine.  Unfortunately,
% his body jams in the mechanism, and a technician is called in to
% free him.
%
% While Burns is extricated from the scanner, Homer drives one of the
% old man's cars to Moe's Tavern.

Homer:	Having a party, Moe.  I'll need four kegs of your finest 
	imported-sounding beer.
Moe:	How 'bout Tuborg -- the beer of Danish kings.
Homer:	Mmmm ... danish.
Moe:	Now you know I can't sell you no beer until 2 p.m. on 
	account of it's Sunday.
Homer:	Huh?  If you can't sell beer what are Lenny and Carl doing 
	here?
Carl:	Huh?  Oh, we're just watching the sun move across the sky.
	[points to a sunbeam shining through the door window onto 
	the tavern floor.  A line labeled "Drinking Time" is 
	inscribed on the floor]
Lenny:	When it gets to here, [indicates the line] we can drink 
	again.
Homer:	But I need that beer now!
Moe:	Sorry, 2 p.m.  Or you can steal a boat and sail out to 
	international waters, heh.
Homer:	What's that, a theme park?
Moe:	No, the ocean.  Once you get twelve miles out, there's no 
	laws at all.  That's where they held the Tyson-Secretariat 
	fight.  [indicates a souvenir poster from that bout]
Homer:	[laughs] They were so drunk.  Gentlemen, get off your 
	knees.  Your rich uncle Homer is throwing the wildest box 
	social the high seas have ever seen!  [leaves]
	[opens door and pokes head back in]
	And you're invited.
	[bar patrons cheer]
-- Oh, *now* you say so, "The Mansion Family"

% Marge somehow gets wind of the plan and tries to stop Homer and his
% party posse from boarding the yacht.  Homer says it's now or never
% for the party, since he may never be rich for real.  Marge starts to
% say something doubtlessly touching about how she'll always love her
% husband, but she's interrupted when Lenny announces he found another
% way onto the boat.  The partygoers stream up the gangplank, leaving
% Marge alone on the dock.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  11:39]
%
% Cap'n Homer gives the command to set sail.  Lisa tries to reassure
% her mother, but Marge can't help but notice that the boat is leaving
% the dock sideways.  A well-placed jetty knocks the vessel into the
% proper orientation, and the party boat is on its way.

Carl:	Homer, have we hit international waters yet?  Because, eh, 
	things are gettin' real ugly.
	[cut to Moe, who stands in front of a keg of beer, holding 
	off the advancing crowd with a bullwhip]
Moe:	I can't sell you beer until we cross the line!
Barney:	Legally, you can give us free beer.
	[Moe whips him] Ow!
-- Or maybe not, "The Mansion Family"

% Lenny asks Moe for some rubbing alcohol, and Moe tosses him a
% bottle.  When he tries to drink it, Moe whips the bottle out of his
% hands.
%
% Finally, the yacht crosses the line.

We made it son.  International waters -- the land that law forgot!
-- Homer Simpson, "The Mansion Family"

% Homer is not the only one taking advantage of the high sea's lax
% legal standards.  On one yacht, a bevy of bikini-clad women dance to
% the latest tunes.  Cowboys on another vessel brawl like they were in
% a wild, wild Western movie.  On another boat, a live bullfight takes
% place.  Bart is impressed.

Bart:	Wow, you can do anything out here!
Homer:	That's right.  See that ship over there?  [points to a 
	ship with a large satellite dish on it] They're re-
	broadcasting Major League Baseball with implied oral 
	consent, not express written consent -- or so the legend 
	goes.
-- "The Mansion Family"

% On yet another ship, Cap'n McAllister marries a man and a cow. 
% After the cow breaks the ritual wedding glass (hey, at least the
% man's marrying a kosher animal), the Cap'n presents the wedded
% couple with a basket of illegal fireworks.
%
% Back on Burns' yacht, Homer exults, "There are no laws!  We can do
% anything we want -- anything!"  Lenny kicks him in the shins, and
% Homer berates his lack of maturity.  (Lenny's, that is, not Homer's
% own.)
%
% At the Mayo Clinic, Burns receives the results of his tests.

Burns:	Well, doc, I think I did pretty well on my tests.  You may 
	shake my hand if you like.
Doctor:	Well, under the circumstances, I'd rather not.
Burns:	Eh?
Doctor:	Mr. Burns, I'm afraid you are the sickest man in the 
	United States.  You have everything.
Burns:	You mean I have pneumonia?
Doctor:	Yes.
Burns:	Juvenile diabetes?
Doctor:	Yes.
Burns:	Hysterical pregnancy?
Doctor:	Uh, a little bit, yes.  You also have several diseases 
	that have just been discovered -- in you.
Burns:	I see.  You sure you haven't just made thousands of 
	mistakes?
Doctor:	Uh, no, no, I'm afraid not.
Burns:	This sounds like bad news.
Doctor:	Well, you'd think so, but all of your diseases are in 
	perfect balance.  Uh, if you have a moment, I can explain.
Burns:	Well ... [looks at his watch]
	[the Doctor puts a tiny model house door on his desk]
Doctor:	Here's the door to your body, see?  [bring up some small 
	fuzz balls with goofy faces and limbs from under the desk]  
	And these are oversized novelty germs.  [points to a 
	different one up as he names each disease] That's 
	influenza, that's bronchitis, [holds up one] and this cute 
	little cuddle-bug is pancreatic cancer.  Here's what 
	happens when they all try to get through the door at once.  
	[tries to cram a bunch through the model door.  The 
	"germs" get stuck]
	[Stooge-like] Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!  Move it,

	[normal voice] We call it, "Three Stooges Syndrome."
Burns:	So what you're saying is, I'm indestructible!
Doctor:	Oh, no, no, in fact, even slight breeze could --
Burns:	Indestructible.
-- Diagnosis:  Indestructible, "The Mansion Family"

% Marge and Lisa busily clean the house, upholding the sacred bond to
% keep the place exactly as Burns left it.  They even scrub down a
% laboratory, even though the family was never in there.  Several jars
% in the lab contain homunculi that resemble Burns and Smithers. 
% Unfazed, Marge cleans a spot of dirt from one of the jars.
%
% The party rolls on full blast in international waters.  Homer
% considers the lives of those back on land, smugly noting they are
% unaware of "the simple joys of a monkey knife fight."  (One of which
% is taking place on the yacht at that very moment.)
%
% Bart teases a Coast Guard cutter holding position just inside United

	[the other guests join in]
Crowd:	You are!
-- Party on, Homer, "The Mansion Family"

% Homer's bash soon draws unwanted attention from pirates.  Peering 
through a spyglass, he sees the party on Burns' boat.

Mate:		[collapsing the spyglass] Looks like another 
		homosexual party boat.  They always have such nice 
		things.
Captain:	Perhaps we should pay them a visit.
Mate:		A deadly visit?
Captain:	Well, let's play it by ear.
-- "The Mansion Family"

% Unaware of the danger, Homer keeps dancing on the deck of the yacht. 
% He momentarily dances away from the crowd, and then back toward
% them.  In this brief span of time, his party guests are replaced by
% the menacing pirates.  Homer tries his away-and-back move once more,
% but the pirates are still there.
%
% Homer asks the captain if they are friendly pirates; needless to
% say, they are not.  Underscoring this point, Homer's guests are
% trapped in a net suspended ten or twenty feet above the deck.  The
% pirates probe the net with sticks, releasing coins, wallets, and
% Moe's bus pass.
%
% The captain sets a course for "Hidden Pirate Island," which is also
% called "Hong Kong."  Homer desperately calls the Coast Guard for
% assistance.

Homer:	Help!  Pirates!
Coast
 Guard:	Navy SEALs are on the way.
Homer:	Oh, bless you.

 Guard:	How about a tactical nuclear strike?
Homer:	Oh, that would be just ... [realizes] oh, you're just

 Guard:	Perhaps this foghorn will answer your question.  [foghorn 
	makes the "mwah-mwaaaah" sound]
-- "The Mansion Family"

% The pirates order Homer into the net.  He refuses and fights the
% captain, knocking off all four of the parrots riding the pirate's
% shoulders.  Grabbing a knife from one of the fighting monkeys in one
% hand, Homer climbs a ladder and reaches for a rope.  He tries to
% swing down to the weather deck, but rope burns make him lose his
% grip.  He crashes on the deck and suddenly gets charley horse. 
% Clasping the knife in his mouth, he massages his calf.  The knife
% cuts his lips, and when Homer lets go of it, it sticks in his left
% hand.  Surrounded, Homer concedes defeat, and winds up in the net
% with the other guests.
%
% The pirates have moved the net, so that it is now suspended over the
% ocean.

Lenny:		Some party, Homer.
Homer:		Shut up, Net Face.
Lenny:		Hey, you're in the net, too.
Homer:		I said, shut up, Net Face!
Moe:		Aw, we're going to die and I never tasted 
		cantaloupe.
Krusty:		Eh, you didn't miss much.  Honeydew is the money
