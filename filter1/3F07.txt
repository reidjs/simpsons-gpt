 Bart: Oh, hey!  That's Mom.  She's happy again!
        [runs to the yard]
        [perturbed] You guys made a snowman family?
Homer: Check it out, boy: it's like looking into a living snow mirror.
        [snow Homer has hair and large muscles]
 Bart: Why didn't you wait for me?
Marge: I didn't think you'd mind.  I figured you were getting a little
       too old for this.  But you can still make one: there's some snow
       left under the car.
        [said snow is all dirty and disgusting]
-- Thanks a lot, Mom, "Marge Be Not Proud"

% Bart reaches under the car and scoops out some of the dirty snow.  He
% fashions a grey, ugly version of himself with twigs for arms and puts
% it next to the rest of the snow Simpsons.  Inside, he sees the rest of
% his family watching TV.  A bird lands on the corner of snow Bart and
% flies off as it crumbles.

  Bart: [muttering] Stupid family.
Nelson: Hey, Simpson, look what I swiped from Try-N-Save: it's a
        replacement tire for a wheelbarrow.
  Bart: Huh?
Nelson: I knew _you'd_ like it.  [laughs, walks off]
-- Irony, not lost on Nelson, "Marge Be Not Proud"

% Bart rues, "Everyone thinks I'm the black sheep.  Well, I'll show 'em
% what a black sheep can do!"  He shakes his fist at the clouds and
% walks into the Try-N-Save.

 Lisa: [spraying the Christmas tree] Mom, this fake snow is making me
       dizzy.
Marge: We're almost finished.  There's just a little bit of green left.
        [Lisa drops the can and looks catatonic]
        [Bart walks in]
Marge: There you are.  You can help me spray the cookies!
        [Bart looks at her] Are you hiding something?  What do you have
       under your jacket?
 Bart: Nothing!
Marge: Oh, Bart, not again.  Give it to me!
 Bart: I told you, I don't have anything!  [runs off]
Marge: You can't hide from me in this house, Bart.  I spend 23 hours a
       day here.
Homer: [blocking a door] Hee hee hee.  Get 'im, Ma.
-- Homer, country bumpkin, "Marge Be Not Proud"

Marge: There's no place left to run, Bart.  Hand it over.
        [he gives her a picture in a frame]
       Oh, Bart: I can't believe you did this.
        [the picture is Bart smiling; a receipt says "Paid in full"]
 Bart: I wanted to surprise you for Christmas.
Marge: Oh, sweetie, this is the best present a mother could get.
        [showers Bart with kisses] I love you so much, my little bitty
       Barty.
 Bart: [bashful] Mom...
-- All's well, "Marge Be Not Proud"

% Marge puts the new picture atop the old picture, blocking out Bart in
% the old picture.

Marge: Since I got my present early, I think you should get yours early
       too!
 Lisa: Bart got a present early?  Then I should get a present early!  I
       want a present.
Marge: Lisa, you have to wait.
 Lisa: [mutters] This is the worst Christmas ever.
Marge: Now I know you love video games, and I asked the clerk which is
       the one every boy wants --
 Bart: [opening it] [gasps] You got me --
