Milhouse: The only decent new one is "Radiation Dude".
    Bart: Nah, he's just a cheap imitation of Radioactive Man.
Milhouse: [put out] Explain.
    Bart: The similarities are subtle, but many.  For example,
          Radioactive Man has his famous catch phrase, "Up and at 'em!"
          with "at 'em" spelled A-T-O-M in a delicious pun.
Milhouse: Go on...
    Bart: While Radiation Dude has a similar but lamer catch phrase, "Up
          and let's go!"

Wiggum: Well, they'll -- when they find him, they'll, um -- [mumbles
        something incomprehensible]
Mr. VH: Uh, excuse me: you didn't answer me.  You just trailed off.
Wiggum: Yeah...yeah, I did kind of trail off, there, didn't I?  Heh.
-- Evading the honest answer, "Radioactive Man"

% Bart figures he can find Milhouse by checking all his old haunts.  He
% walks into Slot Car Heaven to find Otto and the comic store guy racing
% slot cars.

 Bart: Have you seen Milhouse?
Owner: No, now go away: we're racing for the title of the champion of
       the universe.
        [Otto's school bus crashes]
 Otto: All right!
-- A day at the slot car races, "Radioactive Man"

% Bart checks the decrepit old Spirograph[tm] factory.  A lone man plays
% with a Spirograph on a slanted desk.

 Bart: Yo, Dr. S: have you seen Milhouse today?
Dr. S: No.
 Bart: OK, thanks.  [starts to leave]
Dr. S: Wait: did you know that there's a direct correlation between the
       decline of Spirograph and the rise in gang activity?  Think about
       it.
 Bart: I will.  [walks off]
Dr. S: No you won't.  [goes back to drawing]

% "The only place left is the treehouse," reasons Bart.  The camera pans
% to each of the corners, finally stopping on Milhouse on the sixth
% corner.

    Bart: Aha!
Milhouse: Stay away from me, Bart.  I mean it: I'm not going back.  I'm
          not cut out to be a star.
    Bart: But Milhouse, being a star is every patriotic American's
          dream.
Milhouse: Not mine.  It's a sham, Bart!  You get up on that movie screen
          pretending to be a hero, but you're not.  The real heroes are
          out _there_, toiling day and night on more important things!
    Bart: [dreamy] Television.
Milhouse: No!  Curing heart disease and wiping out world hunger.
    Bart: But Milhouse, they haven't cured anything!  Heart disease and
          world hunger are still rampant.  Those do-gooders are all a
          bunch a pitiful losers...every last one of them.  Want
          results?  You have to go to the Schwarzeneggers, the
          Stallones, and to a lesser extent, the Van Dammes.
-- Bart mounts the soapbox, "Radioactive Man"

% A helicopter with a rope ladder and someone on it flies towards the
% treehouse.  A man jumps off the rope ladder into the treehouse and
% smiles at the boys.

    Boys: [gasp] Mickey Rooney!
  Rooney: Hi, Milhouse.  The studio sent me to talk to you, being a
          former child star myself, _and_ the number one box office draw
          from 1939 to 1940.
    Bart: Wow, spanning two decades.
Milhouse: How'd you find us?
  Rooney: Uh, they tapped your treehouse phone.
           [shot of a pair of cans with a wire going to a van]
-- The latest technology, "Radioactive Man"

   Rooney: Milhouse, listen: you can't quit this movie.  I've seen your
           work; it's good -- very, very good.  Van Johnson good.
 Milhouse: I know I'm good.  Movie stardom is just so hollow.
   Rooney: Hollow?!  The only thing in show business that's hollow is
           the music industry.  Come on, Milhouse, you _have_ to do
           this, if not for yourself, then for the moviegoing public and
           for the foreign markets that are more important than ever
           nowadays and...finally, for me -- the Mickster.
 Milhouse: [adamant] No.
   Rooney: All right, I tried.  Fortunately, we have a perfectly good
           Fallout Boy right here.  [puts his arm around Bart]
            [next shot shows Rooney in Fallout Boy costume]
   Rooney: Jiminy jillikers.  Jiminy jillikers.  Jiminy jillikers!
 Director: [covering his eyes] We're shutting down production.
Assistant: Yeah, well, we only have $1000 left anyway.
   Quimby: Uh, there's a $1000 leaving town tax.
-- Good to the last milked drop, "Radioactive Man"

% The town gathers to see the movie folk off.

Rooney: Well, I hope you're all satisfied.  You bankrupted a bunch of
        naive movie folks -- folks from a Hollywood where values are...
        different.  They weren't thinking about the money.  They just
        wanted to tell a story, a story about a radioactive man, and you
        slick small-towners took 'em for all they were worth.
         [everyone looks dejected and mournful]
  Otto: [sniffles] Do we give them some of their money back?
Quimby: [weeps] No.
         [the helicopter swings by overhead]
 Pilot: Hurry, Mr. Rooney!  We've got a disenchanted little girl in a
        Jell-O Pudding commercial!
Rooney: I could play that...[grabs the rope ladder]
-- Always looking out for numero uno, "Radioactive Man"

% In class, Mrs. Krabappel drones on in front of a map of the world.

  Bart: So, Milhouse, it must be a little tough giving up all that
        glamor and coming back to school, huh?
Midget: Quiet!  Maybe I can get my citizenship.
-- All's well, "Radioactive Man"

% In Hollywood, an assembled crowd welcomes back the troubled production
% with open arms.  An actor hugs the assistant and says, "We know you
% don't have any more money left, but that doesn't matter.  Just take
% whatever you need from our boutiques until you can get back on your
% feet."  The assistant sighs, "Thank God we're back in Hollywood where
% people treat each other right."
