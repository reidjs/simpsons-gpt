Homer:		Area code?  But it's a local call!
Marge:		The phone company ran out of numbers, so they split

		the old 636 area code, and our half gets 939.
Homer:		939!?  What the hell is that!?  Oh, my life is 
		ruined.
Marge:		Jeez, you just have to remember three extra numbers.

	his other hand, which has "Lenny = white, Carl = black" 
	written on it] Is that right?
	Don't you miss the old 636 ... [consults hand] ... Carl?
Carl:	I'm not sure which one's better.  The "6" is closer to the 
	"3", so you got convenience there, but the "9" has less to 
	do with Satan, which is a plus in this religious world of 
	ours.
Homer:	What really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of 
	warning.
Carl:	What do you mean?  They ran those TV commercials about it, 
	and that big radio campaign.
Lenny:	Don't forget the leaflets they dropped from the Space
