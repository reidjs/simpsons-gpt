-- Homer watches `Eye on Springfield', ``Flaming Moe's''

Tonight, we salute the silver anniversary of the Great Springfield Tire Yard
Fire.  Twenty-five years, and still burning strong!
-- Kent Brockman hosts `Eye on Springfield', ``Flaming Moe's''

Kent:  We'll watch Springfield's oldest man meet Springfield's fattest man.
       [caption reads, ``Opposites attract?'']
Homer: He's not so fat.
-- Kent Brockman hosts `Eye on Springfield', ``Flaming Moe's''

Kent:  And we visit with heavyweight champion Dreaderick Tatum, who
       reminisces about growing up in Springfield.
Tatum: That town is a dump.  If you ever see me back there,
       you'll know I really [bleep]ed up bad.
-- A candid interview, ``Flaming Moe's''

But first!  Part seven of our eye-opening look at the bikini!
-- Kent Brockman hosts `Eye on Springfield', ``Flaming Moe's''

% Whence follows another shameless montage of scantily-clad women.

Whoa!  T and A!
-- Bart catches a glimpse of `Eye on Springfield's story on bikinis,
   ``Flaming Moe's''

% Homer asks Bart why he's still up, and (after we hear giggling from
% Lisa's slumber party upstairs) Bart explains, ``Who can sleep with
% those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me!''  Scoffs Homer,
% ``What an ego.''
%
% The girls giggle about Bart, then play the candle-wax game.

Janey: Now remember, Wanda, whatever shape the wax takes, that's what
       your husband's job will be.
Wanda: [disappointed] It's a mop.  My husband will be a janitor.
Lisa:  That looks like an Olympic torch to me.  Your husband could be
       an Olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career!
Wanda: [lets another drop of wax fall]  It's a dustpan.
Lisa:  The wax never lies...
-- Lisa's slumber party, ``Flaming Moe's''

% The girls then play Truth or Dare.  Susan (wearing braces) is dared to
% kiss Bart.  In the kitchen, an unsuspecting Bart gets smooched by Susan.
% Bart threatens, ``I'm telling Mom and Dad,'' and the girls place the
% say-it-at-the-same-time jinx on him.  (``You can't talk 'til somebody

-- Kent Brockman hosts `Eye on Springfield', ``Flaming Moe's''

Homer: What is it, boy?
Bart:  Mmph.  Mmph.  Mmph.
Homer: Is anything the matter, my son?  Talk to me, young man.
Bart:  [takes a pad and writes, `Say my name'.]
Homer: Say your name?  Why should I do that, my lad?
Bart:  Because I'm jinxed, dammit!
Homer: [punches Bart in the arm]
Bart:  Ow!  What was that for!?
Homer: You spoke while you were jinxed, so I get to punch you in the arm!

-- A kid at heart, ``Flaming Moe's''

% The girls spot Bart (``Let's give him a make-over!'') and chase him

%
% Homer goes to Moe's Tavern, which is empty save one other customer.

Homer: What's the matter, Moe?

       would even use the cigarette machine.
-- ``Flaming Moe's''

Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a
purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.
-- Moe, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Homer asks for a beer, but the taps are dry.  Moe fell behind on his
% beer payments, spending his last $10,000 on the Love Tester (a coin-operated
% gizmo).  Homer tries to suck the last few drops of beer from the taps,
% but Moe tells him Barney did that already.  (``Cut his gums up pretty
% bad.'')  Moe reassures Homer that he learned how to make other drinks
% at bartender's school, blowing an inch of dust off a Cocktail Chart.

Gin and... tonic?  [in disbelief] Do they mix?
-- Moe dusts off his chart of drink recipes, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Homer tells Moe of a drink he invented.  Flashback time.  One night,
% he was suffering through yet another of Patty and Selma's slide shows.

Selma: [showing slides]  And this is Patty trying to plug her leg razor
       into one of those ungodly Czechoslovakian outlets.
       [next slide, of a hairy-legged Patty]  As you can see, we never
       did get the hang of it.
Bart:  Aye, carumba!
-- ``Flaming Moe's''

% ``As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink.''
% Homer heads into the kitchen for a Duff, but since Selma took the last one,
% he has to improvise.

I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
In my haste, I had grabbed a bottle of the kid's cough syrup.
[mixes them in the blender, pours a glass, gulps it down]
[waves his hand in front of his face]
It passed the first test:  I didn't go blind.
-- Homer creates a new drink, ``Flaming Moe's''

% The slide show continues.  An ash from Selma's cigarette ignites Homer's
% drink.

I don't know the scientific explanation, but FIRE MADE IT GOOD.
-- Homer creates a new drink, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Moe invites Homer to make a `Flaming Homer'.  Homer needs cough syrup,
% and Moe goes through the lost-and-found.  He turns up some cough syrup.
% It's rather bland, but after you light it...

Wow, Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everybody's invited!
-- Moe tastes a Flaming Homer, ``Flaming Moe's''

% A customer complains about the Love Tester (``I want my nickel back'') and
% Moe gives him a Flaming Homer.

Hey, this drink is delicious.  And my phlegm feels looser!
-- Snake oil not included, ``Flaming Moe's''

% The customer asks what it's called.  Homer explains, ``It's called
% a Flaming...''  Moe quickly interrupts, ``Moe.  It's called a Flaming
% Moe.  That's right, a Flaming Moe.  My name is Moe, and I invented it.
% That's why it's called a Flaming Moe.  What, what are you looking at

%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 7:00]
%
% Moe's Tavern is packed with customers, all drinking Flaming Moe's.

Barney: [discovers the salad bar]  Hey, what's this?
Moe:    A sneeze guard.
Barney: [sneezes, spewing snot all over the sneeze guard] Wow, it really works!
-- An ounce of prevention, ``Flaming Moe's''

Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down
on you for accepting food stamps.
-- Homer, ``Flaming Moe's''

% It's clear the it's the Flaming Moe that is drawing the customers.
% A pretty woman applies for the waitress position and gets it (after
% some lascivious comments from Moe and an insulting rejoinder).
% ``You shan't regret this.''  Harv Bannister from Tipsy McStagger's
% Good-Time Drinking and Eating Emporium offers to buy the recipe.
% (Moe doesn't quite understand that `Tipsy McStagger' is merely the
% name of the company; he thinks there really is a Mr. McStagger.)

The Flaming Moe is not for sale.  Do you know how much of my blood
and sweat are in this drink?
[everybody in the bar spits out their drink]
Uh, figure of speech.
-- Moe refuses to sell out, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Mr. Bannister surreptitiously pours a Flaming Moe into a container for
% future analysis.  Barney is pleased.  ``Good for you, Moe.  Only an

% pleased.  At school...

Martin: So the next time you use a gas chromatograph, remember to thank
        Mr. A. J. P. Martin.
Ms. K:  [applauding]  Oh, brilliant, Martin, brilliant!  Once again, you've
        wrecked the grading curve.  Oh, I pity the poor student who has
        to follow you.  [consults her sheet]  Bart Simpson, you're next.
-- ``Inventors We Admire'' day, ``Flaming Moe's''

The Inventor I Admire, by Bart Simpson.
The inventor I admire is not a rich man or a famous man or even a smart

% Bart proclaims that Homer invented the Flaming Homer, but everybody
% knows that Moe invented it.

Bart: My father invented that drink, and if you'll allow me to demonstrate...
      [pulls out of brown paper bag a blender and bottles of liquor]
Ms.K: Bart, are those liquor bottles?
Bart: [as if this excused it] I brought enough for everybody.
Ms.K: Take those to the teachers' lounge!  You can have what's left at the

-- ``Inventors We Admire'' day, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Moe erects a neon `Flaming Moe's' sign atop his tavern, and Flaming Moe's

% Bart eats dinner shirtless.  Marge suggests Homer talk to Moe.  Homer
% refuses.  Too upset to eat, he decides to go to Moe's.  (``D'oh!'')
% But he can't get past the bouncer.  Inside Moe introduces his new friends.

Moe:       How about a warm Flaming Moe's welcome for... Aerosmith!
Aerosmith: Nah, I don't think so Moe, we're just hanging out, etc.
Moe:       C'mon guys, free pickled eggs!
Aerosmith: Awright!  Yeah!  [head onstage]

Bart: [surprised]  Uh, hi.
Hugh: Who's this?
Bart: Bart Simpson.
Hugh: Well, what can I do for you, Bart?
Bart: Uh, look, I'll level with you, Mister.  This is a crank call that

Hugh: All right.  Better luck next time. [hangs up]  What a nice young man.
