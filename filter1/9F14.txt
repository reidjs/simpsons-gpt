% his map: "To remove the spider's curse, simply quote a Bible verse."
% But he is stuck at "Thou shalt not..." and simply throws a rock at
% it, knocking it out, and leaps out the window.  Outside the plant,
% Barney waits for Homer in his car.  There is a mattress tied to the

         judgment here.
  Homer: The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the
         football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
Lovejoy: I cast thee out!
-- You remember Matthew 21:17, "Duffless"

% Homer rides along on Lisa's bike, trying not to think about beer.
% He sees a Duff billboard of a scantily clad woman next to a beer
% bottle ("You know you want it") and Homer turns sharply to avoid
% looking at it.  He stops at a railroad crossing, where he sees that
% the train rolling past is carrying several boxcars' worth of Duff.
% The wheels even seem to be saying "Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-
% lug"...  Homer turns away from the railroad and bikes straight into
% an empty can of Duff which sends him off his bike looking skyward.
% A zeppelin flies overhead, with a marquee reading "Surrender to Duff"
% and releases a payload of Duff Bottles. "Nooo!!!!"
%
% Despite all of that, he makes it.  Shuddering, Homer crosses off the
% last day of the month.

Homer: Thirty days.
Marge: I'm proud of you, Homey.
Homer: Marge, I'm going to Moe's.  Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm
       coming back loaded.  [kisses Marge good-bye]
-- "Duffless"

Marge: Mmmm.  You don't have to start drinking right away.  I waas
       thinking we could go for a bike ride.
Homer: But Marge, the barflies are expecting me.  Larry, and Barney,
       and that guy who calls me Bill.
Marge: But you look better, you don't sweat when you eat any more, and
       look -- [holds up a wad of cash] you've saved more than a
       hundred dollars.  I found it in your pants.
Homer: [snatches money] Yoink!
Marge: Mmmm.
-- "Duffless"

% Homer arrives at Moe's.

     Moe: Well, well.  Look who it is, Mr. "I Don't Need Alky-hol to
          Enjoy Life."  We hate him, right fellas?
Barflies: [grumble]
   Homer: Moe, give me a beer.
     Moe: Hey everybody, Homer's back.
Barflies: [grumbles]
-- Who cares?, "Duffless"

% Moe pours Homer a glass of that wonderful Duff.  Homer lifts it to
% his lips, but hesitates to drink it.  He eyes the poor, pathetic
% barflies around him: Larry, Smitty (collapsed), and Barney (who
% burps).  Then he looks at Moe.

   Moe: C'mon, Homer, do it for your old pal Moesy.
Barney: But Moe, yesterday you called Homer a worthless sack of --
   Moe: [strikes Barney] Pipe down, rub-a-dub!
-- Moe pushes Homer to get back to alkyholism, "Duffless"

 Homer: [setting the glass on the bar] Put it in the fridge Moe, I got
        a date with my wife.
   Moe: You'll be back!  [points at various customers] And so will you.
        And you.  [points at camera] And you.
         [he points at Barney]
Barney: Of course I'll be back.  If you didn't close, I'd never leave.
-- Moe fails to get Homer back to alkyholism, "Duffless"

% Homer and Marge go on that bike ride, after all.  They sing along to
% "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" as they bike into the sunset.

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21'11" {19'55"}]

% Instead of the usual closing theme music, "Raindrops Keep Falling on
% My Head" (as sung by Kipp Lennon) keeps playing.

      (instrumental continues for ~10 seconds)
     
     It won't be long before happiness steps up to greet me
       . . .
     Raindrops keep falling on my head
     But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
     Crying's not for me, 'cause
     I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
     Because I'm free, nothing's worrying me.

% The sound effect for the Gracie Films logo is replaced by a bicycle
% bell being rung twice, followed by Homer giggling.
