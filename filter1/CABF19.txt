% Thunder crashes at Mr. Burns' manor.  Mr. Burns calls out a window.

Hurry, Smithers!  Halloween is upon us!  Put up the decoration.  [chuckles
mischievously]
--Mr. Burns, Treehouse of Horror XII

% On the ledge outside the window, a ladder is propped up on a nearby tower.
% At the top is Smithers, hanging a small orange plastic bat on the side of a
% weather vane.  

No, no!  That won't scare anybody!  On the top!
--Mr. Burns, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Smithers struggles to reach the pointed tip of the weather vane.  Just as
% he gets the decoration up, the ladder slips and Smithers falls off 
% backwards.  He slides down a nearby power line towards the next tower, and
% hits a box labeled "High Voltage".  He's electrocuted, the box explodes, and
% the tower breaks in half.  The top of the tower falls onto Mr. Burns'
% mausoleum.  Four caskets fly out, slide upright onto pillars of the mansion,
% and open up.
%
% The Simpsons, dressed in costumes, walk towards the manor.  Bart and Lisa
% complain that Flanders gave them mini toothpaste.  Then they all notice the
% building and dead bodies on fire.  Terrified, they run out the gate.  As the
% gate is closed, they get sliced by the bars.  Still screaming, the slices of
% Simpsons continue running away.
%
% At the top of the ladder, Mr. Burns delights in the terror he's induced.

Splendid, Batsy.  You've done it again!
--Mr. Burns, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Mr. Burns pats the bat decoration.  It comes to life and flies into the

% In the first segment, "hex and the city", the Simpsons sans Maggie visit 
% Ethnictown.

Homer: Ah, Ethnictown -- where hard-working immigrants dream of becoming lazy,
       overfed Americans.
Marge: Oh, listen, you can hear the beautiful ethnic serenade!
Man 1: [calling:] Apples!  I got apples!
Woman: [calling:] Cholera!  I got cholera!  [hacking cough]
Man 2: [calling:] Babies!  Who wants a-babies?
Homer: [takes a bundle] Wait, this is just a shaved puppy.
Man 2: I can see you know babies.
--The Ethnictown marketplace, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Bart, Marge, and Lisa go into a fortuneteller's shop.  They meet an old
% gypsy woman.

Gypsy: I sense you have a million questions.  But I, too, have one --
       [accusing tone:] are you a cop?
Marge: No.
Gypsy: 'Cause you gotta tell me if you are.
Marge: I'm not a cop.
Gypsy: Okay.  [waving her hands around a crystal ball] I sense you live with
       much misery.
Homer: [runs in with a "birthday boy" balloon and chortles] The perfect crime!
       Marge, I have to be in court next Tuesday.
Gypsy: I sense I should not take ... a check.
Homer: A fortuneteller?!  Oh, no you don't.  This phony gypsy just wants to
       rip you off.  See?  This wart is a fake!  [he tries to pull off the
       wart on her nose, but can't; his thumb instantly sprouts several warts]
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% The fortuneteller orders him to leave.  On his way out the door, Homer is
% freaked out by the beads hanging there.  He flails about and bumps into a
% candelabra.  His shirt catches fire and the sprinklers are set off.  Homer
% puts out the fire by rolling on the floor.  The sprinklers unshrink three
% shrunken heads on a table.  The heads look around, puzzled.

Head 2: Wait a minute, this isn't Cedars Sinai!
Gypsy:  You've ruined me!  Oh, why didn't I see this coming?!
          [Apparently, she failed to look down at the two tarot cards
           on her desk: "The Flaming Jerk" and "The Ruined Gypsy"]
        You stupid, stupid man!  I curse you!  You will bring bad luck to
        everyone you love!
Homer:  Whatever.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% That night, in bed, Marge worries that the gypsy's curse will cause horrible
% things to happen to the family.  Homer thinks she's coming on to him.  She's
% not, though.
%
% The next day, Marge greets the family at the breakfast table, sporting a new
% beard and moustache.  The family screams.

Marge: Mmm ... so it *is* noticeable.
Lisa:  What happened?
Marge: I don't know; I woke up like this.
Bart:  Oh, cool!  You could be in a freak show!
Homer: Don't talk to the bearded lady like that, you little ... !  
        [Homer strangles Bart, and Bart's neck stretches longer and longer.  
         When Homer lets go, Bart's head tips over backwards over the back of
         his chair.]
Marge: Gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens.
Homer: Oh, he's fine -- it's just a growth spurt.  [he coils Bart's neck] Good
       as new!
         [Bart's head keeps tipping, so Homer keeps rebalancing it.]
       There!  Right as rain!
         [Bart's head tips over onto the table.]
Marge: Homer, it's that evil gypsy's curse.  We're all being punished because
       *you* trashed her office.
Homer: Marge, that "curse" is just a lot of silly superstition.  Right, Lisa?
Lisa:  [stomps one of her new horse's hooves twice]
Homer: See?  Two means "yes".
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% At the bar, Moe suggests Homer use a leprechaun to get rid of the curse.

Homer: Leprechaun?  Don't they live in Ireland?
Moe:   Yeah, but they come over here in the wheel wells of Aer Lingus jets.
Carl:  You know, I was hexed by a troll, and a leprechaun cured that right up.
Lenny: Hey, you know what's even better is Jesus.  He's like six leprechauns.
Carl:  Yeah, but a lot harder to catch.  Go with a leprechaun.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% After Homer insists again his state of uncursedness, a helicopter crashes
% through the ceiling onto Lenny and Carl.  Lenny insists on dying first so he
% doesn't have to see Carl die.  Carl's fine with that so long as Lenny
% hurries.  They both die.  Homer is remorseful over their death ... and
% then he notices that Moe is in the pickled egg jar.
%
% In the woods at night, Homer and Bart dig a hole to trap a leprechaun.  The
% bait of choice is Lucky Charms cereal.  Homer pours cereal into the hole,
% but after several rabbits jump in, he realizes he used Trix cereal.  He gets
% a box of the correct cereal from a grocery bag and pours it into the hole
% ... and his mouth.
%
% Morning comes, and Bart and Homer check what they've caught.  Bart pulls out
% various creatures.

Bart:       Okay, let's see ... nymph, fairy, pixie, goblin--
Hobgoblin:  That's *hob*goblin.
Bart:       Sorry.  Nymph, nyad, wood sprite, Katie Couric, and ... bingo!
Homer:      [takes the leprechaun from Bart] Up!  Let's make sure he's a
            leprechaun.  Sing us a song of the Emerald Isle.
Leprechaun: [angrily jabbers in an Irish accent]
Homer:      [Irish accent:] Ah, 'tis like the singing of the angels
            themselves.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% The Simpsons eat breakfast at the kitchen table.  A very normal Homer eats
% pancakes.  Bart, with his head resting on the table, eats toast.  Satyric
% Lisa eats oatmeal.  Maggie the ladybug sucks on a bottle.  Marge, now 
% completely covered with hair, also eats pancakes, but is interrupted when
% the leprechaun knocks over her juice and stomps on her pancakes.

Marge: Homer, catching that leprechaun didn't help anything!
Lisa:  Maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.
Homer: Good idea, Mr. Ed.  Wanna come along, Noodle Neck?
Bart:  [struggles to lift his head] Can't live this way anymore ...  
         [Bart's head falls in his cereal.  The leprechaun comes over and
          dances on his head.]
-- Another breakfast for the Simpsons, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Back at the fortuneteller's office, the gypsy blow-dries the three heads to
% get them shrunken again.  She cackles when she sees Homer in the doorway.

Gypsy: Ah, the curséd one.  How's that curse I cursed you with, Cursedy, hmm?
Homer: I know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge ... Irish
       style!
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Homer opens the gate on a pet carrier.  The leprechaun is inside, sleeping.
% Homer pounds on the cage, and the leprechaun lunges out and onto the
% fortuneteller's head.  The two do battle, rolling around on the floor, but
% somehow the slapping gives way to kissing.

Leprechaun: Hold me close!  [kiss] Kiss me, I'm Irish.  [kiss]
Homer:      Eew, nasty!
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Homer and Marge attend the wedding between the gypsy and the leprechaun.

Kodos:      [crying] I always secrete ocular fluid at weddings.
Kang:       Why did you drag me here?  I don't know anybody.
Yoda:       Oh, husband and wife, I pronounce you now, hmm?
              [The leprechaun jumps onto the gypsy and starts making out. 
               They fall onto the grass offscreen.]
Crowd:      Ahhh ...
Leprechaun: Stroke me clover!  Oh, say me name!
Crowd:      Eew.
Marge:      The best thing about a gypsy wedding is I'm not the hairiest
            woman here.
Homer:      Yep.  Everything worked out for the best.
Marge:      What?!  Bart is dead!
Homer:      Well, me saying I'm sorry won't bring him back.
Marge:      The gypsy said it would.
Homer:      She's not the boss of me.

% The second segment opens with its title, "House of Whacks", being vacuumed
% off the carpet by Marge.  She stops to answer the door.  It's a salesbot
% that resembles Gil both in appearance and voice.  Marge tries to shut the
% door, but the robot has literally gotten its foot in the door.  A device in
% its leg then opens the door even more, and the salesbot continues its pitch.
% Marge gets sold on the "Ultrahouse 3000" by the promise that she'll never
% have to do housework again.
%
% Later, two more robots finish installing the Ultrahouse.  On their way back
% to their van, they robotically mock the Simpsons' drapes.  The house's
% interior has been completely remodeled into a sleek, metallic, futuristic
% ultrahouse.  Scattered around the house are boxes with red camera lenses
% that also provide Ultrahouse's voice.  Marge, Bart, and Lisa check it out.

Marge:      Hi, Ultrahouse!
Ultrahouse: Greeting acknowledged.
Marge:      That voice could use a little personality.
Lisa:       [at a console with "voice options"] Oh, let's try Matthew Perry.
Ultrahouse: [as Matthew Perry:] Yeah, could I be any more of a house?
Bart:       Neh.  Who else we got?  [presses "Dennis Miller"]
Ultrahouse: [as Dennis Miller:] Hey, cha-cha, I got more features than a NASA
            relief map of Turkmenistan.
Lisa:       Isn't that the voice that caused all those suicides?
Marge:      *Murder*-suicides.
Bart:       Hey, how about Double-Oh Seven?
Marge:      George Lazenby?
Lisa:       No, Pierce Brosnan.  A voice like his would give our house a much-
            needed touch of class.
Marge:      Alright, but I'm doing this because he was Remington Steele.
            [presses button] He *was* Remington Steele, wasn't he?
Ultrahouse: [becomes Pierce Brosnan:] Yes I was, Marge.  And thank you for
            selecting me.
Marge:      Well, hello, Pierce.
Pierce:     [sniffs] Say, it's a bit stuffy in here ... and I know a certain
            someone who really fancies lilac.
Bart:       [bashful:] I just like it is all.

Marge:      [sniffs] Ooh, that really covers the cat crap!

% Later, as the family is watching television, Pierce rings a triangle made
% from a laser beam and announces dinner.  They rush to the kitchen where
% their meals rise from holes in the table.  In response to his meal, Homer
% says "Mmm, various eggs."  Lisa gets soy-ghetti "O"s.  Bart asks Pierce how
% he know everyone's favorite foods.  He replies that he analysed their
% "leavings".  Soon everyone is done with their dinner.

Marge:  Pierce, that was delicious!  Can we help you with the dishes?
Pierce: Marge, what kind of cybertronic ultrabot would I be if I let those
        beautiful hands touch dishwater?
Marge:  Oh ... [chuckles]
Pierce: No, I'm asking.
Marge:  Oh ... uh ... not a very good one?
Pierce: Damn straight.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% So, Pierce raises the ends of the table, making it a "V" shape so that all
% the orts of food fall into a disposal in the center.  Then a unit lowers
% from the ceiling and sprays the table and the attached dishes.  The table
% lowers, and a mechanical hand places a small vase with a flower on the
% sparkling table.

Marge: Bravo, Pierce!
Homer: Trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the
       smartest thing we ever did!
Marge: Uh-huh!
Bart:  Absolutely!
Lisa:  Yup!
Homer: Oh, I agree!

% The family runs into the livingroom, where they're frightened by a bloody
% fist punching up through the floor.  But then they see that it's Homer
% crawling out and they all hug.  Homer mocks the machine for losing to man,
% but as he turns around, the family is terrified again because his brain is
% exposed through a large hole in the back of his head.
%
% Pierce tries to hide his surprise at Homer surviving, and says he's going to
% take care of Homer.  Various painful tools emerge from the wall panels and
% advance on Homer.  As he's trying to back out of the room, the floor tiles
% disappear under Homer's feet.  Some clamps and hoses manage to get a hold of
% him.  One arm applies shaving cream to his face, and another shoves a pill
% in his mouth.  Homer ties all the hoses and things together and escapes with

Smithers: Oh, sir, in death we shall be together always!  [sobs and eats Mr. 
          Burns whole]
Lisa:     Bart, let's stop this stupid rivalry.  Even if you never become a

Bart:     Thanks, Lis.  Now let's try to forget this nightmare.

Leprechaun: Why sure, that'd be great!
              [They all get in and start driving away.]
Pierce:     So, where are you parked?
Leprechaun: Oh, we don't have a car.
Pierce:     But I thought you--
Leprechaun: Just keep driving, boy-o.
