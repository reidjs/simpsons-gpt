% Breakfast at the Simpsons.  Homer and the kids chow down while Marge watches,
% standing and sipping her coffee.  The radio is tuned to the KBBL traffic
% report.

Bad news, drivers.  There's an overturned melon truck on the interstate.
Oh, it's a mess.  There's lots of rubber-necking and melon wrestling
going on, folks...
-- Bill Pie ``in the Sky'', KBBL traffic report, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Homer reaches for the milk, revealing a box of ``Yummy Donuts''.  Bart
% and Lisa struggle for custody of the box (Maggie's eyes watch the
% back-and-forth) until the donut pops out of the box, bounces off Homer's
% head, and lands on his plate.  Homer inhales the pastry.
%
% The school bus honks its horn, and the kids head out.  Marge holds up two
% lunchboxes:  ``You forgot the special lunches I made.''  Bart and Lisa
% help themselves to Marge's purse.  ``That's okay, Mom!'' responds Bart.
% ``We got money!'' finishes Lisa as she replaces the purse in Marge's
% pocketbook.  Marge's protest is interrupted by a ``Yaaaargh!'' from
% Homer as he glances at his watch and gets up.  Marge closes her eyes
% for a kiss, but Homer takes and drinks her coffee then leaves.

This is KBBL talk radio, K-Babble.  All talk, 24 hours a day.
If you'd like to share your embarrassing problem with our listening
audience, we invite you to call our therapist of the airwaves, Dr. Marvin
Monroe.  The number is 555-PAIN.
[Marge drums her fingers and casts nervous glances at the phone]
Don't be afraid, call now!
[Marge dashes for the phone]
-- ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Marge starts to explain her problem.  ``Hey lady, save your whining for
% when you're on the air, okay?''
%
% At the plant, Homer listens to the radio.  Dr. Monroe snuffs out his
% cigarette, reaches for another donut, and selects his next call.

Dr.MM: Next we have Marge.  She's 34 and trapped in a loveless sham of
       a marriage.
Homer: Hey, turn it up!  I love hearing those wackos!
-- The SNPP workers listen to a radio call-in show, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

Dr.MM: [radio talk show therapist]  Tell me about your husband, Marge.
Marge: [on the phone] When we were dating, he was sweeter... and more
       romantic! ...  [beginning to sob]  And forty pounds thinner,
       and he had hair... [burbling barely coherently]  And he ate
       with utensils!  [breaks down crying]
-- Marge calls KBBL, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Homer refuses to believe that it's his wife calling.

Dr.MM: Your husband sees you as nothing.
Marge: [pause]  Oh, okay.  Well, thank you.  [about to hang up]
Dr.MM: No no no, don't hang up!
-- Marge calls a radio talk show therapist, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% The plant employees nudge each other knowingly.

Dr.MM: The pig has made you into his mother.
       You are not the hot love object you deserve to be!
Marge: Really?
Dr.MM: I'm as sure of it as I'm sure my voice is annoying.
       Marge, tonight, the second he comes through that front door, you've got
       to tell him you're fed up, and if he doesn't start loving you,
       you will be leaving.
Marge: Leave Homer!?
Dr.MM: Please!  Don't use his real name!
Marge: Leave Pedro!?

Lisa: Aw, come on, Bart, not again!
Bart: [dialing the phone] Aw, where's your sense of humor.
Moe:  Moe's Tavern.
Bart: Hello, is Al there?
Moe:  Al?
Bart: Yeah, Al.  Last name:  Coholic.
Moe:  Lemme check...  [calls]  Phone call for Al.  Al Coholic.

      Listen, you little yellow-bellied rat jackass, if I ever find out
      who you are, I'm gonna kill you!
-- ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Homer's at the bar, dreading going home.  While Homer eats a pickled
% egg, he explains that Marge is going to leave him because he's a pig.
% Moe agrees; he <is> a pig.  Homer goes for a second opinion.

Homer:  Hey, Barney, am I a pig?
Barney: You're even more of a pig than I am!   [huge belch]
-- From someone who should know, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

Moe: Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the
     town.  Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards.
-- Gee, I didn't mean to put you to so much trouble, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% And after dinner, Moe suggests they check into a motel.  Homer likes the
% idea and heads out.
%
% The kids sit at the dinner table.  ``Wow, a quarter past six.  What's
% keeping Dad?'' asks Lisa.  Bart mutters, ``Yeah, he couldn't possibly
% be late on Meatloaf Night.''
%
% Homer wanders into the florist shop.

Homer:   [unsure of himself]  Uh, I'd like some flowers.
Florist: What kind of flowers?
Homer:   Uh, you know, pretty ones, not dead.
Florist: Well, we've have some beautiful long-stemmed roses.  They're $55
         a dozen.
Homer:   [thinks]  One, please.
-- Think small, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% It's now 8:35.  Marge stares angrily at the front door, growling.
% The kids approach her from behind with their empty plates and ask for
% some food.  Marge turns around and *ROARS*.  The kids scream and dash
% off in fright.  Marge turns back towards the door and waits...
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 5:33]
%
% As Marge growls at the door, evil thoughts penetrate her mind, and her
% eyes turn red...
%
% Outside in the rain, Homer holds a heart-shaped box of candy in one hand
% and a wilted rose in the other.  He practices his entrance, but realizes
% it's no use and just heads for the door.  Marge pulls the door open as
% Homer tries to insert the key.  Stunned, Homer holds up the candy and
% the flower.  ``I love you, Marjorie.''  Marge softens, and they kiss.
%
% In the kitchen, Bart dials the phone...

Bart: [dialing the phone] A little pre-dinner entertainment.
Moe:  [answering the phone]  Moe's Tavern.
Bart: Is Oliver there?
Moe:  Who?
Bart: Oliver Clothesoff.
Moe:  Hold on, I'll check.  [calls]  Oliver Clothesoff!  Call for Oliver

Bart+Lisa: [laugh]

% Homer fills Marge in on their itinerary...

Homer: And, I made reservations at Chez [pron. /chez/] Paree!
Marge: Oh, but Homer, that's expensive!
Homer: It matters not, mon frere!
-- A night on the town with the boys?  ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Marge picks up the phone to call a babysitter, and hears Moe:  ``Listen,
% you lousy bum, if I ever get a hold of you, I <swear> I'll cut
% your belly open!''  She hangs up, figuring it was a crossed wire,
% and tries again.  She calls the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Babysitting
% Service, but they refuse when she identifies herself as Mrs. Simpson.

Clerk: Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Babysitting Service!
Homer: Hello, this is Mr... Sam-son.
Clerk: Did your wife just call a second ago?
Homer: No, I said Samson, not Simpson.
-- Just checking, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

Actually, the Simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a
quite misunderstood and underrated family.
-- Homer pretends to be Mr. Samson, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Upstairs, Lisa watches Marge pretty herself up for a night out.
% Bart listens to Homer talk about his mambo dancing, but his smart
% mouth gets him thrown out.  Homer shaves (and his beard grows back
% almost immediately).
%
% The doorbell rings, and Homer tells Bart to answer it.

Aye-aye, Mambo-Man!
-- Bart, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Bart slides down the banister (*thud*) and answers the door as Lisa
% and Maggie join him.  He opens the door.  The kids swallow hard.
% It's the babysitter.  (Insert jarring chord.)  Curiously, Ms. Botz
% has brought two suitcases.  Marge leaves her with brief instructions:
% Maggie should be put to bed immediately; Bart and Lisa can watch
% ``The Happy Little Elves Meet The Curious Bear Cub''.

[moaning] Oh!  The Elves!  The Elves!
-- Quasi-Bart-o, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Marge kisses the kids good-bye.  Bart tries to get Ms. Botz to approve
% alternate viewing, but a menacing threat puts him in his place.  Ms. Botz
% carries Maggie away to bed.  (Maggie waves bye-bye.)
%
% At the restaurant, Homer checks out the lobster tank and chooses...
% the one floating upside-down at the top.
%
% Bart suffers through the Happy Little Elves...

Bart: [watching a Happy Little Elves tape] Oh, man, I can't take it any more!
Lisa: But I want to see what happens.
Bart: You <know> what happens.  They find Captain Quick's treasure.
      All the elves dance around like little green idiots.  I puke.  The End.
Lisa: Bart, you're just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love.
-- ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Bart switches to ``America's Most Armed and Dangerous'', though Lisa
% finds the show too scary.

The Cue-ball Killer should be considered extremely armed and dangerous.

-- ``Some Enchanged Evening''

% At the restaurant, the bubbly stops flowing, so Homer orders another bottle
% of their second-cheapest champagne.
%
% Back at the house...

The defenseless youngsters were tied up and gagged in the living
room, while the bandit roamed the house at will,
[TV pans over an empty house]

-- Watching `America's Most Armed and Dangerous', ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% To the music of the Larry Davis Experience, Homer and Marge mambo divinely.
%
% Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa watch more of America's Most Armed and Dangerous,
% and as the description of the Babysitter Bandit continues, they become
% increasingly frightened.  ``In a moment, we will show you a picture of the
% real Babysitter Bandit, Miss Lucille Botzcowski [pron. /botzokowsky/],
% and remember... she may be using a clever alias.''  A picture of Ms. Botz
% appears on the screen, and the kids scream.  Ms. Botz appears, carrying
% a length of rope.  Bart and Lisa: ``Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
% aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
% aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
% aaaaaaaaaa!''  Thunder roars outside.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:23]
%
% The kids make a run for it.  Bart ducks into the basement.  Lisa skids
% (cartoon style) into the kitchen and grabs the phone.  But she gets a
% busy signal.  Meanwhile, Homer and Marge are on the highway looking for
% Ye Olde Offramp Inn.  They spot it, but miss the exit.  ``No problemo,''
% says Homer.  ``We'll just get off at the next exit.''  A sign reads,
% ``Next Exit 34 Miles.''
%
% Ms. Botz descends into the basement looking for Bart.  While searching,
% she finds a cabinet of pickled beets and helps herself.  Atop the
% cabinet is Bart and a bowling ball.  Bart tries to roll the ball onto
% Ms. Botz, but he loses his balance and falls.

Seeing as no one was hurt, I think it would be really silly to dwell on this.

% Meanwhile, Lisa hides under the kitchen table and finally gets through.
% As she talks, she is dragged by the phone cord out from under the table.
% By Ms. Botz.  Oops.
%
% Homer carries Marge across the threshhold, stumbles, and trips, tossing
% Marge (``Wheeeee!!'') onto the waterbed, where she relaxes, while Homer
% rubs his knee.
%
% Back at home, Ms. Botz has finished tying up Bart and Lisa...

Bart: We know who you are, Ms. Botz.  Or should I say, Ms. Botzcowski.
      You're the Babysitter Bandit.

Lisa: He isn't.

% says, ``Quiet, Bart!  Let's make the best of this.''
%
% At the motel, Marge offers to go ``slip into something more comfortable'',
% and Homer hopes it's the blue thing with the... things.
%
% Maggie wakes up and grabs the mobile above her crib, which she uses as a
% trapeze, landing in a pile of stuffed animals.  She spots Ms. Botz in the
% hallway, relieving the closet of its valuables (and some unvaluables).
% Maggie then wanders downstairs and spots her elder siblings, as well as
% the Happy Little Elves.  She decides to watch the Elves.
%
% The movie ends, and Maggie tries to turn off the TV with the remote control.
% Lisa asks, ``Wanna watch the Happy Little Elves again?''  Maggie nods.
% ``But ya hafta untie me, first.''  Maggie does so.
%
% ``Oh... Homer...'' calls Marge seductively.  She's indeed wearing the blue
% thing with the... things.  Homer gives one of his lustful, ``Ohhhhh...''s.
%
% Ms. Botz continues her pillaging and spots Maggie walking through the
% hallway.  She follows the sound of the sucking, which leads her into
% a dark room.  (*whump*)  The lights come on.  Bart (sucking on Maggie's
% pacifier) has clobbered her with a baseball bat.
%
% Homer and Marge relax in the waterbed, and Marge decides to check up on
% things at home.  There is no answer because Bart, Lisa, and Maggie
% (clutching Bart's neck like a knapsack) have escaped out the window.
% The kids call from a pay phone.  (Bart goes down on all fours so Lisa
% can stand on his back to reach the phone.)

Operator: Hello, vigilant viewer.  How may we help you?
Lisa: We caught her!  We caught the Babysitter Bandit!  She's tied up
      at our house right now!
Bart: Ask if there's a reward.
Lisa: Is there a reward? ... [to Bart] If she's convicted, we get T-shirts.
Bart: Yeah!

%
% Homer helps Ms. Botz with her luggage (``Oh, these things are heavy!'')

Ms.Botz: Don't turn your back on that boy for a second.
-- Words of warning from the Babysitter Bandit, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Homer shuts off the TV.

Homer: Lord help me, I'm just not that bright.
