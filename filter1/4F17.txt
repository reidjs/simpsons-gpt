Marge:	[yawn] Lisa, what in the heck are you doing?
Lisa:	Oh, it's for my Junior Achievers Club.  We're trying to

Bart:	Oh, recycling is useless, Lis.  Once the sun burns out,

% At the headquarters of the Junior Achievers Club at Springfield 
% Elementary, Skinner reports that the "load of garbage" they saved 
% has given more money for the field trip to Albany.  The children 
% cheer.  Skinner introduces their guest speaker, who is slated to 
% teach the club about business:  Mr. Burns.  Only Skinner and one 
% other kid are applauding the arrival of Mr. Burns and Smithers.

I'll keep it short and sweet.  Family, religion, friendship.  These

When opportunity knocks, you don't want to be driving to a maternity 
hospital or sitting in some phony-baloney church.  Or synagogue.
-- Mr. Burns, guest speaking for Springfield Elementary's Junior
   Achievers, "The Old Man and the Lisa"

% Mr. Burns begins Q&A.

Burns:	  Questions?
	  [somewhat long pause, finally Skinner raises his hand]
Skinner:  Well, uh, I might take advantage of this rare opportunity 
	  even if you children aren't interested.  Ah, which do you 
	  think is more important?  Hard work, or stay-tunededness?
Burns:	  Are there any _real_ questions?
-- "The Old Man and the Lisa"

% Lisa asks Mr. Burns if his plant has a recycling center.  Mr. Burns 
% can't even comprehend what the word recycling means.  "Ree-cy-
% cleeng?"  Zoom to Mr. Burns' head, where we dissolve to an opening 
% dictionary.  The page begins with the word "Ragamuffin" as we scroll 
% down to a series of other tyrannical, threatening R words.  Mr. 
% Burns tells Lisa that he doesn't know what the word means, and calls 
% her a "ragamuffin."  Lisa tells him about how recycling helps Mother 
% Nature, to which Mr. Burns starts spitting upon mother nature for 
% the disasters she's given man.
%
% Mr. Burns states the opinion, "Surely, you agree we can do without 
% her!"  Lisa staunchly disagrees.  Mr. Burns is shocked.  Smithers 
% scolds her for questioning Mr. Burns.  Burns calls off Smithers, and 
% just tells Lisa to shut up because if he listened to people like 
% her, he wouldn't be worth $200 million today.  Lisa, however, read 
% Mr. Burns' "recent" biography, which portrays him as being only 
% worth $100 million.  Mr. Burns looks to Smithers, who hesitantly 
% informs him that he's actually worth considerably less than that.  
% Mr. Burns announces his departure.  Skinner says, "Monty Burns, 
% everybody!" and starts applauding.
%
% In Mr. Burns' office, Burns meets with his council of yes-men and 
% Smithers.

Mr. Burns:	I've called you all here because I need some honest 
		answers.  What is my current financial situation?
Yes-man #1:	Great!
Lawyer:		Great!
Smithers:	I hear great.

% Mr. Burns requests his stock portfolio.  He asks about his 
% Confederated Slavery Holdings.  He again receives more falsely 
% secure reports from his yes-men.  Smithers assures Mr. Burns that 
% he's secure because Mr. Burns managed his stocks.  Mr. Burns, with 
% arrogant confidence, asks for his stock ticker, which reports bad 
% news after September, 1929 -- conveniently right after he stopped 
% checking his stocks.

Burns:		Smithers, why didn't you tell me about this market 
		crash!
Smithers:	Um, well... sir, it happened twenty five years before I 
		was born.
Burns:		Oh, that's your excuse for everything!
-- "The Old Man and the Lisa"

% Mr. Burns creates a formula for bankruptcy to save his money.  He 
% asks Smithers to sink fifty percent of his money into obviously bad 
% stocks and asks the rest to be invested in the Baltimore Opera Hat 
% company.  "That should set things right again, eh, boys?"  Mr. Burns 
% asks.  The yes-men do what yes-men do, say "Yes."  As soon as Mr. 
% Burns is gone, everyone assumes worried expressions.
%
% Skinner and the Junior Achievers arrive at Uriah's Heap Recycling 
% Center, where Skinner plops down stacks of newspapers.

Skinner:	A half-ton of newspaper and all we get is seventy five 
		cents?  That won't even cover the gas I used to go to the 
		store to buy the twine to tie up the bundles.
Man:		It sounds like _you're_ working for your car-r-r.  
		Simplify-y, ma-an!
-- "The Old Man and the Lisa"

% Skinner loads the kids into his car and tells them that they don't 
% have enough money for the trip to Albany, and there is to be no more 
% recycling.  Lisa comments that they didn't do so badly, since they 
% collected enough paper to save a tree.  A frustrated Skinner backs 
% his car up so far it breaks a tree down.  The children start bawling 
% as Skinner drives away.
%
% At Mr. Burns' office, a stock diagram tells him that he is ruined.  
% When he asks the yes-men if he still made the right moves despite 
% his failure, they all say he did.  Mr. Burns finally sees the light.

Burns:		I see it all, now.  You're just a bunch of yes-men.  I 
		was making the wrong moves and you were too gutless to 
		tell me!  Isn't that right??
Yes-men:	Oh, yes, sure, etc.
Smithers:	Right on, sir.

% Mr. Burns asks Smithers to take out another mortgage on the plant,
