% It's the Krusty show.

Krusty: Hey, kids!  It's story time.  [laughs] I'm going to tell you the
        story of Krusty's expensive new suit: his sexual harassment
        suit.  [laughs painfully] Boy.
        Anyway, as part of Krusty's plea bargain, he has a new court-
        ordered sidekick, Ms.  No-Means-No.
         [to her] Whoa!  You're hot.  Let's get some dinner after the
        show.
         [she blows a whistle and holds up a stop sign with "NO" on it]
        I have dinner with all my employees, right, Sideshow Mel?
   Mel: We've never spoken outside of work.
Krusty: [laughs, then sighs] Oh...
  Bart: [watching] I'm surprised he doesn't try to blame his problems on
        his Percodan addiction.
Krusty: It wasn't my fault, it was the Percodan.  If you ask me, that
        stuff rots your brain.  And now a word from our new sponsor...
        Percodan?!  Aw, crap!

% Marge disapproves of Bart watching TV at breakfast.

Marge: Bart, are you ready for your history test?
 Bart: Oh, you bet, Mom!  Ask me anything.
Marge: OK.  Who was George Washington Carver?
 Bart: Um...the guy who chopped up George Washington?
Homer: Really?  Wow.
-- A learning experience for everyone, "'Round Springfield"

% Bart takes a spoonful of Krusty O's -- unfortunately, the one that
% contains the free jagged metal Krusty O -- and eats it.  After
% swallowing, he grimaces.

Marge: Bart, you said you were going to study.
 Bart: [clearly in pain] Oh!  My stomach.
Marge: Mmm, you just don't want to take that test.
 Bart: No, I mean it: it really hurts.
 Lisa: Mom, I think he's serious.
Homer: Kids are so naive.  Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll
       learn a few things, like when a sign says "Do not feed the
       bears," man, you better not feed the bears.  Now get to school,
       boy.
        [Bart walks off groaning with Lisa]
-- Sign, sign, everywhere a sign, "'Round Springfield"

% At school, Bart's condition is no better.

    Bart: Mrs. Krabappel, I can't take the test.  I have a stomach ache.
    Edna: Well, that's a lame excuse for an excuse.  Hah!
    Bart: Look, if you ignore me and I die, you'll get in a _lot_ of
          trouble.
    Edna: Read page six of the school charter.  [hands him one]
    Bart: "No teacher shall be held accountable if Bart Simpson dies."
    Edna: We're also absolved if Milhouse gets eaten by the school
          snake.
Milhouse: [inside the snake] Hey, cool!  There's a rabbit in here.
-- Mmm, absolution, "'Round Springfield"

% A little later, Bart puts his hand up.

 Bart: Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test.  Can I _please_ go to
       the nurse?
 Edna: Gosh, Bart, maybe you really are in pain.  Well...it would be
       cruel not to let you go.
        [files her nails, hums the national anthem]
        [hums part of "Stars and Stripes Forever"]
       Heh heh heh, _now_ you may go.
 Bart: [walking into nurse's room] Lunch Lady Doris?  Why are you here?
Doris: Budget cuts.  They've even got Groundskeeper Willy teaching
       French.
Willy: "Bonjourrr", you cheese-eating surrender monkeys!
-- The finer points of language, "'Round Springfield"

    Bart: Look, my stomach really hurts.
   Doris: All I can give you are these chewable Prozac for kids.  Your

          Unhappiness.
    Bart: [groaning] Oh...[collapses]
 Skinner: Superintendent Chalmers, I'd like you to meet our new school
          nurse, Lunch Lady Doris.
Chalmers: Yeah, nice to see you.  Seymour, why is that student lying
          unconscious on the floor?
 Skinner: Well in many cases, the floor is the best -- ahem.  Oh, look,
          here comes Lumpy, the school snake!

          Oh, Lord...
-- No promotions today, "'Round Springfield"

% Bart gets taken to the Springfield General Hospital.  In an operating
% theater, Dr. Hibbert reassures him.

Hibbert: Don't worry, son: you'll be fine.  This boy's appendix is
         inflamed and about to burst, which _will_ make it easier to
         find once I get in there.  [chuckles]
  Homer: [watching from above] Man, these are primo seats.  I could
         _really_ go for a hot dog.
  Marge: Homer!  This is an operation.
    Man: Hot dogs, get your hot dogs here!
  Homer: Woo hoo!
   Nick: OK, Bart, I will count to three, and you will be sound asleep.
         One, two, three...out like a light!
Hibbert: Scalpel...?
   Bart: [screaming] Aah!
   Nick: Whoopsie, heh.  Maybe if I fiddle with these knobs.  [sniffs]
         Hey, I smell gas...pleasant gas.  [sighs] Night-night gas...

  Marge: How's my special little guy?
   Lisa: How're you feeling, big brother?
          [Maggie sucks on her pacifier]
  Homer: Aw, this is wonderful: you're alive!
   Bart: [resentful] No thanks to _you_, Homer.
  Homer: Why you little...!
          [strangles Bart for a while]
Hibbert: Now Homer, please, the boy's just had a very serious operation.
  Homer: [sullen] All right.
-- Dr. Hibbert, voice of authority, "'Round Springfield"

% Bart's class comes in to visit him.

 Hibbert: Bart, I found the culprit: a jagged metal cereal O.
    Bart: Wicked!  [pulls up his gown] I got this cool scar, _and_ I get
          to miss a week of school!
           [his assembled classmates ooh and aah]
Milhouse: Dr. Hibbert, can I have _my_ appendix out?
           [the other children clamor in agreement]
 Hibbert: [chuckles] Why not?  Follow me, kids!  Nurse, prep these
          children!

% Lisa says "I'm glad you're OK, Bart," kisses him on the cheek, and
% walks out down the hall.  She hears a saxophone playing and stops.
% Eventually she spies the cause.

Lisa: Bleeding Gums Murphy!
  BG: Little Lisa.  It's good to see you again.
Lisa: It's been a long time...
       [flashback to 7G06, BG playing on the bridge]
  BG: My friends call me "Bleeding Gums".
Lisa: Ew.  How did you get a name like that?
  BG: Well, let me put it this way: you ever been to the dentist?
Lisa: Yep.
  BG: Not me.  I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my
      life as it is.
       [back to the present]
  BG: What are _you_ here for?
Lisa: My brother just had his appendix out.
  BG: Is he going to be OK?
Bart: [mooning them] Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks.  I'm doing my rounds, and,
      uh, I'm a little behind.
Lisa: [monotone] He'll be fine...
-- Bart bounces backside -- er, back, "'Round Springfield"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 5:36]

     BG: Lisa, I sure am glad you dropped by.  You're the first visitor
         I've had.
   Lisa: What about your family?
     BG: I don't really have a family.  All I had was a little brother
         who grew up to become a doctor.  He used to laugh at the most
         inappropriate times.
Hibbert: [chuckling] Hey, I've got an older brother that I'll never see.
         He's a jazz musician or some such.  Oh well, bye bye.  [walks
         out]
   Lisa: It must be awful to be all alone in the world.
     BG: Well, I always had my music.  I learned at the feet of Blind
         Willie Witherspoon.
          [flash to younger BG in a bar]
 Willie: I've been playing jazz for thirty years and I just can't make a
         go of it.  I want you to have my saxophone.
     BG: This isn't a saxophone, it's an umbrella!
 Willie: So I've been playing a umbrella for thirty years?  Why didn't
         anybody tell me?
     BG: Heh, we all thought it was funny.  [chuckles]
 Willie: That's not funny.
-- Differing senses of humor, "'Round Springfield"

% The scene returns to the present.

   BG: Then I got my big break: I was on Steve Allen's "Tonight Show".
        [flash to Steve Allen on stage and audience clapping]
Allen: Heh heh heh.  Now, a brilliant jazz musician who's inspired me to
       do some improv poetry.  [chuckles]
       Twinkle, twinkle, groovy cat, [BG starts playing]
       How I wonder where you at.
       I really love the way you cook,
       Just like me when I wrote this book.

       of "Happiness Is a Naked Steve Allen", "Journey to the Center of
       Steve Allen", and "The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen".
-- Jack Paar ain't got nothing on him, "'Round Springfield"

   BG: I cut my first and only album, "Sax on the Beach", but then I
       spent all my money on my $1,500 a day habit.
        [flashback]
       I'd like another Fabrege egg, please?
  Man: Sir, don't you think you've had enough?
   BG: I'll tell you when I've had enough!
        [back to the present]
 Lisa: When was the last time you worked?
   BG: In '86 when I did I guest shot on the Cosby Show.
        [flashback]
Cosby: Hey, kids!  Meet Grampa Murphy.
Child: We have three grampas already!
Cosby: This one's a great jazz musician.
Child: Oh, they _all_ are.
Cosby: Oh, oh: you see, the kids, they listen to the rap music which
       gives them the brain damage.  With their hippin', and the
       hoppin', and the bippin', and the boppin', so they don't know
       what the jazz...is all about!  You see, jazz is like the Jello
       Pudding Pop -- no, actually, it's more like Kodak film -- no,
       actually, jazz is like the New Coke: it'll be around forever, heh
       heh heh.
-- New commercial lows, "'Round Springfield"

% Lisa is impressed.

Lisa: Wow, you've had some career, although the moral seems to be that a
      lifetime of jazz leaves you sad and lonely.
  BG: Well, before you came to visit, I would have agreed with you.
-- Aw, "'Round Springfield"

% Kent Brockman delivers the news.

  Kent: This just in: Krusty the Klown staged a press conference today
        to defend himself against charges that his products are unsafe,
        his theme park is a death trap, and that he's marketing videos
        of Tanya Harding's wedding night.
Krusty: And I contend that those tourists were decapitated _before_ they
        entered the KrustyLand House of Knives[tm].  Next question?
 Woman: What about that little boy who got appendicitis from eating your
        cereal?
         [shot of Bart with Lionel Hutz]
Krusty: To prove that this metal O is harmless, I will personally eat
        one.  [takes a mouthful]
        See?  There's nothing -- [starts screaming and writhing] Oh,
        boy!  This thing is shredding my insides.
   Mel: Er, Krusty, that wasn't the metal one, that was a regular Krusty
        O.
Krusty: It's poison!
-- Not much of a vote of confidence, "'Round Springfield"

% Back at the hospital...

    BG: So, you all set for your recital?
  Lisa: I sure am!  Look: [shows her gums] I stopped brushing my teeth
        so I can play just like you.
    BG: Aw.  Lisa, honey, music comes from what's in your heart, not
        what's on your teeth.  Come on, let's jam.
         [he starts to play; Lisa sings]
  Lisa: Lift me, won't you lift me above the old routine?
        Make it nice, play it clean, Jazzman!
         [she plays with him]
         [people in the hospital hear and start to dance]
        When the Jazzman's testifyin', a faithless man believes.

Barney: Hey Moe, what'll you give me for an A. A. Chip?
   Moe: Uh, Barney, this is a five minute chip.  Ehh, it's worth a
        Pabst.  [draws him one]
-- Moe, just making his living, "'Round Springfield"

% The song ends and BG hugs Lisa.  "Baby, you are going to knock 'em

% At the sold out school recital, Principal Skinner introduces the
% orchestra.

 Skinner: Now I have learned that most of the orchestra is having their
          appendixes removed, so without further ado, I give you the
          remnants of the Springfield Elementary School Orchestra: on
          saxophone, Lisa Simpson, on triangle, Martin Prince, and with
          a flute up his nose, Ralph Wiggum.
           [Ralph blows a couple of notes]
  Wiggum: That's some nice flutin', boy.
 Skinner: They will be playing "Stars and Stripes Forever", hopefully
          not forever.
           [they start playing]
Audience: Boo!
     Abe: It sucks!
           [Lisa jazzes it up a bit; everyone applauds]

    Lisa: Hey, Bleeding Gums!  I was great, and I owe it all to --
           [a nurse fixes his bed]
           [gasp] What happened to Mr. Murphy?
   Nurse: I'm sorry.  He passed away.
-- Like sands through an hourglass, "'Round Springfield"

% Lisa goes to the bridge to cry.  At home, she weeps into her pillow
% when Homer walks in.

Homer: Lisa, honey, are you going to be OK?
 Lisa: Bleeding Gums was my hero and I never got to tell him how I felt.
Homer: Oh, I'm sure he knew, and I'm sure that wherever he is now, he's
       happy.
 Lisa: But he was the only person that had the same love for music that
       I do.
        [Maggie gives Lisa a pacifier]
       Thank you.  Oh, Dad, why did he have to die?
Homer: Well, it's like the time that your cat Snowball got run over.
 Lisa: Uh huh.
Homer: Remember, honey?
 Lisa: Yeah.
Homer: What I'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and
       get a new jazzman.
 Lisa: [wailing] Oh, Dad!  [weeps]
Homer: Oh, I blew it again.
        [Maggie gives him a pacifier]
       What?  [sucks on it] Mmm...
-- Homer, competent parent, "'Round Springfield"

% Lisa goes to the treehouse to be alone.  Bart joins her.

   Bart: Hey, Lis, you still upset about that jazz guy?
   Lisa: [noticing Bart] Oh.
   Bart: If it helps, I believe that after you die, you come back as
         whatever you want.  I'll be a butterfly.
   Lisa: How come?
   Bart: Because, nobody _ever_ suspects the butterfly.  [laughs]
          [flash to a smouldering school]
Skinner: [being restrained] I didn't burn down the school.  It was the
         butterfly, I tell you, the butterfly!
 Wiggum: He's crazy, boys.  Get the taser.
          [a small Bart butterfly holds a gas can and laughs]
-- The ultimate reincarnation fantasy, "'Round Springfield"

Lisa: Uh, maybe I need to talk to somebody with a little more age and
      wisdom.
 Abe: Death stalks you at every turn!
Lisa: Grampa!
 Abe: Well, it does -- aah!  Death!  There it is.  Death!
Lisa: It's only Maggie.
 Abe: [laughs sheepishly] Oh, yeah.  You know, at my age, the mind
      starts playing tricks.  So -- aah!  Death!
Lisa: That's only the cat.
 Abe: Oh.  Aah!  Death!
Lisa: That's Maggie again, Grampa.
 Abe: Oh.  Where were we?  Death!
-- Tricks indeed, "'Round Springfield"

% At a meal, everyone but Lisa eats.

 Lisa: How come it won't stop hurting?
Marge: Oh, Lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and Bleeding
       Gums was a good friend to you.  But nobody is really gone as long
       as we remember them.
Homer: Lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, I
       recommend getting a tattoo.  It preserves the things you love.
        [pulls up his sleeve]
       "Starland Vocal Band"?!  They suck!
  Abe: [pointing to the birdbath] Death!

% It's raining the day of BG's burial.  Lisa and Rev. Lovejoy are the

Lovejoy: Well, Lisa, we've waited an hour.  [clears his throat, reads]
         Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here today to bid farewell to
         Blood and Guts Murphy.
   Lisa: No!  It was Bleeding Gums Murphy.
Lovejoy: Yecch!  Anyway, Bloody Gums Murphy was quite the sousaphone
         player --
   Lisa: Saxophone!  He was a jazz musician.  You didn't know him --
         nobody knew him, but he was a great man, and I won't rest until
         all of Springfield knows the name Bleeding Gums Murphy!
  Homer: And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog.
  Marge: Homer, this is a cemetery.
    Man: Hot dogs!  Get your hot dogs here.
  Homer: Woo hoo!  [buys one]
  Marge: What do you do, follow my husband around?

Bart: [suspicious] What kind of legal fees?
Hutz: [looking nervous] Well, for a case this complex, I had to assmeble

 Lisa: Mom, I want to honor Bleeding Gums' memory but I don't know where

Marge: Maybe you could get the local jazz station to do a tribute to
       him, huh?
Homer: Jazz, pfft.  They just make it up as they go along.  I could do
       that: dee dee-dee dee dee dee dee, dee dee dee --
Marge: That's "Mary Had a Little Lamb".
Homer: OK, then, this: doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo --
Marge: That's the same thing; you just replaced "dee"s with "doo"s.

Lisa: What if I could find it?
  DJ: Well, I'd spin it for you, but you know, ain't no one going to
