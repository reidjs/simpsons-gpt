% Bart and Lisa pass the time by watching "The Planet From Outer
% Space," a science-fiction movie that was either filmed in the 50s,
% or by someone with a very acute sense of retro filmmaking.  The word
% "science" is loosely applied here.  When the ship's hull is
% breached, "space air" rushes in and gags the astronauts until they
% put on goggles which allow them to breathe freely.  The captain
% lights up a cigarette, then gasps when a "monster from space"
% threatens the ship.  Bart and Lisa aren't fooled for a second.  They
% see that the "monster" is really a dog in a harness and fishbowl
% "space helmet."
%
% And now for a word from our sponsor.  A man in his late 50s or early
% 60 addresses the camera.

Colonel:	Hi.  I'm Colonel Chet Manners, five-time space 
		shuttle alternate.
Bart:		[offscreen] Loser!
Colonel:	Would you like to boldly go where people like me but 
		not me have gone before?  [holds up a model rocket 
		kit] Then get the Orbit King, with yaw control like 
		you've never seen.
		[cut back to the Simpsons' TV room]
Bart:		Hey, Lis, is Dad's credit card number 
		5784365343410709?
Lisa:		You know it is.
-- Bart Simpson, identity thief, "She of Little Faith"

% Six to eight weeks later, Homer is in the bathroom, flossing to the
% tune of Devo's "Whip It."

When you have a rib-eye steak,
    You must floss it.
Oh, that meatloaf tasted great.
    You must floss it!
Now, floss it!  Floss it good!
-- Homer Simpson, "She of Little Faith"

% Bart walks up with his new model kit, and asks Homer if he wants to
% help.  He does, so he joins Bart and Milhouse in the back yard and
% helps them glue the pieces of rocket together.

Milhouse:	I didn't know your dad was so interested in science.
Homer:		Science!?
Bart:		Uh, he didn't say, "science."  He said, "pie pants."
Homer:		Mmmm, pie pants.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% The rocket is soon ready to launch, and Homer begins his countdown. 
% Before he can reach T-0, the rocket explodes.  The shock of the
% explosion blasts the eyebrows off Milhouse's forehead and onto
% Bart's cheeks.
%
% Undaunted by failure, Homer and the boys try again.  Homer duct-
% tapes a new rocket to the launch pad.

Homer:		The word "un-blow-up-able" is thrown around a lot 
		these days, but I think I can say with confidence 
		...
		[boom!]
		Okay, that shows you what could potentially happen.
		[just then, a model rocket launches from the other 
		side of the backyard fence]
		What was that?
Ned:		[looking over the fence] Greetings from Neddidy 
		Space Center on Cape Flandaveral.  We noticed your 
		sky-ro-technics and thought we'd join in.  [looks 
		up] Ooh, looks like a perfect landing.
		[the Flanders's rocket not only lands gently, but it 
		lands in its original box and neatly closes the 
		flaps behind it]
Milhouse:	Wow!  Did you see that yaw control?
Homer:		I have eyes, don't I?
-- "She of Little Faith"

% This time, Homer calls in the big guns -- the nerds he met when he
% attended Springfield University.  They assemble an impressive scale
% model of the Saturn V moon rocket.

Homer:	I would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.
Gary:	Well, then could you stop calling us nerds?
Homer:	Dweeb, wonk, spaz -- it's all good.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% The nerds finish the rocket.  For their troubles, Homer shoos them
% (Milhouse, too) of his property.
%
% Just as the real space program sent up chimpanzees as its first
% "astronaut," Homer and Bart's rocket will launch an animal into the
% skies.  There being no chimps handy, the rocket will carry Nibbles
% the hamster.  The hamster, in a spacesuit, says goodbye to a female
% hamster dressed in a tiny copy of Jackie Kennedy's pink outfit.

Marge:	Oh, he's leaving her with five babies.
Bart:	She already ate three.
Marge:	Oh.  That's sensible.
-- Pity she didn't think of it sooner, "She of Little Faith"

% As majestic music plays, the hamster-astronaut rides up the gantry
% to the space capsule.

Son, we are about the break the surly bonds of gravity, and punch the 
face of God.
-- Homer Simpson, "She of Little Faith"

% This time, the launch is perfect (if you forgive Homer counting
% down, "five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... countdown!"). 
% The rocket launches with such force that it stretches the hamster's
% features back, exposing his teeth.  It traces a graceful white arc
% across the blue sky, inspiring one man to give up drinking, and
% another man to start.
%
% The rocket begins to drift off course.  Homer tries to radio a set
% of complicated directions to Nibbles.  The hamster looks briefly at
% the control panel, sees the red eject button, and quickly gets a
% better idea.  He head-butts the button, and ejects to safety.
%
% The unmanned rocket heads for the church.  Homer goes to his backup
% plan:  He pulls out a shotgun and fires wildly at the rocket.  He
% misses, and the rocket crashes into the church, ricocheting around
% and causing havoc before bouncing out and landing in the front lawn. 
% The flames and smoke are visible from the Simpsons' back yard.

Marge:	This is the worst thing you've ever done!
Homer:	You say that so much it's lost all meaning.
-- Worst nagging ever, "She of Little Faith"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  5:42]
%
% The church council -- Marge, Ned, Kearney, Jasper, Mrs. Skinner, and
% the Lovejoys -- convene in the shadow of the ruined church and try
% to figure out how to afford the repairs.

Marge:		Fixing all that damage is going to be very 
		expensive.
Lovejoy:	Yes, barring some sort of miracle.  [looks 
		Heavenward, expectantly.  Nothing happens] All 
		right, we'll help ourselves -- yet again.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% The meeting continues.

Lovejoy:	People, we need some fund-raising ideas.
Marge:		Let's just write to David Bowie again.
Lovejoy:	No, he's done enough for this church.  Anyone else?
		[a sinister chord is heard, and the shadow of a 
		horned being falls across the council.  The camera 
		pans to reveal that it's Mr. Burns, with the "horns" 
		being twin cowlicks of hair]
Burns:		[he smoothes down his hair and approaches the group]  
		I've got the answer.  Let me run this church like a 
		business.
Ned:		It's kind of you to offer, Mr. Burns, but the buzz 
		around town is that you're, well, evil.
Burns:		Oh, that's just a skip-rope rhyme.  Believe me, the 
		Lord's going to go for this in a big way.  Now, 
		who's with me?
Lovejoy:	Oh, I guess we have no choice.
Burns:		Excellent.  [a crucifix falls off the church and 
		smites Burns on the head]
		[looking up and shakes his fist] Oh, you'll get 
		yours.
-- Vengeance is mine, saith the Burns, "She of Little Faith"

% Mr. Burns introduces the church council to Lindsey Naegle, the
% consultant he has hired to oversee the church's renovation.

Naegle:		I guarantee I can find some new revenue streams.  
		Step one:  Let's sell some ad space.  Reverend, how 
		would you feel about wearing this robe?  [holds up a 
		robe with "Fatso's Hash House" embroidered on it]
Lovejoy:	Mmm ... conflicted?
Burns:		Too bad!  You've already signed the deal.
Naegle:		Actually, he hasn't.
Burns:		Oh.  Well, we highly value your input.  [menacing] 
		Until you sign the deal.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% In spite of Rev. Lovejoy's misgivings, Naegle and Burns continue to
% remake the church in their image.  Workers carry advertising signs
% and a Lard Lad statue inside the church as Bart and Lisa watch.

Lisa:	What are they doing to the church?
Naegle:	We're rebranding it.  The old church was skewing pious.  
	We prefer a faith-based emporium teeming with impulse buy 
	items.
Lisa:	I feel like I want to throw up.
Naegle:	Then my work is done.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% And three weeks later, Ms. Naegle's work truly is done.  I giant
% neon statue of Jesus as a lasso-swinging cowboy beckons the faithful
% to services.  Inside, the faithful behold a multitude of advertising
% signs, placards, and billboards.  The impulse buy items Lindsey
% mentioned are there, too, including an in-house money changer. 
% ("Get your money changed right here in the temple," says the
% vendor.)  Bart has his picture taken in a one of those novelty photo
% backgrounds where you stick your head through a cutout to make it
% appear as though you are somewhere else.  In keeping with the church
% scene, the background is Da Vinci's "The Last Supper," with the
% cutout where Jesus' face would be.  Marge insists that Bart do at
% least one smiling photo to send to grandma.
%
% The Simpsons settle into the extra-wide seats, which resemble the
% first-class chairs on an airliner.  Lisa resolves not to be taken in
% by the glitz, but Marge is more concerned that Lisa's on the "God
% Cam" Jumbotron.  Whoever is running the camera has superimposed
% "Pouting Thomas" in Lisa's image.  The other parishioners think it's
% adorable.
%
% Rev. Lovejoy is still there, conducting services as he has always
% done.  Well, maybe not as he has always done them ...

Lovejoy:	And Lord, please remember our infirm parishioners, 
		especially Mrs. Glick, who's recovering from hip 
		surgery.  And now let us rise and, um, umm ...
		[pull back into a control room.  Burns and Naegle 
		look at Lovejoy on a monitor]
Naegle:		He's not going to say it.
Burns:		Trust me, he'll say it, or I'll bust him down to 
		Thursday night vespers.
Lovejoy:	... and thank Crazy Larry, whose big-screen TV 
		prices are insane-ane-ane!  [chuckles weakly]
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Rev. Lovejoy introduces pizza mascot The Noid, who will deliver a
% special sermon on "deliciousness."

Lisa:		That's it!
Homer:		[whispering] Quiet, Lisa!  Everyone in the store is 
		looking at you.
Lisa:		They should take a good look at themselves, and what 
		their church has become.
		[the congregation gasps]
Lovejoy:	Lisa, it's still the same basic message -- we've 
		just dressed it up a little.
Lisa:		Like the Whore of Babylon?
		[the congregation gasps]
Lovejoy:	That is a false analogy!
Lisa:		No, it's not.  It's apt.  Apt!  [more gasping] Don't 
		you see what Mr. Burns has done to this church?
Mel:		He restored it from nave to narthex!
CBG:		He super-sized the pews for the zaftig believer.
Patty:		He put ice in the urinals.
Lisa:		Those are all wonderful things, but they cost the 
		church its soul.  I for one will not be a part of 
		it.
		[gets up and walks out]
Usher:		Do you want your hand stamped so you can come back 
		in?
Lisa:		No.  I'm leaving this church forever!
		[leaves and closes the door behind her]
Marge:		Oh, no!
Homer:		I don't know how to feel.
Marge:		You should be very upset.
Homer:		Got it.  [anguished wail]  How was that?
Marge:		A little much.
Homer:		[softer cry]
-- "She of Little Faith"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  10:27]
%
% Lisa says her bedtime prayers.

Lisa:	Lord, I'm not turning my back on you.  I just need to find 
	a temple that's free of corruption.
	[Marge is hiding on the other side of the bed]
Marge:	[spectral] Why do you have to be so different?  Always 
	making a big deal out of everything?  [ghostly moan]
Lisa:	Mom, I know it's you.  I can't believe you're 
	eavesdropping on my prayers.
Marge:	[Marge sits up] Oh, honey, I'm worried about your soul.  I 
	want at least one person from this family to go to Heaven.
Lisa:	I still believe in God.  I just think there's another path 
	to Him -- or Her.
Marge:	Her?!  [holds Lisa and looks up] She's just kidding, Mr. 
	Lord!
-- Marge the fundamentalist, "She of Little Faith"

% Thus begins Lisa's spiritual quest.  She studies a few books of
% comparative theology, like "Zagat's Guide to World Religions."  Bart
% stops by her room.

Bart:	Still looking for a new faith?
Lisa:	Yep.
Bart:	Hey, how about one of those religions where you eat a 
	human heart?
Lisa:	No.
Bart:	How about Methodist?
Lisa:	NO!  Look, I'm not just going to pick a religion that 
	seems cool.  I'm going to pick one that's right for me.
Bart:	How about Judaism?  When you turn thirteen, cha-ching!
Lisa:	I'm going out for a walk.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Lisa's walk takes her past the temples of many faiths.  Finally, she
% arrives at Springfield's Buddhist temple.  Intrigued, she goes in. 
% Lenny and Carl are there, meditating.

Lisa:	Lenny and Carl?  You guys are Buddhist?
Carl:	Oh, yeah.  If I didn't have inner peace, I'd go completely 
	psycho on all you guys all the time.
Lisa:	Well, I'm looking for a new faith, one that isn't so 
	materialistic.
Gere:	Well, you've come to the right place.  Buddhism teaches 
	that suffering is caused by desire.
Lisa:	[gasps] Richard Gere?
Lenny:	Ooh!  The world's most famous Buddhist.
Gere:	Well, what about the Dalai Lama?
Carl:	You know, the fourteen incarnation of the Buddha 
	Avalokesvara.
Lenny:	Who's Buddha?
Gere:	It's a good thing Buddha teaches freedom from desire, 
	'cause I've got the desire to kick your ass.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Lisa says she's looking for a religion that will bring her inner
% peace, so Mr. Gere gives her a pamphlet that introduces her to the
% religion's central teachings.  Turning to more earthly concerns,
% Carl asks Gere if he really did all those sit-ups in "Officer and a
% Gentleman."  Nope -- they just looped the film of Gere's one sit-up.
%
% Back at home, Lisa looks at the Buddhist pamphlet, which explains
% that good actions lead to happiness, while evil actions bring on
% unhappiness.  Instead of emphasizing creator-gods, Buddhism stresses
% the search for enlightenment.  That's enough for Lisa.  She opens
% her bedroom window and shouts to the world, "I'm a Buddhist!"  Her
% yell startles a flock of birds out if its tree.  The Flanderses can
% hear it next door.

Lisa:	[offscreen] Hey, I'm a Buddhist!
Ned:	[gasp] My Satan sense is tingling!  Into the root cellar, 
	boys!
Todd:	When can we come out?
Ned:	Maybe never.
Rodd +
 Todd:	Yay!
	[they all go to the cellar, closing a heavy steel door 
	behind them]
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Breakfast time.

Homer:	So, you think you know better than this family, huh?  
	Well, as long as your in my house, you'll do what I do, 
	and believe what I believe.  [the camera pans to reveal 
	that Homer is talking to Bart] So butter your bacon!
Bart:	Yes, father.  [does so]
Lisa:	Mom, Dad, my spiritual quest is over.
Homer:	Hold that thought.  [to Bart] Bacon up that sausage, boy.
Bart:	Dad, my heart hurts.  [Homer glares at him] Ohh.  [wraps a 
	slice of bacon around a sausage link and eats it]
Lisa:	I'm a Buddhist!
Homer:	What?  That's it -- no more chat rooms for you!
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Marge tries to bribe Lisa back to Christianity with dessert, but
% Lisa has already overcome her desire for treats.
%
% Lisa's conversion has some fallout at school.

Jimbo:		Hey, Simpson, I hear your sister dumped 
		Christianity.
Bart:		Who cares?
Dolph:		I'll tell you someone who cares.  He's got long 
		hair, works as a carpenter, has a lot of crazy ideas 
		about love and brotherhood.
Jimbo:		His name's Gunnar and he's dating my mom.  Sometimes 
		he buys us beer.
Bart:		I thought Kearney was dating your mom.
Kearney:	Hey -- *she* came on to *me*.
Jimbo:		Get him!  [the bullies attack Kearney.  Bart waits a 
		moment, and then joins in]
-- What would Gunnar do?  "She of Little Faith"

% Lisa plants a small tree in the back yard.

Marge:	Hey, Lisa, what are you doing?
Lisa:	I'm planting my own bodhi tree.  If I meditate under it, 
	perhaps I can find inner peace.
Marge:	Honey, is this about some boy at school who doesn't like 
	you?
Lisa:	No!
Marge:	Good.  I'm just saying that any boy who doesn't like you 
	is not worth your time.
Lisa:	[begins to meditate] Om mani padme hum.  Om mani padme 
	hum.  Om mani padme hum.
Marge:	Oh -- you're going to get a bath tonight.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% At the church, Burns announces that church revenues are up 1,073% --
% and that he's keeping the money for himself.  He tosses a smoke bomb
% on the floor, but the smoke clears before Burns can make his escape. 
% Disgusted, he throws the money on the council's table and leaves. 
% The council takes up other matters.

Lovejoy:	Well, next on our agenda:  Marge Simpson's devil 
		daughter.
Marge:		She's not a devil.  I just don't know what to do.
Ned:		Well, Christmas is coming, huh?
Lovejoy:	Yeah, and Santa doesn't leave presents under the 
		bodhi tree.  [winks and taps his nose]
Marge:		You think we can bribe her back with Christmas?
Lovejoy:	[holds up a Bible] Marge you can save more souls 
		with roller skates and Easy-Bake ovens than with 
		this two thousand page sleeping pill.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% And so begins "Operation X-Mas Remind of How Good Is."  Marge
% dispatches Homer to place a Christmas angel on Lisa's bodhi tree. 
% At first she doesn't mind, since the angel is tastefully designed --
% but that's before Homer flips a switch that causes it to bark to the
% tune of "Jingle Bells."
%
% Next Marge makes some Christmas cookies to tempt Lisa, and then
% tosses them out since Lisa's no longer a Christian.  Bart walks into
% the kitchen, notices the trash cookies, and wolfs them down right
% out of the garbage can.  He gags on something and tells Marge, "Uh,
% oh, I think I ate a dog food lid."
%
% Marge tries even harder to get her daughter back into the fold.  She
% and the family put on their Christmas sweaters, and wait for Lisa to
% come down from her room.

Marge:		Here she comes!  And-a one, and-a two, and-a ...
Family:		[caroling] We wish you a Merry Christmas,
		We wish you a Merry Christmas,
		We wish you a Merry Christmas,
		We wish ...
		[Lisa enters the room]
Marge:		Oh, hello, Lisa.
Lisa:		I just came down for a glass of water.
Marge:		Oh.  Well, you do have a present under the tree.  I 
		guess no one told Santa you were a Buddhist.
Lisa:		Well, Santa can take it back, because I'm not ruled 
		by material desi-- [gasps] Is that a pony?!
		[she indicates what looks like a pony wrapped in 
		paper.  Only the muzzle is exposed]
Homer:		I don't know what Santa left you.  I just know his 
		name is Clip-Clop and he loves sugar.  [feeds a few 
		cubes to the present]
Marge:		Lisa, we love you and we're not trying to put any 
		pressure on you.  [nudges Maggie to Lisa with her 
		foot.  Maggie toddles over and offers Lisa a candy 
		cane]
Lisa:		Aww ...
		[she takes the cane, then sees Rev. Lovejoy peeking 
		through the living-room window]
Lovejoy:	Lick it.  Lick it!
Lisa:		No!  [runs out of the room]
Marge:		Oh, no!  Our daughter's run away on Christmas Eve!
		[the present's wrapping paper tears open.  It's 
		Ralph in the front half of a horse costume]
Ralph:		More sugar, please.
Homer:		Bag's in the kitchen.
Milhouse:	[bursts out of the present's hindquarters] All 
		right!  [runs into the kitchen]
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Lisa runs to the Buddhist temple.  Lenny, Carl, and Richard Gere are
% there.

Lisa:	My family tried to trick me into celebrating Christmas!
Gere:	You know, we are meditating.  [points to a "Meditation in 
	Progress" sign]
Lisa:	Oh, sorry.
Gere:	Oh, that's all right.  I was only about to achieve 
	enlightenment, but who'd want that?
Lenny:	[trancelike] Who likes short shorts?
Carl:	[trancelike] I like short shorts.
Gere:	Those guys are way off.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Mr. Gere helps Lisa make peace (inner and outer) with her family.

Gere:	Anyway, Lisa, your family didn't have to trick you.  
	Buddhists respect the diversity of other religions, as 
	long as they're based on love and compassion.
Lisa:	[incredulous] Wha?
Gere:	It's true.  So why don't you go home?  I'm sure your 
	family really misses you.
Lisa:	I can really celebrate Christmas?
Gere:	You can celebrate any holiday.  And, you know, my birthday 
	is August 31st.
Lisa:	Oh, I'll send you an e-mail greeting card.
Gere:	Sweet.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% So Lisa heads back to her family.  Mr. Gere will be spending
% Christmas with Hannah, his daughter, and the two will be doing each

% him from "accidentally" killing himself.  (Carl, thinking ahead, has
% already taken Moe's noose.)
%
% The Simpsons search for Lisa.  Sort of.

Homer:	[carrying Santa's Little Helper] I did it!  I found our

Marge:	We were looking for Lisa.
Bart:	I thought we were caroling.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Marge gives up and decides to call the police.  As she reaches for

Marge:	You came back!
Lisa:	Yeah, I wanted to spend Christmas with you guys.
Homer:	So you're back on the winning team?
Lisa:	No, I'm still Buddhist, but I can worship with my family, 
	too.
Marge:	So you're just going to pay lip service to our church?
Lisa:	Uh-huh.
Homer:	That's all I ever asked.
-- He of few demands, "She of Little Faith"

% Marge promises she'll pray double hard to cover for Lisa.  She and
