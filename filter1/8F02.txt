Ahem.  Hello, everyone.  Before last year's Hallowe'en show, I warned you
not to let your children watch.  But you did anyway.  Mm.  Well, this
year's episode is even worse.  It's scarier, more violent, and I think
they snuck in some bad language, too.  So please, tuck in your children
and... [sighs]  Well, if you didn't listen to me last time, you're not
going to now.  Enjoy the show.

% Marge and the kids return from trick-or-treating.  Bart is a hooded

% native Americans of the Pacific Northwest), and Marge the Bride of
% Frankenstein (what else could she possibly be?).  Marge tells the kids
% they can have one piece of candy before bed, but before she finishes
% her sentence, everybody (including Homer and Maggie) has begun gorging
% themselves on candy.

Marge: If you eat too much, you'll have nightmares.
Bart:  [mouth full of candy]  [sarcasm] Oh yeah, everybody in the family
       is going to have bad nightmares tonight, ha!
Lisa:  [more sarcasm] Oh yeah, three bad nightmares.
Homer: [yet more sarcasm]  I'd like to see that!  Heh heh heh!

% They watch a contortionist do his thing.  (Says Bart, ``I can do that,
% but I don't want to.'')  At a market, Homer inquires after a monkey's
% paw, which the vendor claims will grant wishes to its owner.

Vendor: Sir, I must strongly advise you:  Do not purchase this.

       Oh, no, wait, it was over there.

% Bart decides he's waited long enough and wishes for the Simpsons to be

Marge:   Homer, maybe fame and fortune aren't as bad as they say.
Woman 1: If I hear one more thing about the Simpsons, I swear, I'm going

Woman 2: At first they were cute and funny, but now they are just annoying.

I'll make a wish that can't backfire.  I wish for a turkey sandwich, on

turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don't want any
other weird surprises.  You got it?

Not bad.  Nice, hot mustard.  Good bread.  The turkey's a little dry.

[townsfolk wander around with nervous smiles, saying, `Happy happy!']
