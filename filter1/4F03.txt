Indian #1: Thank you.  I just wish Ben and Hoss and Little Joe and Hop

           today to see this wonderful turnout.
Indian #2: You know, on the series, we were always trying to kill the
           Cartwrights.
            [audience boos]

Salesman: I see.  Do you have a receipt, quote, unquote, sir?
     CBG: No, I do not have a receipt.  I won it as a door prize at the
          Star Trek Convention, although I find their choice of prize
          highly illogical, as the average Trekker has no use for a

around to show left and right arrows on the backside of the belt, which

-- The caringest father in the world, "The Homer They Fall"

% Bart explains.

      Homer: Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand:

             grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start.
       Bart: But then they'll just beat me up even worse!
      Homer: Yes, they are a clever bunch.  I know.  I'll squeal for
             ya... to their parents!
              [later that day...]
Jimbo's dad: [punches him in the face]  That's for telling me how to

% The men slowly back away out of Moe's.  Moe tends to Homer's injury.

  Moe: Geez, Homer.  I never seen a guy stand up to that kind of
       punishment. I mean, you took a three-man pounding and didn't even
       fall down.
Homer: Big deal.  I didn't even get my kid's belt back.  The only thing
       a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
  Moe: There you go!  That's the spirit!  Homer, I've seen prizefighters
       couldn't take a punch half as good as you.  You know, boxing
       might be right up your alley.
Homer: Really?
  Moe: Oh please!  It's the good life, Homer.  Some of these boxers,
       they eat steak _and_ lobster _and_ salad bar all in a single

Homer: [raising dirty pail]  Hey, what's this?

  Moe: Yeah, he was my manager.  Back when I was Gorgeous, everybody
       wanted a piece of me.  But somehow, I just never made it to the
       big time.
Homer: Why not?
  Moe: 'Cause I got knocked out forty times in a row.  That, plus

   Moe: Lucius!  Hey!  What's a glitteradi like you doing in my dump?
        I thought you were managing the champ.
Lucius: Yes, managing Drederick has been my highest priority, even
        though he is temporarily incarcerated for pushing his mother
        down the stairs. But with his inpending release, I've been

Man #2: Drederick, ah, what do you think of Homer Simpson?
 Tatum: I think he's a good man.  I like him.  I got nothing against
