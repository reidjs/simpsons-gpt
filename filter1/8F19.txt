% The family wander through the Googolplex Cinema parking lot, trying to find
% a parking space.  Every spot they find is stolen from them just before they
% reach it.  Homer finds a space labelled ``Compacts only''.  He reasons,
% ``Marge, that's just a suggested car size.''  Homer squeezes the car into
% the space (scratching the cars on either side in the process).  ``How am
% I doing on the right?''  Lisa responds, ``Well, we're getting a lot of
% sparks over here, Dad.''  Homer `succeeds' in parking the car.  ``Okay,
% everyone out the window.''
%
% Unable to find a movie to suit everyone, Marge suggests the kids see one
% movie while she and Homer watch something else.  Bart and Lisa dash off.
% Homer wants to see ``Look Who's Oinking'', but it's sold out, so he has
% to settle for ``The Stockholm Affair'', a highbrow political movie.
%
% Homer does every single annoying thing a person has ever done in a movie
% theater.  Meanwhile, Lisa covers her eyes while Bart thoroughly enjoys
% a gory scene from the latest Space Mutant movie.

Bart: If you don't watch the violence, you'll never get desensitized to it.
Lisa: [covering her eyes] Please tell me when the scary part's over.
Bart: [pause]  It's over.
Lisa: [uncovers her eyes]
      [the movie theater is bathed in red as we hear blood spurting]
      Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
-- Watching `Space Mutant IV', ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Homer continues being incredibly annoying, including giving away the
% ending.  The other viewers throw their food at him, and Marge bawls
% him out.
%
% On the car ride home, Marge tries to apologize, but Homer is still mad.
% Bart uses a magic marker (drawing directly on Homer's head) to illustrate.
%
% Marge, Bart and Lisa stand by the car.  Homer is still behind the wheel.
% ``I'm going now, and I don't know when you'll see me again.''  He speeds
% off.  Then comes back, hands over Maggie, and speeds off again.  Lisa
% remarks, ``I guess that executive stress ball we gave him isn't working.''
%
% Homer drives along the highway.  Billboard:  ``Flaming Pete's [picture
% of a steak] 75 miles.''  Homer continues.  The next billboard reads the
% same, but this time only ``30 miles''.  Another billboard, reading
% ``Next exit.''  Homer reaches the next exit.  Flaming Pete's has burnt down.
%
% Homer continues his long drive, trying to hold his breath as he goes past
% various smelly things.  He reaches ``The Beer -n- Brawl'' tavern.

Man 1:  Hey you, let's fight.
Man 2:  Them's fightin' words!
-- Say what you mean, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Homer tries to order a Duff, but they only serve Fudd.

Okay, Fudd me.
-- Homer orders a beer, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% The musical performer is Yodelin' Zeke.
%
% The next act is Lurleen, their waitress.  Though the bar denizens react
% poorly to the fact that drink service will stop.  Lurleen sings a song
% she just wrote, which describes Homer's current state down to the last
% detail.  Well, almost.  The song concludes, ``Your wife don't understand
% you, but I do.''
%
% After her song, Homer approaches Lurleen.  ``Your song touched me in a way
% I've never felt before.  And which way to the can?''
%
% [End of Act One]

Lurleen: So what's your name, stranger?
Homer:   Homer J. Simpson.
Lurleen: My name's Lurleen Lumpkin.
Homer:   That's a pretty name.
Lurleen: Oh, you think so?
Homer:   Maybe.  I'm not sure.  I forgot it.
-- Persistence of memory, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Homer arrives home the next morning, singing.  Homer's diction has taken
% distinctly country/western turn.  Homer sings at work, carelessly pulling
% levers back and forth.  Power cuts in and out all across town.

        [in the operating room, the power flickers]
Nurse:  Doctor, you weren't supposed to remove his gall bladder.
Doctor: Put it back!  Put it back!
-- It was like that when I got here!  ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Lenny scoffs at Homer's singing to his bowling ball, until he learns
% that Homer's bowling a 280.  Lenny gives it a shot.
%
% Homer tries to order a Fudd at Moe's Tavern, but Moe says that he thought
% it was pulled off the market ``after all those hillbillies went blind.''
% Homer says he got some at another bar, and Moe is shocked that Homer
% went to another bar.
%
% Homer drives to Lurleen's mobile home in Spittle County.

Lurleen, I can't get your song out of my mind.
I haven't felt this way since Funky Town!
-- Homer, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Homer asks for a copy, but Lurleen says they're all in her head.
% So Homer insists they ``crack open [her] head and scoop out those
% songs.''  He takes her to Lucky's Records, where Lurleen records
% her song on a CD (for 25 cents).  The clerk (Wade) says his brother
% owns a radio station in Weevilville, and Homer grants permission to
% let them play the song.
%
% The song is played on KUDD 570 AM.  The effects of the song are profound.

Moe:    [listening to a song on the radio]  For the next half hour,
        beer is on the house.
Barney: [bursts out of the men's room]  What'd you say, Moe?
        [pull back to see that the bar is otherwise empty]
Moe:    Nuthin'.
-- Trees falling in the forest, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

Krusty: [slapping Sideshow Mel]  I thought I told you to stay away from
        my sister!!
        [a song comes on the radio]
        [softens]  Oh, here's 50 bucks.  Take her to the Copa.
-- Calms the savage breast, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% The music even quells a riot at the prison.
%
% The family listen at home.

I can feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit.
-- Lisa, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

Country music sucks.  All it does is take precious air space away from
shock DJ's, whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
-- Bart the Critic, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

Marge: Who is this woman?
Homer: Well, right now, she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress,
       but she's going to be a country music superstar like...
       uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady.
-- ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Marge expresses her disapproval.

Marge, you make it sound so seamy.
All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on
some outfits.
-- Homer tries to reassure Marge, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% This fails to reassure her.  Homer answers the phone.  It's Lurleen.
% ``Uh, I think I can come over.  Lemme ask my wife.''  Marge yells
% ``Mmmmmmmm'' as loud as humanly possible.  Homer replies, ``It's a
% date.''  Homer visits Lurleen, who is immensely grateful.

Lurleen: Homer, no man has ever been this nice to me without... you know...
         wantin' sum'in' in return.
Homer:   Well, now, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now
         I feel kinda guilty about it.
-- Ask and you shall receive, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

Lurleen: [chuckles] Oh Homer, you're just a big sack of sugar.
Homer:   Hey!  [thinks on it]  You <did> say sugar, right?
-- ``(Lurleen on Me)''

Lurleen: Homer, I want you to be my manager.
Homer:   Really?!  Well, I should warn you, I'm not great with figures.
Lurleen: That's okay.
Homer:   I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Lurleen: Nobody's perfect.
Homer:   I did bad in school.
Lurleen: I didn't even go.
Homer:   My personal hygeine has been described as...
-- Is that a fair recital of my deficiencies?  ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Lurleen takes Homer to the Coruplent Cowboy, a clothing store.

Now this is made from a space-age fabric specially designed for Elvis.
Sweat actually cleans this suit!
-- Clerk at the Corpulent Cowboy, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Slightly past midnight, Marge sleeps alone in bed.  Homer finally arrives
% home, clad in traditional gaudy Western attire.  Marge is furious and
% asks him if he's having an affair.  Homer denies it, but admits under
% interrogation that Lurleen did kiss him a couple of times.  Marge forbids
% Homer to become her manager.

Homer: Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of
       managing a beautiful country singer!
Marge: Your boyhood dream is to eat the world's biggest hoagie!
       And you did it at the county fair last year, remember!?
-- ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Marge holds up a picture to illustrate.  Homer says that, whether she
% likes it or not, he's going to make Lurleen a star.  Marge snaps back,
% ``Fine.  See if I care.''  Homer leaves.
%
% [End of Act Two]
%
% Homer hands over a huge wad of cash to the man at the recording studio.

Marge: Homer, how much did you just give that man!?
Homer: Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings.  I'm not going into hock
       for this.
-- ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Lurleen kisses ``Colonel Homer'' greeting, but her reception from Marge is
% decidedly less pleasant.

Marge: Hm...  I thought you said she was overweight.
Homer: Marge, it takes two to lie.  One to lie and one to listen.
-- Tangoing optional, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% The recording session is under way, as Bart and Maggie entertain themselves
% with the equipment.  Lisa plays her sax as Lurleen sings about a baseball
% metaphor for love titled ``Bagged Me a Homer''.  But the recording has to
% stop because they're getting a grinding noise on the track.  Marge
% gnashes her teeth loudly.
%
% Lurleen becomes a hit, and the kids help with the production.  Bart slips
% the records into the sleeve, Lisa stamps the jacket, and a heavily
% lipsticked Maggie kisses it.  (Leaving lip-prints on the album cover.)

Homer:   Guess what, Lurleen.  I got you a gig on TV!
Lurleen: [squeals with delight]  Oh, Homer!  You're as smart as you
         are handsome!
Homer:   [angry] Hey!  [softens]  Oh, you meant that as a compliment.
-- ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% The TV show wants her to sing two sings, and Homer suggests she sing a new
% song.  She privately sings for him a song she just wrote ``that could really
% heat things up''.  It's titled, ``Bunk with Me Tonight.''  Homer misses
% the not-so-subtle intent.  Lurleen sings it again, a bit more pointedly,
% and it finally sinks in.  Homer makes his escape.
%
% Marge is on the phone with her sister.

Marge: All our money's tied up in this woman.  If she fails, we're broke.
       If she succeeds, I have no husband.  I don't know what to root for.
Patty: You don't?
-- ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Preparing for Lurleen's television debut, Homer struggles with his
% string-tie.  Marge notes that while Homer and Lurleen were out judging
% a greased pig contest, Maggie cut her first tooth.  But Homer isn't
% listening.  She calls in the kids, who are adorably dressed in their
% Sunday best.  ``You've got a wonderful family, Homer.  Please don't
% forget it when you walk out that door tonight.''  Homer leaves.

Much as I hate that man right now, you gotta love that suit.
-- Bart on Homer, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% The television show in question is ``Ya-Hoo!'', a spoof of ``Hee-Haw''.
% While Lurleen sings ``Bagged Me a Homer'', Homer is approached by a
% well-dressed gentleman.

I'm from Rebel Yell Records, a division of the Tokasagi Corporation.
-- ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% Homer refuses to sell Lurleen's contract.
%
% In Lurleen's dressing room, Homer asks if there's anything she needs.
% Lurleen bolts the door shut and kisses him.  Homer stops.  ``My whole
% romantic life is flashing before my eyes!''  And it does.  It involves
% lots of slapping.  Then came Marge.  Homer tells Lurleen that his goal
% was to share her voice with other people, and he's done it.  ``I'd better
% get out of here before I lose my family.''  He leaves, then pokes his
% head back in the door.  ``Just so I don't wonder.  You would've gone all
% the way with me, wouldn't you?''  She nods.
%
% Homer approaches the agent.

Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen,
and I'll take any offer.
-- Homer Simpson, Master Bargainer, ``(Lurleen on Me)''

% He sells the contract for $50.
%
% At Homer, Marge sits in bed (naked) watching the incredibly feeble
% ``Ya-Hoo!'' program.  Homer arrives home.  ``Is there any room in the
% bed for a gad-durned fool?''  ``Always has been.''  While Lurleen sings
% ``Stand By Your Manager'', Homer undresses (but keeps the hat) and gets
% into bed.  Her song concludes, ``I hope that Marge knows just how lucky
% she is.''  Marge says, ``I do'', and the two kiss.  Homer tosses his hat
% onto the camera.
