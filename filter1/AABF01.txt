% Another fall afternoon at Springfield Elementary finds Bart Simpson
% engaged in his after-school punishment.  This time, he has to write
% "The Simpsons Halloween Special IX."  Instead of the usual chalk, Bart
% chooses to write the message in blood (dipping the brush into a jack-o-
% lantern bucket when it's time for a refill).  When the bell rings, he
% tosses the brush down and gleefully runs out of the building.
%
% At home, Homer pulls into the driveway.  Bart skateboards in from the
% right, jumps the retaining wall, and bounces off the roof of Homer's
% car only to land with a thud in the driveway.  Lisa races in on her
% bike and slams into Bart's broken body.  The impact launches her from
% her bike, and Lisa is firmly lodged into the wall of the garage, just
% above the door.  Marge cheerily drives in, beeping her horn, but Homer
% is too slow in getting out of the way.  He becomes a permanent hood
% ornament for Marge's car.
%
% Meanwhile, in the Simpson living room Freddie Krueger and Jason
% Voorhees wait vainly for the family to arrive.  Freddie glances at his
% watch, and says they should have arrived by now.  Jason just shrugs
% and takes things in stride.
%
% A grim demise for the long-running series?  No, no, my friend.  It is
% only the start -- of "Treehouse of Horror IX."
%
% The curtain rises on our first macabre tale, which we call:
%
%                              Hell Toupée
%
% It's business as usual in the Kwik-E-Mart.  Snake saunters by the
% display of pocket combs.  He plucks one off the rack, dips it in a vat
% of oily cheese, and uses the concoction to slick back his hair.  The
% comb passes the audition.

Snake:    Yo, ring 'er up, dude.
          [hands Apu the comb, and then withdraws a cigarette from his
          pack]
Apu:      [gasps]  You cannot smoke in here, sir.  Please, the sign is
          clearly posted, sir.
          [points to a tiny "No Smoking" sign lost in a sea of
          cigarette ads]
Moe:      [coughs] Aw, God, you smokers disgust me.  [to Apu]  Hey,
          'Pu, you got a breakfast cereal for people with syphilis?
-- Disgust in the eye of the beholder,

% Suddenly, Chief Wiggum bursts through the front door, gun drawn.

Wiggum:   Hands up, scuzzbag!  [Moe raises his hands in surrender]
          Nah, not you, the smoking scuzzbag.
Snake:    [raises his hands, and flicks away cigarette] Yo, chill out
          dude, I'll pay the fine.
Wiggum:   Not this time, you won't; this is your third strike.  First
          you torched that orphanage, then you blew up that bus full of
          nuns ...
Snake:    Hey, that was self-defense!
Wiggum:   Well, you'll be seeing lots of nuns where you're going, pall:
          Hell!  Because the penalty for strike three is death.
          [handcuffs Snake]
Snake:    Oh, you'll never make it stick, chief.
Wiggum:   Will, too, because this place is full of witnesses -- Apu,
          that scuzzbag Moe ...
Snake:    I'm not going to forget this, dudes.  I'm going to totally
          kill both of you.
Wiggum:   And, uh, don't forget Bart Simpson.  [points to Bart, hiding
          behind a videogame]  He's a witness too, right, Barty?
Bart:     Oh...
Snake:    You are *so* dead, little dude.
Bart:     Thanks a lot, chief.
Wiggum:   [tousles Bart's hair]  Heh, ha, you kids crack me up.

%
% Homer meets with Dr. Nick Riviera at his seedy medical office.

Riviera:  Boy, you're getting the transplant just in time, Homer.

Homer:    This is legal, right?
Riviera:  [pause] Yeah, sure, whatever.
          [holds up a syringe]  These drugs will make the operation

-- Does his HMO cover that?  "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% At home, Homer shows his family their "sexy new daddy."  The family
% admires Homer's new head of lush hair.  Marge likens him to movie star
% Roger Moore -- only with his fly open.  It looks like Homer's hair
% troubles are finally behind him.
%
% Yet, a good night's rest still eludes Homer, and he tosses and turns
% in bed.  Tendrils from Snake's former hair worm their way into Homer's
% brain.  On its own, Homer's hair re-arranges itself into Snake's
% vaguely threatening style.  Homer awakes, dresses, and quietly slips
% out of the bedroom.
%
% Homer shows up at the Kwik-E-Mart.

Apu:      Ooh!  Ooh-la-la, Simpson.  What can I do for you and your new
          'do?
Homer:    [Snake's voice] You sent me to the chair.
Apu:      [gasps] Snake?  But you're dead!
Homer:    I know you are, but what am I?

% Homer, under Snake's control, picks the screaming Apu up and hauls

Wiggum    [drinking a Squishee] I'm afraid we have no leads, but I can

Lou:      [indicating Apu's legs sticking out of the top of the

%
% The next morning, Moe is just sitting down to a breakfast of Penecill-
% O's, when Homer walks in.  He picks up a corkscrew and jams it into

%
% Once again, it's up to Brockman to break the news to the town.

Brockman:      And another of Springfield's beloved citizens was
               murdered today.  Filthy old bartender Moe Syzslak has
               watered down his last highball.
Bart:          Oh, my God.  Everyone Snake swore revenge on is being
               murdered!
Marge:         It's almost as if he's killing from beyond the grave.
Lisa:          I told you capital punishment isn't a deterrent.
Bart:          Don't you get it?  He swore to kill me, too -- I'm next!
Homer:         [putting his arm around Bart] Don't worry, I'll protect
               you.  [Snake voice]  Little dude.
-- I've got a bad feeling about this, "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Homer figures the best way to save Bart is to barricade his bedroom
% door.  He nails up some boards to the door with a sledgehammer.
% "There, now no murderers can get in," Homer says.  Then, in Snake's
% voice, he adds, "or out."  Bart ducks the first swing of Homer's
% hammer, and it sails into the headboard.  The second swing finds
% Bart's Krusty doll.  The third try appears to find it's mark, but we
% see that Homer has only managed to smash Bart's school picture.
% Several more blows just barely miss their mark.

Bart:     [pounding on door]  Help!  Dad's trying to kill me!
Homer:    It's Hammer time, snitchy.  [swing and a miss, this time
          bashing a gaping hole in the door]
Bart:     That's Snake's voice!

Marge:    [interrupts] Oh, please, Lis, everyone's already figured that
          out.

% Homer closes in for the kill.

Bart:     You've got to fight the hair, dad.
Homer:    But I look so youthful and hunky.
          [Snake voice]  The kid's gotta die.
          [Homer voice]  But I love my son.
          [Snake voice]  More than a lush head of hair?
          [Homer voice]  Don't make me choose!
          [laughs with Snake's laugh]
          [Homer voice]  No!
          [Homer tosses the hammer aside.  He grabs Snake's hair, and
          tears it from his head]
          [Homer voice]  I love you, son!
Bart:     I love you too, dad.  [they hug]
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Snake may be down, but he's not out.  His hair lunges onto Bart's
% face, trying to smother him.  Homer tries to subdue the hair by
% punching it, but that does more damage to the boy than to Snake.
% Chief Wiggum, accompanied by two officers, steps into the room and
% sees Homer throttling Bart.

Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for the murders of Moe Syzslak and
Apu Nahassa ... passa ... well, just Moe, just Moe.
-- Chief Wiggum, "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Homer tells Wiggum that it was really the hair that was behind the
% murders.  Since the hair was running around the room by itself, the
% story has a certain plausibility.  The police shoot it several times
% as it tries to leap out the window, until it finally falls limp.
% Maggie picks it up and uses it as a makeshift security blanket.

Wiggum:   Now that's what I call a bad hair day.

Homer:    Going where?
-- Silly question, "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Marge goes out with Maggie, admonishing the kids to avoid "Itchy &

% It doesn't take long before Bart has had enough.  He slams the

% finds a short glowing green rod.

Lisa:     Oh, Bart, that's plutonium.  It's highly unstable!
Bart:     [forces the rod into the remote's battery slot with a hammer]
          Don't you ever get tired of being wrong?

% Bart turns on the TV.  A green ray comes from the remote and strikes
% the TV.  The feedback throws Bart back several feet onto the couch,
% and the TV itself glows and pulsates.  Nevertheless, Bart's idea works
% -- the kids can now watch "Candle in the Wound," the new I&S cartoon.
% Lisa wonders what why the TV acts strangely, and Bart figures the
% color is off.  He tries using the remote to adjust it, and adjust his
% and Lisa's color in the process.
%
% Bart and Lisa struggle over the remote.  Another ray arcs from the
% set, hits the kids, and transports them into the TV.  By the time they
% realize what happened, they are standing on the set of the "Itchy &
% Scratchy Show."

Bart:     Hey Lis, we're characters in a cartoon!
Lisa:     How humiliating.

% mouse cuts off Scratchy's head.  Then he scoops out Scratchy's brains,
% and inserts a candle in their place to make a jack-o-lantern of his

Scratchy:      Why are you laughing?
Itchy:         Hey!  They're laughing at your pain.
Scratchy:      [puts his head back on his body] That's mean.
Itchy:         Let's teach them a lesson.

Bart + Lisa:   Aaah!
-- It's not just a cartoon, darn it, "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Itchy loads a cannon with all manner of deadly objects.  Bart and

% run out of the house.  The cannon fires, and the kids have to duck to
% avoid the flying arsenal.
%
% Bart flags down a police car.  He and Lisa get in the back, and speed
% away from Itchy and Scratchy's place.  Lisa relaxes, but soon notices
% the police motto is, "To Protect and Sever."  Uh, oh -- this is Itchy
% and Scratchy's police car!  Itchy fires up a chainsaw and lunges at
% the kids, who dive to avoid the whirring blade.

% Back home, Homer notices his two oldest children are on TV.

Oooh, how are Bart and Lisa gonna get out of this one?

% Meanwhile Poochie skateboards down the street.  Those of you worrying
% that he might be making a comeback will no doubt be relieved to hear
% that I&S run him down.
%
% Inside the car, it looks like the end.  Bart has one more ace up his
% sleeve.  He draws an "eject" button on the seat of the car, and pushes
% it.  Bart and Lisa are catapulted high into the sky.  With the clouds
% rushing past, Bart reflects on their close escape.  Lisa is not so
% calm, though.  She nudges Bart to look at the ground, where Itchy and
% Scratchy (his arms now restored) lay out a pile of nasty-looking bear
% traps -- and then connect them to an electrical source.  The kids

Kodos:    [overwhelmed]  Ohh ...
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Homer's viewing of "How Dracula Got His Groove Back" is interrupted
% by a knock at the door.

Homer:    [opens door to find Kang and Kodos standing there]
          Hello -- oh great.  Mormons.
Kang:     Actually, we're Quantum Presbyterians and we've come to see
          ... my daughter.  [holds up and squeaks a squeak-toy]
Marge:    Oh, Lord.  I was hoping this day would never come.
Homer:    Huh?  What are you talking about?
Kang:     You mean you never told him?
Marge:    Oh, I guess I've been in denial.  Homer, Kang is Maggie's
          father.
Homer:    [gasps]  You intergalactic hussy!  How could you!  [covers
          his face and cries]
          [looks up]  Was he better than me?
-- Well ..., "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Marge begins to retell the tale.  One day, she was having a great
% time hanging laundry in the back yard, when Kang's spacecraft hovered
% ominously in the air.  Using advanced alien devices (like a good
% length of rope), they bring Marge aboard the ship, and sit her on a
% couch.

Kang:     Congratulations.  You have been selected for our cross-
          breeding program.
Kodos:    To put you at ease, we have recreated the most common
          spawning locations of your species.  You may choose either
          [as Kodos lists the choices, he highlights a mock-up of each
          one]
          the back seat of a Camaro,
          an airplane bathroom,
          a friend's wedding,
          or the alley behind a porno theater.
Marge:    I absolutely refuse to go along with this; [pause] but since
          I have no choice, I'll take the alley.
          [the alley set slides behind the couch.  Kang retracts his
          helmet and sits next to Marge]
Kodos:    Initiate fertilization procedure.
Kang:     Oh, you look lovely this evening.  Have you decreased in
          mass?
Marge:    [voiceover]  I tried to resist, but they applied powerful
          mind-confusion techniques.
Kang:     Look behind you.
          [Marge looks, and Kang quickly uses a ray gun to beam
          something on her]
          Insemination complete.  [deploys space helmet]
Marge:    Really?  That seemed awfully quick.
Kang:     What are you implying?
Marge:    Nothing, nothing.
Kang:     Whoa, wow, look at the time.  I'd love to stay but I have an
          early meeting tomorrow.  You're a super girl, though.  I'll
          call you sometime.
          [pushes a button marked "dump."  The couch cushion tilts up,
          and Marge falls back to Earth through a chute]

% Nine months later, says Marge, Maggie was born.  Now, Kodos wants to
% take her back to Rigel 7, where she will be given lifetime employment
% in the Rigelian civil service.  Homer refuses to give Maggie up, and
% the two begin to fight.  Bart intercedes, saying, "there's only one
% man who can settle an argument this bizarre."
%
% That one way, of course, is to go on "The Jerry Springer Show."
% Today's topic is, "My Daddy's a Space Monster!"

Springer:      Okay, we're back.  Homer, how'd it feel to learn your
               baby was fathered by a drooling space octopus?
               [Graphic comes up that says, "Homer Simpson:  'Wife
               knocked boots with Space Stud!'"]
Homer:         It made me angry, Jerry.  Angry and tired.
Springer:      Well, you're about to get a whole lot angrier, because
               we have the extramarital extraterrestrial backstage in
               the soundproof booth where he can't hear us.
Kang:          I hear all!
Springer:      Ladies and gentlemen, meet Kang.
Kang:          [walks onstage, gives Marge a bouquet of roses, and
               kisses her hand.  Homer jumps and punches him]
Homer:         You lousy two-timing [bleep bleep]!  I'm gonna [bleep]!
Kang:          Oh yeah?  Well [bleep] hyperbolic parabaloid!  [bleep]
               yo mama!  [grabs two chairs and uses them to fight
               Homer]
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Stagehands break up the fight.  Jerry takes the microphone into the
% audience to take questions.

Woman:         Yeah, I got a question for that gross thing, whatever it
               is.
Springer:      Homer.
Woman:         Nah, the green dude.  If you're that baby's daddy, where
               you been at?
               [audience voices its agreement]
               Ya know, someone needs to learn your green ass some
               responsibility.
               [audience cheers.  Kang pulls a ray gun and vaporizes
               the women]
Springer:      Now hold on, Kang.  You can't bully my audience with
               your fancy ray gun.
               [Kang vaporizes remainder of audience]
               And now for my final thought.
               [steps in front of his "final thought" backdrop]
               Nobody wins when parents put their petty squabbles above
               the welfare of a child.  Let's hope they put their
               differences aside, and do what's best for Maggie.
               [Maggie attacks Jerry]
               Ow!  What the [bleep]!  Get the [bleep] baby off
               [bleep]!  Son of a [bleep]!
               [Kang attacks Springer.  Homer attacks Kang again.  The
               show's end credit music comes up]
Marge:         I'm so [bleep] embarrassed.
-- A very special episode of "The Jerry Springer Show," "Treehouse of
   Horror"

% Kang, Kodos, and the Simpsons calmly gather outside the studio.

Marge:    I can't believe it.  Jerry Springer didn't solve our
          conflict.
Lisa:     And now he's dead.
Kang:     Anywho, this is your last chance.  Turn over the baby now.
Kodos:    Or we will destroy all your leaders in Washington.
Marge:    [knowingly] Oh, you couldn't destroy *every* politician.
Kang:     Just watch us.  [laughing menacingly, they board their flying
          saucer and take off]
Bart:     Don't forget Ken Starr!
Marge:    Suckers.
Homer:    C'mon, Maggie, let's go home.
Maggie:   Very well.  I'll drive!
          [laughs menacingly as the screen fades to black]
          I need blood.
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% The Halloween credits roll.  Instead of the normal Gracie shush, we
% hear a quick sound bite of Regis Philbin yelling, "My eyes!  My
% Beautiful Eyes!"  (Or at least we did the second time the episode
% aired.  Technical snafus prevented this from happening the first time
% around.}

% [End of Act Three.  Time:  21:48]
