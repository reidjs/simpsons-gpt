% The Simpsons family car (with luggage tied to the roof) skids to a halt
% at a scenic viewpoint.

H: Well, here we are!

% The kids raise their heads from their comics.

B: Where, Weenie Barn?
L: Yum!  I'll have a couple of jumbo corn dogs, please.

% Back to the front seats, where we see that Marge is also reading a
% magazine.

H: No, you little fools!  We're at another scenic viewpoint!
L: [disappointed]  Oh.

% The heads go back into the comics.  (Marge never raised hers.)

H: [losing patience]  Everybody out of the car.

% No reaction.

H: Now!

% A mad dash for the door.  Everybody hops out and stretches.  (Maggie
% stretches too far and falls over.)  Everybody except Bart, who leans
% against the car reading his comic book.  Homer walks over, snatches
% the comic book...

H: Gimme that!

% ... and tosses it over the cliff.  Bart watches it sail into the
% river below.

B: [disappointed] Great.  Now I'll <never> know what happened.

% Marge and the girls discover a sign that reads ``Echo Canyon''.

M: Oh, look, children.  This canyon is famous for its echo!
H: Well, whaddya know!
M: Let's take turns shouting into the canyon.  Lisa, you start.
L: Okay.  [cups her hands around her mouth]  Boooooorrrinnnnng!

% Her voice echoes through the canyon.

H: Lisa!

% Maggie tugs on Homer's pant leg.  Homer looks up and sees Bart
% carefully balanced atop a huge boulder at the top of a nearby hill.

B: Cool, man!
H: Bart!

% Bart loses his balance...

B: Whoa!

% ... and falls off the boulder, sending it crashing (*thud*) (*thud*)
% down the hill towards the car.  Homer screams.
%
% The boulder reaches the bottom of the hill and luckily bounces right
% over the family car.

H: Whew.

% Homer looks up the hill at Bart, who stands and waves guiltily.

H: Why you little...!

% Homer runs up the hill as Bart scoots off in a cloud of dust.
%
% Homer chases Bart down a trail that leads into the canyon below.

H: Bart!  (Bart... Bart... Bart...)
B: What?  (What?... What?... What?...)
H: I'm going to kill (kill... kill...) you! (you!... you!...)
B: Don't have a cow, (cow... cow...) Homer!  (Homer!... Homer!...)

% Marge and the girls watch from the scenic viewpoint.

M: That is a remarkable echo.
L: [not excited]  Whatever you say, Mom.

% Lisa and Maggie produce their magazines and resume reading.
% Marge does the same.
