% Bart strolls through a gallery of paintings.

 Bart: Paintings: lifeless images rendered in colorful goop.  But at
       night, they take on a life of their own.  They become portals to
       hell, so scary and horrible and gruesome that --
Marge: Bart!  You should warn people this episode is very frightening.
       And maybe they'd rather listen to that old "War of the Worlds"
       broadcast on NPR, hmm?
 Bart: Yes, mother.
-- There's a good boy, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Marge gives Maggie to Bart so that she can buy some earrings at the
% gift shop.

The subject of our first painting tonight is the most foul, evil,
vicious, diabolical beast to stalk the earth.  Of course I refer to...
 [Maggie stuffs her pacifier in Bart's mouth]
...mm mm-mmm!
 [Bart spits it out]
...the devil!
-- Bart, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The title "The Devil and Homer Simpson" appears in front of the
% painting, which depicts Satan's head.
%
% The scene changes to a runway.  The announcer tells of the next item
% in their fall catalogue, "A vision in raspberry cream."  A model's
% shapely legs make their way down the runway.  At the end, we see Homer
% looking up delightedly at the donut atop the legs: "Pure genius!"  He
% drools.
%
% But alas, it was all a dream.  Homer awakes to find himself at the
% power plant in front of a box of donuts.  "And now to make the leap
% from dreams to reality," he says, hungrily opening the box.  But the
% box is empty, devoid of donuts!

Lenny: Sorry, Homer.  While you were daydreaming we ate all the donuts.
 Carl: Well, there were a few left, but we chucked them at an old man
       for kicks.

-- Knockin' on heaven's door, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Homer panics a little, running back to his work station.  "Stay calm,"
% he reassures himself, "remember your training."  He reaches for the
% "Emergency Procedures" manual, and opens it up.  A square has been cut
% out of most of the pages -- a square big enough to hold a solitary
% donut.  But Homer finds no donut; all that's left is a piece of paper.
% Homer reads it.

"Dear Homer, I. O. U. one emergency donut.  Signed, Homer."
Bastard!  He's always one step ahead.
-- Homer, not realizing his own foresight, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% He contemptuously tears the note to shreds, and rues his misfortune.

   Homer: [ruefully] I'd sell my soul for a donut.
           [The devil appears, looking like Flanders]
Flanders: Heh heh, that can be arranged.
   Homer: What -- Flanders!  You're the devil?
Flanders: Ho ho, it's always the one you least suspect.
-- All those wasted years of church, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Flanders wants to ensure Homer means what he said.

Flanders: Many people offer to sell their souls without reflecting on

   Homer: [impatiently] _Do_ you have a donut or not?
Flanders: Comin' up.  Just sign here.  Careful, hot pen!
-- Desperation calls for drastic measures, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Homer signs away his soul, being careful not to burn himself on the
% flaming pen.  Burns and Smithers watch the transaction.

   Burns: Hmm...who's that goat-legged fellow?  I like the cut of his
          jib.
Smithers: Er, Prince of Darkness, sir.  He's your eleven o'clock.
-- The next installment on the billion, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The devil makes it so!  A whinnying apparition with a "Hell's Kitchen"
% apron procures a single donut for Mr. Simpson.

Flanders: Now remember, the instant you finish it, I own your soul for
          --
   Homer: [through a full mouth] Hey, wait: if I don't finish this last
          bite, you don't get my soul, do you?
Flanders: Well, technically, no, but --
   Homer: [gloating] I'm smarter than the devil!
-- I know you are but what am I?, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Flanders doesn't like Homer's gloating, and he turns into a fearsome
% beast, promising to see Homer in hell yet.  He disappears back into
% the ground in a ball of flame, but Homer's not worried.  "Not likely,"
% he giggles, putting the last little piece in his shirt pocket.
%
% That night, Homer wanders out of bed half-asleep, looking for
% something to eat.  He opens the fridge and looks at all the leftovers,
% but his eyes are drawn to the little piece of donut despite all the
% signs warning him he's not supposed to eat it.  He tosses it into his
% mouth.  "Mmm, forbidden donut."
%
% The minute he swallows it, the devil appears.  "Well, well: finishing
% something?"  A hole of fire appears in the kitchen floor, and Homer is
% drawn towards it.  He grabs onto the fridge door, clinging desperately
% to it as the suction becomes more powerful.  Marge comes in to see
% what the commotion is about, and her hair gets sucked towards the
% peephole to hell.
%
% Homer's not strong enough, and he gets drawn in.  But he gets stuck
% halfway.  "Your wide behind won't save you this time!" warns the
% devil.  Bart and Lisa walk in as well, and the devil says
% nonchalantly, "Hey Bart."  Lisa sees what's about to happen.

    Lisa: Wait!  Doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial?
Flanders: Oh, you Americans with your due process and fair trials.  This
          is always so much easier in Mexico.
-- Only until NAFTA comes in, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% But the devil acquiesces to Lisa's wishes.  He promises that the trial
% will be at the stroke of midnight, and that meanwhile Homer must spend
% the day in hell.  His trident turns into a plunger and he forces
% Homer's mass down through the floor.  Homer himself plunges down into
% the fiery abyss.
%
% He lands at the bottom on a conveyer belt.  "That wasn't so bad," he
% sighs, but he gets chopped up into little pieces with a machette by a
% demon of some sort.  His mouth, left ear, and both shoes are put in
% the "Hot Dog Meat" bin.

%
% A demon selects Homer's head from several and grips it.  He rolls it
% down an alley as Homer's head screams, until it hits the spiked pins
% and breaks open, revealing a note: "IOU one brain, signed God".
%
% Back at home, Marge looks at the phone book.

Marge: [looking at phone book] Lawyers, lawyers, lawyers...oh!  Lionel
       Hutz.  "Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free."  Hmm.
 Bart: I'd sell my soul for a formula one racing car.

% In the room with a "Hell Labs: Ironic Punishments Division" sign on
% the door, Homer is strapped into a chair with mountains of donuts all
% around.  "So, you like donuts, eh?" his keeper queries.  "Uh huh,"
% Homer answers uncertainly.  "Well, have all the donuts in the world!"
% his keeper ripostes, and a metallic machine monstrosity starts
% cramming donuts towards Homer's mouth by fours.  Eagerly he devours
% them.  {Three seconds' worth of shots of Homer eating them are cut in

%
% Much later, the machine still works overtime, and Homer has become a

% There are almost no donuts left in the room, and Homer's keeper is
% confused.  "I don't understand it.  James Coco went mad in fifteen
% minutes!"
%
% That night, in the Simpson living room, Homer appears through the

% combing his hair with a fork.

Marge: Homer!  Are you all right?
Homer: [meekly] No.
 Hutz: Mr. Simpson, don't you worry.  I watched Matlock in a bar last
       night.  The sound wasn't on, but I think I got the gist of it.
-- He learns fast, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Lionel Hutz opens the proceedings.

    Hutz: First some ground rules.  Number one, we get bathroom breaks

Blackbeard: Arr!  This chair be high, says I.
-- A tautology, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The devil begins to make his case against Homer.

I hold here a contract between myself and one Homer Simpson pledging me
his soul for a donut -- which I delivered!  And it was scrump-diddley-
umptious!
-- The Satan/Flanders beast, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

Flanders: I simply ask for what is mine!
           [He sits down smugly]
    Hutz: [cocky] That was a right-pretty speech, sir.  But I ask you,
          what is a contract?  Webster's defines it as "an agreement

%
% So the Reaper feels he has no choice but to sentence Homer to an

-- That's it?, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Marge realizes that Bart has had a nightmare, and she tries to
% reassure him.  But an air-horn blast sounding suspiciously like that

% before it hits a tree, but it explodes nonetheless.
%
% Bart's fears still aren't assuaged.  He looks out the window again,

% fire.  It gapes and loses its grip on the bus, falling off and
% bouncing down the road in a little ball of flame.  Flanders happens to

% Bart is not convinced that Mr. Burns is a vampire.  "And even if he
% was, we're not going to stumble on his secret hiding place."  But as
% he says this, he presses down on a stone-arm torch holder.  A wall
% slides back, revealing the secret location of the washer and dryer.
%
% Lisa sees reason.  "You're probably right.  Let's just go back to...
% (gasp)" In ghostly red neon lettering, she sees "TO SECRET VAMPIRE
% ROOM" on the wall, and below that, in green, "NO GARLIC" flashes.
%
% Bart and Lisa walk down the stairs into a room full of coffins.

Lisa: [motioning to the coffins] Satisfied?
Bart: Big deal.  It's no different from the basement in Grandpa's rest
      home.
-- _Those_ coffins are empty, though, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Lisa notices a tome resting on a stand, and she runs over to read the
% title: "Yes, I Am a Vampire, by Monty Burns.  Foreword by Steve
% Allen."  As she opens the book, the lids of the coffins begin to open.
% Bart tries to get Lisa's attention.

Bart: [strangled] Shee, ba-ba-ba-ba --
Lisa: Please, Bart, I've seen your stupid Shemp.
Bart: Gna-gna-gna-gna --
Lisa: Yeah, I've seen your Curly too!
-- Bart tries to warn Lisa of the walking undead, "Treehouse of Horror
    IV"

% A greenish hand rakes its claws along the page of the book she's
% reading, and she screams in fright.  The two children run frantically
% up the spiral staircase.  On the way up, Bart notices a "SUPER FUN
% HAPPY SLIDE" lever protruding from the wall, and he pulls it, figuring
% he won't be back any time soon.  The stairs change to a slippery stone
% ramp, and Bart begins his descent.  At first, he shouts "Whee!", but
% as he nears the bottom, his joy turns to fear as the arms of the
% undead reach for him.
%
% He is grabbed by an undead woman in a purple dress.  Before she can do
% anything, a bat flies into the room.  It turns into Mr. Burns, who
% grins evilly at Bart.  "Well, if it isn't little...uh, boy!" he
% cackles with glee.
%
% Lisa runs back into the dining room.

 Lisa: [breathlessly] Mom, Dad: Mr. Burns is a vampire, and he has Bart!
Burns: Why, Bart is right here.
 Bart: [droning] Hello, Mother.  Hello, Father.  I missed you during my
       uneventful absence.
Homer: Oh, Lisa, you and your stories.
       "Bart is a vampire."
       "Beer kills brain cells."
       Now let's go back to that...building...thingy, where our beds and
       TV...is.
-- The king of eloquence, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Back home, Lisa tosses and turns in her bed, unable to sleep.  When
% she hears a scraping noise at her window, she opens the curtains to
% discover that Bart is floating mysteriously outside.  She yells.

    Bart: Come join us, Lisa.  It's so cool: you get to stay up all
          night drinking blood.
Milhouse: And if you say you're a vampire, you get a free small soda at
          the movies.
-- No "cons" to vampirehood, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Lisa refuses adamantly, but Bart informs her she has no choice,
% whereupon he crashes through the window.  She screams, and Bart
% exposes her neck, his fangs growing.  Fortunately, Homer rushes into
% the room.

Homer: Bart!  How many times have I told you not to bite your sis --
       [gasps] Wait a minute!  You _are_ a vampire!
  Abe: Quick!  We have to kill the boy!  [holds a stake and mallet]
Marge: How do you know he's a vampire?
  Abe: He's a vampire?  Aah!  [runs away]
-- A true test of mettle, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% To escape, Bart turns into a bat and flies out through the window,
% laughing diabolically.

Homer, we've got to do something.  Today, he's drinking people's blood.
Tomorrow, he could be smoking!
-- Marge, concerned about Vampire Bart, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

 Lisa: The only way to get Bart back is to kill the head vampire: Mr.
       Burns!
Homer: Kill my boss?  Do I dare to live out the American dream?
-- Ethical dilemmas, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% So the family returns to Mr. Burns castle in Pennsylvania.

{This is dangerous.  I wish we could have found a sitter for Maggie...}
-- Marge, on a quest to kill Vampire Burns, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% {Homer notices the "SUPER FUN HAPPY SLIDE" lever, but Lisa warns him
% not to pull it.  Homer agrees that killing will probably be fun
% enough.}
%
% As they get to the bottom of the stairs, Lisa hands Homer a wooden
% stake and mallet, and tells him, "You must drive this stake right
% through his heart."  Homer looks over at Burns' coffin apprehensively.
% He approaches it and tears the lid off to reveal a sleeping Monty
% Burns.  "Take that, vile fiend!" he cries, hammering the stake into
% the still body.  "Uh, Dad?  That's his crotch," observes Lisa.
%
% Homer removes the stake sheepishly, and drives it into the old man's
% heart.  Burns awakes suddenly, but it's too late: he gasps and groans
% as his body melts into a puddle of flesh.  Homer sighs with relief,
% but Burns has a little life left still: "You're fired!" he yells,
% quickly melting again.
%
% At the kitchen table the next day, Lisa comments, "It's so nice having
% everything back to normal."  But Grandpa Simpson flies in, wearing a
% black cape.

I'm a vampire, and I've come to suck your blood!
 [His false fangs fall out and he crashes into the refrigerator]
Oh!  [weakly] This cape is giving me a rash.
-- Fearsome Vampire Abe, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Lisa can't understand what has happened.

 Lisa: Grandpa's a vampire?
 Bart: We're all vampires!
 Lisa: But, no!  We killed Mr. Burns --
Homer: You have to kill the _head_ vampire.
 Lisa: [points at Homer] _You're_ the head vampire?
Marge: No, _I'm_ the head vampire.  [laughs ghoulishly]
 Lisa: Mom?!
Marge: I _do_ have a life outside this house, you know.
-- Lucrative moonlighting, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The family swoop towards Lisa, hissing at her.  But then everyone
% turns to the camera and says, "Happy Hallowe'en, everybody!"  They
% begin to sing "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing" while Milhouse plays a
% miniature grand piano and Santa's Little Helper dances.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:07]
%
% The theme music over the end has an "Addams Family" motif throughout,
% and the "Gracie Films" music is different: instead of "Shh!", someone
% screams, and an organ plays the normal music but in a minor key.
