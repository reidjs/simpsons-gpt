% At Springfield Elementary, the kids are taking a break from their
% usual lessons to study fire safety.  In the playground, several pro-
% safety exhibits have been set up.  Principal Skinner mans a display of
% fire-fighting equipment and takes questions from the students.  Like,
% for example, Bart and Lisa Simpson.

Lisa:     Principal Skinner, what would you say is the most important
          fire-fighting tool?  Would you say it's prevention?
Skinner:  Oh, absolutely, Lisa.  That, and the sand bucket.
Bart:     [pointing to some of the equipment]  What's that stuff?
Skinner:  Why, this is retardant.
Bart:     [laughs]  Sure is.  Hey, what's that?  [picks up some
          equipment]
Skinner:  That's called a hose lengthener.
Bart:     [laughs]  You need one.
Skinner:  G'oh!
Bart:     What's this?
Skinner:  Just read the label.  It's a king-sized flamer!
Bart:     [laughs uproariously]
Skinner:  Bart, will you go bother someone else?
Bart:     Look!  A fire!  [Skinner looks over at Bart]
          Engine.
Skinner:  Stop that.
Bart:     Help!  Help!  Fire ... helmets.  [shows some on the truck]
Skinner:  Can't you do something constructive?
Bart:     Sure, I can do something destructive.  [runs off]
Willie:   [walking up to Skinner, and carrying a hoe]  Just say the
          word, and I'll bury this hoe in his back.  I can make it look
          like suicide.

% At another part of the school, the children -- some of them, anyway -

% to introduce the play.

Skinner:  Fire can be our servant, whether it's toasting s'mores, or
          raining down on Charlie.  But it can turn not-so-nice, as

Maude:    Mad Dog, I've been thinking.  Maybe we should get another
          smoke detector in case that one trips out on us.
Ned:      [laughs]  Why bother, baby.  One smoke detector's enough for
          Mad Dog.  Now let's hit the sack.

% tavern.  Marge sticks her head in the door, and tells her husband to
% focus on finding Bart.  Homer assures Marge he's on top of it, since
% he has a trap baited with Focusyn.
%
% But despite their efforts, the Simpsons can find neither hide nor
% hair of Bart.

Marge:    Mmmm, my sweet baby.  He must feel so helpless and scared.
          [or maybe not, for we cut to a scene of Him driving one of
          Ft. Fragg's tanks, crushing everything in his path]
Bart:     [singing] Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
          Don't stop, it'll soon be here ...
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% Burns spies Bart with his binoculars.

Burns:      Smithers, we're at war!
Smithers:   I'll begin profiteering, sir.
Burns:      And hoarding.  Leave it to the Democrats to let the
            Spaniards back in the pantry.
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% Bart drives past The Android's Dungeon, leaving a wake of crushed
% cars and signs.

Comic Book Guy: Egad -- a maniac cutting a swath of destruction!  This
                is a job for the Green Lantern, Thundra, or possibly
                ... Ghost Writer.
Otto:           Well, what about Superman?
Comic Book Guy: Oh, please.

% The tank bears down on Krusty's clown car.  With no time to drive out
% of the way, Krusty orders everyone inside to make a break for it.  In
% the best clown tradition, an entire troop files out of the tiny
% automobile.  The last guy, Sir Widebottom, gets his bottom stuck in
% the door.  The tank runs over the car, deflating Widebottom's
% inflatable posterior.  He is alive, although he wonders why.
%
% The tank bursts through the Springfield bookmobile, to the approval
% of the town's children.  The police are hot on his trail.  Wiggum
% orders Lou to shoot the tires out, but is annoyed when Lou points out
% that won't work on a tank.
%
% Bart rolls into the schoolyard at Springfield Elementary.

What a day!  First the drinking fountain squirts me, and now this.
-- Principal Skinner, after a tank plows through the schoolyard,
   "Brother's Little Helper"

% The rest of the Simpsons have also arrived at SES.  Marge stands in
% the path of the tank, in a bid to keep Bart from ramming the school.

Homer:    My God, is she brave, standing up to that freaked-out junkie.
Lisa:     Dad, that junkie is your son.
Homer:    Why don't you just tell everybody?
          [the tank comes to a halt just inches from Marge]
Bart:     Hey, Mom.  Thanks for coming out.
Marge:    Oh, thank you for stopping the tank.
Bart:     It ran out of gas.
Marge:    Oh ... so Bart?
Bart:     Question.
Marge:    How about getting out of the tank, eh?  Maybe stopping your
          rampage, eh?  We could go to Krustyburger.
Bart:     Okay, sure.
Marge:    Whew.
Bart:     Right after I blow up one thing.  [goes back inside the tank]
Marge:    Ohh ...
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% The tank's turret swivels and points its gun barrel toward the
% school.

Skinner:       [gasps]  Good Lord!  He's going to fire!
Jimbo:         All right!  Scud the school, dude!
Krabappel:     [flatly]  No.  Stop.  Think of the children.
               [the turret points toward the church]
Lovejoy:       Not the church!  Jesus lives there!
               [Bart switches aim toward a frame shop]
Homer:         The frame store!  You monster!
               [now the gun points toward the sky]
Sideshow Mel:  Not the sky!  That's where clouds are born!
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% But the sky it is.  Bart fires, and shortly thereafter a burning
% satellite crashes to the earth.  The Springfield VFD swiftly arrives
% at the scene.

Moe:      A satellite?  What do we do?  What do we do?
Ned:      [thumbs through manual]  Discotheques, Frathouses, Malibu[?]
          -- nothing about satellite fires.
Apu:      Let's just spray it with water, already.
          [does so, and puts the fire out]
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% Wiggum hauls Bart out of the tank.

Wiggum:     That's the end of your Loony Tune, Drugs Bunny.  You're
            under arrest for astro-vandalism.
Moe:        And may God help you if that thing carried the Spice
            Channel.
            [Marge walks up to the satellite wreckage, and spots the
            MLB logo]
Marge:      Major League Baseball?
Bart:       I told you they were monitoring my activities.
Lenny:      [opens the satellite, and pulls a printout from inside]
            He's right -- this thing's got info on everybody.
            Addresses, credit ratings, what size baseball hat they
            wear.
Computer:   Surveillance beam disabled.  Marketing research, shutting
            down.  Doesn't that beat all?
            [a helicopter lands nearby, and a man steps out]
McGwire:    Hi, folks!  I'm Mark McGwire.
Computer:   Big Mac himself.  Who'd have thunk it?
McGwire:    Young Bart here is right.  We are spying on you, pretty
            much around the clock.
Bart:       But why, Mr. McGwire?
McGwire:    Do you want to know the terrifying truth, or do you want to
            see me sock a few dingers?
Crowd:      Dingers!  Dingers!
            [McGwire hits the long ball]
            Oooh!
McGwire:    [takes printout]  Yoink!
            [tucks it under his hat and looks around, suspiciously]
-- Someone call Fox Mulder, "Brother's Little Helper"

% At the Simpson residence, things seem to have returned to normal.

Lisa:     [hugs Bart] It's good to have the old Bart back.  Plus, he's
          exposed the disturbing unreadiness of today's army.
Marge:    Oh, Bart, I'm so sorry we sent you on that psychotropic
          hayride.
Bart:     At least I got to see some cool colors.
Homer:    And Mark McGwire gave you an autographed bat.
          [holds up a bat, which has McGwire's signature and the number
          70 (commemorating the number of home runs he hit in one year)
          on it]
Lisa:     Why is the zero made of glass?
          [cut to a shot from behind the glass.  We can see the family
          in fisheye view.  Demographic information appears on the
          screen]
Homer:    Who cares?  That man can really slug.
          [cut to normal view]
Marge:    Well, I'm not going to give my baby any more dangerous drugs.
          From now on, it's nothing but fresh air, lots of hugs, and
          good old-fashioned Ritalin.
          [hands Bart some Ritalin]
Bart:     You said a mouthful.  [takes pills]
          [singing to the tune of "Popeye, the Sailor Man"]
          When I can't stop my fiddlin'
          I just takes me Ritalin
          I'm poppin' and sailin', man!
          [two toots of steam come out his ears]
-- He yis what he yis, "Brother's Little Helper"

% Iris out on Bart.

% [End of Act Three.  Time:  20:14]
%
% The closing sound bite is the Gracie Lady "Shh," followed by the
% first Soldier saying, "Oh why'd you have to shush?  You ruined the
% whole show."
