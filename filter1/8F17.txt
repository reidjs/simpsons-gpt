I'm going home.
-- Grampa Simpson, ``Dog of Death''

% The family take SLH to Springfield Animal Hospital, where the vet tries,
% but fails, to resuscitate a hamster with electrical heart stimulation.
% (The zapping appears to be doing more harm than good...)
% Realizing that the patient is lost, he says, ``This is the part of the
% job I hate.''  He takes the hamster and tosses it into a tiny basketball
% hoop mounted over the waste basket.
%
% Next up is SLH, which he diagnoses with a twisted stomach.  The life-saving
% operation will cost $750.  Homer says they'll talk about it as he carries
% SLH out of the examining room.  Bart constantly asks, ``What's there to
% talk about?''  In the waiting room is Krusty with a cigar-smoking chimp.
% ``Mister Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum.''
%
% On the ride home, Bart asks when SLH is going to have his operation, but
% Homer changes the subject...
% doggie heaven.

I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world:  Doggie heaven.
In doggie heaven, there are mountains of bones, and you can't turn around
without sniffing another dog's butt!
-- Homer talks to Bart when SLH falls ill, ``Dog of Death''

% Homer lists some dogs in doggie heaven.

Bart:  Is there a doggie hell?
Homer: Well... Of course, there couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
Bart:  Who's in there?
Homer: Oh, uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had, what's his name,
       um, Chester...
Lisa:  [annoyed] Checkers.
Homer: Yeah!  One of the Lassies is in there, too.  The mean one!
       The one that mauled Jimmy!
-- Are there pirates in doggie hell?  ``Dog of Death''

% Bart asks, ``Wait a minute.  Does this have anything to do with SLH?''

Marge: Honey, $750 is a lot of money.  We really can't afford this operation.
Bart:  You're gonna just let him [SLH] die?
Marge: I know you're upset...
Bart:  Darn right, I'm upset!
Marge: Bart, watch your language! ... Oh, you did.  Sorry.
-- Save it for later, ``Dog of Death''

% Bart refuses to let them let SLH die.  He leaves, grumbling, ``Lousy,

%
% Homer figures they'll get Bart a new dog, ``one with an untwistable
% stomach!''  SLH places his head in Homer's lap and whimpers pathetically.
% Homer eventually gives in.  ``Lousy, manipulative dog...''
%
% Homer pays a visit to Mr. Burns's office and asks to borrow money.
% Burns sort-of furtively summons security, who takes Homer away.

Smithers: People like dogs, Mr. Burns.
Burns:    Nonsense.  Dogs are idiots!  Think about it, Smithers.
          If I came into your house and started sniffing at your
          crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would
          you say?
Smithers: ...  If <you> did it, sir?
-- A tough question, ``Dog of Death''

% Marge catches Homer reading a Canine Surgery book and tells him he will
% not attempt the operation himself.  Homer says it's as easy as carving
% a turkey.  He then flashes back to Thanksgiving dinner, as all the
% guests shield their faces from the onslaught of lacerated turkey meat
% flying from Homer's electric knife...  He tosses the book into the
% fireplace.
%
% The family are gathered around the dinner table.  Marge says she found
% a way for them to pay for the operation, but it'll entail sacrifices.
% Homer will have to give up beer, Bart will have to get his hair cut for
% free at Springfield Barber College, Marge will forego her weekly lottery
% ticket as well as stretching the food money.

Marge: I found a way to stretch the food budget.
       Fried chicken night will now be organ meat night.
       Ham night will be Spam night.
       And pork chop night...
Homer: [whining, fearing the worst] Oh...
Marge: ... will now be chub night.
Homer: Chub!?  I don't even know what that is!
-- Neither do I, ``Dog of Death''

% Lisa won't be able to get volume 4 of Encyclopedia Generica from the

Marge: You wouldn't want what he's eating.  It's mostly just snouts and
       entrails.
Homer: Mmmmmm...  snouts...
-- ``Dog of Death''

% Kent Brockman's news report is somehow different.  Maybe it's the gold
