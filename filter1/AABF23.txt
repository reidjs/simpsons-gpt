% Before we begin tonight's show, a word from our sponsor.  The camera
% pans through shots of a city enveloped in a thick gray haze.  As
% children have coughing fits while trying to play in the schoolyard, an
% announcer grimly asks, "Is this the kind of air we want to leave for
% our children?"  Suddenly, a car pierces the smog, leaving the air
% clean and the sky blue.  The grateful kids run up for a closer look at
% the car.  Homer doesn't seem impressed at first, but the free gift in
% exchange for a test drive convinces him to make a trip to the
% dealership.

Lisa:     I'm proud of you dad!  Buying an electric car will help clean
          the air and to protect the Earth's supply of -- you're faking
          this to get the gift, aren't you?
Homer:    But I like the nice things you said about me.

% An unsuspecting saleswoman walks up.

Saleswoman:    Thinking of saying goodbye to gas?
Bart:          You betcha.  [burps]
Marge:         Bart!  [flatulent noise]  Well, that shut me up.
-- Noel Coward couldn't have done better, "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Barely able to contain his laughter, Homer tells the saleswoman that
% he's interested in purchasing one of her "electronic" cars.  She
% obligingly hands him a key, and the family goes out on their test
% drive.

Marge:    Boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier.
Homer:    Yeah, it's got a lot of other problems, too.
Lisa:     Look, Dad, you're heading for the harbor!
Homer:    Relax, we're in an electric car.
          [Homer drives off the pier, landing in the harbor.  Sure
          enough, the car is unfazed]
          See?  Everything's fine.  [gasps]  Dolphins!
          [the dolphins swim too close to the car, and are zapped]
          Oopsie.
          [a group of mermaids (!) swim up]
          Hi, girls!
          [they meet the same fate as the dolphins]
          Aw.
          [the family drives up onto dry land]
          [patting dash]  Salt water seems to be good for it.

% Homer returns the car to the sales office.  Through the window, we
% can see the family's usual jalopy parked nearby.

Homer:         Uh, I'm sorry, but the car did not meet my eco-concerns.
               Can I have my prize now?
Saleswoman:    Certainly.  [gives Homer an envelope]
               [Homer takes the envelope, runs to his car, and drives
               away.  In doing so, he reveals the Elec-Taurus, now in
               serious need of warranty work]
               What the?
Car:           Help, help!  It burns!
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Later that night, Homer and Marge are in bed.

Marge:    Hey, we never opened that envelope to see what our gift is.
Homer:    We didn't?  That's odd.  Seems like we would've done that
          right after we left the car place.
Marge:    I know, but we didn't.
Homer:    [holds up envelope]  Well, here it is, so we can open it and
          find out now.
Marge:    Perfect!
Homer:    [opens the envelope, and pulls out two movie tickets]
          Aw, movie tickets -- that hardly seems worth destroying a
          car.
Marge:    They're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring
          [gasps] Mel Gibson!
Homer:    Who else is in it?
Marge:    Who cares?  Mel Gibson!
Homer:    Mel Gibson is just a guy Marge, no different than me or
          Lenny.
Marge:    Were you or Lenny ever named Sexiest Man Alive?
Homer:    Hmmm, I'm not certain about Lenny ...
Marge:    Besides, it's not just his chiseled good looks.  "People"
          magazine says he's a devoted father, goes to church every
          week, and likes to fix things around the ... Homer, let's
          make love.
Homer:    Uh, okay.
          [the lights go out.  The lights come on]
          Uh, you're thinking about me, right?
Marge:    Of course, Homey.  Aren't you thinking about me?
Homer:    I will now.  [the lights go off again]
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% On the night of the test screening, a line forms in front of the
% theater.  There's even a pre-show:  Comic Book Guy and his *desktop*
% computer are bodily thrown out of the building.  (Seems there's a "no
% internet spy" policy in place.)  When he complains that his mouse is
% missing, it comes sailing out to join him.
%
% After the audience settles into their seats, a man in a suit comes
% onstage to address them.

Christian:     Good evening, I'm Edward Christian, assistant VP of
               Finance and Distribution at Polystar Pictures.
               [audience cheers]
Ned:           I should've brought the camera.
Christian:     Also with me tonight are the dynamic duo, William Milo
               and Robin Hannah, who green-lighted all of Shaquille
               O'Neal's movies, including "Kazaam!"
               [mixed gasps and noises of approval from the audience]
               How's the popcorn, guys?
Milo +
 Hannah:       Needs salt!  [audience laughs heartily]
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Christian welcomes the audience to the test screening of Gibson's new
% movie, a remake of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."  He explains that
% after the film, the audience is to write their opinion down on little
% cards that the filmmakers will provide.  Back at Polystar, the cards
% will be read and the movie will be changed to suit audience opinion.%

Marge:         Is Mel Gibson here?
Christian:     No, sorry, but like all celebrities, he's in Hollywood
               attending benefits for various diseases.
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% But Christian is wrong -- Mel Gibson has just sneaked quietly into
% the theater.

Gibson:   Did they like it?
Milo:     Well, they haven't seen it yet, Mel.
Hannah:   How'd you get here from L. A. so fast?
Gibson:   John Travolta flew me in his jet.  Now I have to help him
          move next weekend.  He deliberately waited until we were in
          the air to ask me.
Milo:     You know, you really didn't have to make this trip, Mel.  The
          screening's going to go fine, believe me.
Gibson:   I don't know.  I think this movie was a big mistake.  All I
          do is talk for two hours -- I don't shoot anybody.  What was
          I thinking?
Hannah:   You shouldn't worry about this movie.  William and I both
          think you're fabulous.
Milo:     And I think we know a little something about the movie
          business.  [to Hannah]  Oh, Robin, you gotta see the
          director's cut of "Booty Call."  It's fabulous.
Hannah:   What, even better than the original?  'Cause, that was pretty
          fabulous, too.
-- Uh, oh, "Beyond Blunderdome"

% We cut to Gibson's version of the stirring speech Jimmy Stewart's
% character gave near the end of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."

Homer:    Boring!
Marge:    It's not boring.  He's passionate about government.
Homer:    At least the Jimmy Stewart version had the giant rabbit who
          ran the savings and loan.
-- Homer Simpson, movie critic, "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Homer is definitely in the minority, as everyone else seemed to like
% the picture.  Even Mayor Quimby was impressed with Gibson's
% filibustering abilities.

Homer:    Well, that was a stinker.
Marge:    I liked it.  It was nice to see a movie where people solved
          their problems with words instead of bullets and chasing.
Homer:    Oh, you're just saying that because your boyfriend was in it.
          I'll bet that you would have hated it if me and Lenny was Mr.
          Smith.
Marge:    Will you stop acting so jealous?
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Mel Gibson tries to duck into the back alley to answer nature's call,
% but he triggers the fire alarm when he opens the door.  An exited
% crowd rushes up to greet him.

Gibson:     Hi, everybody!
Dr. Nick:   Hi, Mr. Gibson.
Gibson:     Thanks for coming, folks, and don't be afraid to be
            completely truthful when you fill out your opinion cards.
            Honesty is the foundation of the movie business.
Moe:        Uh, we'll be honest.  We'd could never lie to you, Mel.
Marge:      Um, will you be reading the cards yourself, Mel?
Gibson:     Well, I'll be reading yours personally.  [kisses her on the
            hand, and growls playfully.  Marge giggles and almost
            hyperventilates.]
Homer:      [pushes his way to the front of the crowd]  That's it!  I'm
            telling Mr. Stupidest Man Alive what I really thought of
            his movie.  Hey, Gibson!
Gibson:     Uh, yes, sir.
Homer:      You got a pencil?
Gibson:     Here you go.
Homer:      [grabs pencil]  Thanks.  [mutters]  Waste my time in front
            of his stupid ... [hands pencil back] Appreciate it!
            [stuffs card in Christian's coat pocket]
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% On the flight home, Christian, Milo, Hannah, and Gibson go over the
% opinion cards.  They're all rave reviews.  All, that is, but one.

Gibson:        [reading from card]  Your movie is more boring than
               church.  All you did was yak, yak, yak.  You didn't even
               shoot anybody -- Damn!  I knew it!
Christian:     Aw, don't do this to yourself, Mel.  The guy's obviously
               a nut.
Gibson:        Maybe.  Maybe he's the only person with the guts to tell
               me the truth.
-- Nah, I'd go with that first answer, "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Gibson goes to the cockpit, and tells John Travolta to divert to 742
% Evergreen Terrace.  Travolta is kind of ticked, since Gibson did help
% him to move, but turns the plane around.

% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:34]
%
% At the Simpson home, a plane roars overhead, passing so close that
% the sounds jostles Maggie around on the couch.  It subsides, and then
% the doorbell rings.  Marge opens it, and is surprised to see Mel
% Gibson.

Gibson:        I'm looking for [reads card] Homer Simpson.
Homer:         And I've been looking for you too, pal.
Bart:          Pound him, dad!
Lisa:          Bart, don't!
Bart:          Quiet!  Dad's going to get his butt kicked by Mel
               Gibson.  Knock his teeth out, Homer!
Homer:         Listen, Gibson.  I'm tired of Hollywood pretty-boys like
               you and Jack Valente thinking you can have any woman you
               want.  You see this?  [holds up Marge's hand, to permit
               close inspection of Marge's wedding ring]  It symbolizes
               that she's my property, and I own her.
Gibson:        Mr. Simpson, I need your help.
Homer:         Duh?
Gibson:        I think you're right about my movie, and I want you to
               help me make it better.
Homer:         Really?  You want my help?  Marge, did you hear that?
               Mel Gibson wants my help.  Mel Gibson!
Lisa:          Dad, I thought you hated ...
Homer:         [interrupting] Shut up.
Marge:         Homer doesn't know anything about making movies.
Gibson:        Don't sell your husband short, Mrs. Simpson.
Homer:         She's always doing that, Mel.
Marge:         Mmmm.
Gibson:        Homer is a brutally honest man.  Completely tactless and
               insensitive.
Homer:         Hee, hee.  Guilty as charged.
Gibson:        The problem I have is people love me so much, they never
               criticize me.  I speed all the time but the cops never
               give me a ticket.  If I don't pay my taxes, the IRS pays
               them for me.
Marge:         [sympathetic] Oh, you poor thing.
Gibson:        It's hell being Mel.
               [outside, the plane honks]
Travolta:      C'mon, geez!
Gibson:        I don't have much time, Homer.  Will you come to
               Hollywood with me?
Homer:         You had me at, "hello."
Gibson:        I didn't say, "hello."

% Soon the family is winging its way to Tinseltown.

Marge:    Hollywood, here we come!

          Hollywood, here we are!
Lisa:     Stop doing that, mom.

% Gibson personally drives the Simpsons to Polystar Pictures.  Homer is
% thoroughly impressed with Gibson's wheels:  A Dodge Caravan, the
% Cadillac of minivans.  (No, wait.  That was the Oldsmobile Silhouette.
% Never mind.)

Marge:    Look, they're making a movie!  Robert Downey, Jr. is shooting
          it out with the police.
          [cut to see a squadron of cops shooting it out with Downey]
Bart:     I don't see any cameras.
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Homer gives Marge and the kids some money, and tells them to go see
% the sights while he and Gibson work on the movie.  Bart wants to come
% watch, but Homer says there's too much work to do.  ("Mel's movie
% really stinks," he says in a whisper loud enough for Gibson to hear.)
%
% Gibson doesn't think Homer's suggestions to improve the movie are
% much better.  Homer suggests upping the humor quotient by running
% several scenes in fast motion.  Nah.  A musical montage where Gibson
% wears funny hats would bring out Gibson's playful side, Homer
% suggests.  Nix to that, too.
%
% Meanwhile, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie take a bus tour of
% Hollywood.

Guide:    Uh, for those of you who always wanted to see the famous
          Brown Derby restaurant ...
Marge:    Ooh!
Guide:    ... that's where it used to be.  [indicated a vacant lot with
          several drifters milling about]
Marge:    [disappointed] Oh.
Guide:    And on your left is the notorious spot where Hugh Grant ...
Marge     Ew.
Guide:    ... filmed the movie, "Nine Months."
Marge:    Eww!
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Back in the notorious spot where Homer pitched movie improvement
% suggestions to Mel Gibson ...

Gibson:   You want me to replace the villain with a dog?  I mean nobody
          will know what's going on.
Homer:    They will if you set up that the dog is evil.  All you do is
          have to show him doing this.  [lowers eyelids and glances
          around in shifty-eyed fashion]
          The people will suspect the dog.
Gibson:   Maybe this wasn't a good idea, Homer.  I'm sorry I dragged
          you out here.  Let me pay your bus fare home.
Homer:    Uh, uh, uh.  Now here's your biggest problem of all.
Gibson:   The filibuster scene?  That was Jimmy Stewart's favorite.
Homer:    And it was fine for the 1930s; the country was doing great
          back then.  Everyone was into talking.  But now, in whatever
          year this is, the audience wants action.  And seats with
          beverage holders.  But mainly action.
Gibson:   You really think it's boring?
Homer:    Oh, Mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage I've ever
          seen.  And it's not easy for me to say that.
Gibson:   Hmm.  I guess it is a little flat.  Okay, let's reshoot the
          ending.  I'll call the hair and makeup ladies, and you see if
          the Teamsters will work for free.
Homer:    Piece of cake.  Now where's that kid with my latte?
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Marge and the kids have moved on to a walking tour.  Using a map, she
% points out the house belonging to the dog from "Frasier," which is
% across the street from where Ellen Degeneres and Anne Heche live.
%
% That next day, Mel and Homer prepare to show the new, improved "Mr.
% Smith Goes to Washington."  As it begins, Gibson, as Mr. Smith, is
% nearing the end of his filibuster speech.

Gibson:   Well, I'm not licked.  I'm going to stay here and fight for
          this lost cause.  Somebody will listen to me.  Somebody will
          ... [collapses on the floor[
Payne:    I believe the Senator has yielded the floor.
Gibson:   [wakes up]  Yield this, Senator Payne.
          [throws an American flag like a javelin, striking Payne.  He
          falls on his desk, the flagpole now standing upright]
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Gibson grabs two other senators and slams their heads inside two
% desks.

Gibson:   I move, we impose some serious term limits.
Homer:    [from the press gallery]  I second that motion.  [holds up a
          rifle]  With a vengeance!  [tosses rifle to Gibson]
-- Why didn't Jimmy Stewart think of this?  "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Catching the rifle, Gibson jumps up on a table and quips, "All in
% favor, say die."  Then, spinning around on a table like Curly, the
% guns down most of the senators.  The Senate leader complains that
% Gibson's actions are "highly unorthodox," and pounds a gavel.  Gibson
% throws a fire extinguisher under the gavel, and when the leader hits
% it, it explodes.  The explosion fills the building with smoke, and
% sends the statue on top of the Capitol Dome into the river.
%
% Just then, an aristocratic man storms in and identifies himself as
% the President of the United States.  He demands to know what all the
% commotion is about.  Gibson rips the National Seal down from the wall,
% and tosses it at the President, slicing off his head.  The head lands
% at Gibson's feet.  He picks it up and grimly says, "Happy birthday,
% Mr. President."  A crowd of happy schoolchildren bursts in and carries
% Gibson off, cheering.  Gibson takes his badge, and throws it into the
% dead Payne's hand.  Payne's hand clutches it, and then relaxes.  The
% lettering on the badge is changed to, "The End."
%
% The lights come up in the screening room.

Gibson:        Pretty cool, huh?
Christian:     You, uh, you chopped off the President's head.
Gibson:        Bet you didn't see that coming.
Hannah:        You impaled a United States Senator with the American
               flag.
Milo:          Why did Mr. Smith kill everybody?
Homer:         It was symbolism.  He was mad.
Christian:     But this was going to be the studio's prestige picture,
               like "Howard's End" or "Sophie's Choice."
Homer:         Ugh.  Those movies sucked.  I only saw them to get Marge
               into the sack.  [sotto voce]  P. S.:  Mission
               accomplished.  [high-fives Gibson]
Christian:     But we already bought five Golden Globe awards.
Gibson:        I don't make movies to win awards.  [holds up two Oscar
               statuettes; speaks in sotto voce]  Especially now that I
               have two Oscars.  [normal voice]  I make movies for guys
               like him.
Homer:         Yeah, guys like me.
Christian:     Who are you, anyway?
Homer:         Do the words Executive Producer mean anything to you?
Gibson:        Executive Producer?
Homer:         We'll talk.
Christian:     [takes film off the projector]  You desecrated a classic
               film.  This is worse than "Godfather III."
Gibson:        Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa!  Let's not say things we can't
               take back.
Christian:     All right, all right, I'm sorry.  But this film is never
               going to see the light of day.  [takes a lighter to the
               film, intending to set it aflame]
               [Gibson and Homer gasp]
Gibson:        [pointing out the window] Look -- they're towing away a
               Range Rover.
               [Christian, Milo, and Hannah run to the window to look]
Hannah:        There's no --
Gibson:        [grabbing film] Yoink!  C'mon Homer, we've got a movie
               to premiere.
Homer:         Woo hoo!  [Gibson and Homer beat a hasty retreat]
Christian:     We've got to get that film back or we're all going to

-- They're a pretty smart bunch, "Beyond Blunderdome"

% It turns out that Homer and Gibson are hiding out in a museum of

          Quick, Mel, get in!
Gibson:   [sighs] Forget it, Homer.  Let's just give them the stupid
          movie.
Homer:    Movies aren't stupid.  They fill us with romance and hatred
          and revenge fantasies.  "Lethal Weapon" showed us that
          suicide is funny.
Gibson:   That really wasn't my intention.
Homer:    Before "Lethal Weapon 2" I didn't know there could be a bomb
          in my toilet, but now I check every time.
Marge:    It's true, he does.
Gibson:   Do movies mean that much to you, Homer?
Homer:    They're my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.

% that it is Lisa -- to take the wheel.  The next thing we see is Gibson
% leap off the car.  He bounces off the executives' car and lands on the
% pavement, where several more cars run over him.
%
% Christian, who was driving, immediately concocts an alibi.  ("You all
% saw it -- he came at me with a knife, right?")  The excuse isn't
% needed, for the "body" that was run over was just the dummy Mel from
% the museum.  The execs resume the chase.
%
% Homer abruptly stops the "Mad Max" car, and announces that it's time
% they made a stand.  We switch back to the executives' point of view as
% they drive down the street to see ... Gibson and Homer mooning them.

Milo:     Who the heck is that?
Hannah:   Well, the one on the left is Mel Gibson.  I don't know who
          the other two guys are.

% Gibson is having second thoughts about this strategy.

Gibson:   Will you please tell me the rest of the plan?
Homer:    It was your plan, from "Braveheart."  Your army mooned the
          enemy until they could take no more and surrendered.
Gibson:   No!  They didn't!  They attacked us in a horribly bloody
          battle.  Remember?
Homer:    Actually, I didn't see it, but on the poster it --
Gibson:   [interrupting] Jump!
          [Gibson leaps out of the way, but Homer is struck square in
          the rump]
          Homer, are you okay?
Homer:    I think so.  [walks a few steps, dragging the car along with
          him]  No.

% The executives have apparently relented, because the movie -- revised
% ending and all -- is released to the public.  The reaction confirms
% the studio's worst fears.  Not only did the audience hate it, but
% Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter threatens to sue.  Homer regrets not
% including the shifty-eyed dog.
%
% Outside the theater, Gibson and Homer try to recover from the
% evening's debacle.

Homer:    Aw, I'm sorry I ruined your career, Mel.
Gibson:   It's not your fault, Homer.  I guess there's no room in
          today's crazy, gentle America for violent dinosaurs like us.
Homer:    How did the country lose its way, Mel?  When did we stop
          rooting for the man with a flame-thrower or an acid-spraying
          gun of some kind?
Gibson:   I blame the internet.  And the return of swing music.
Homer:    Well, whatever it is, we gotta get rolling on our next
          picture.  Hey, what about a prequel of something?  Everybody
          loves prequels.
Gibson:   I don't.
Homer:    [exasperated sigh] Okay, Mr. Difficult.  How about a teen sex
          romp, where you and your buddies are always trying to get
          some.  No, wait!  A ghost who wins the lottery.  [Mel and
          Homer get into a waiting limousine]  You can be the ghost, or
          the lottery commissioner.
          [the limo drives off]
          Ooh!  What about Indiana Jones?  Does anyone own the rights
          to that?
          [the limo door opens, and Homer is tossed onto the street]
          Hey Mel!  I fell out!
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% The camera pans back to the theater.  A lone dog with an evil, shifty-
% eyed, expression sits in front of the building.  Hmmm ... perhaps this
% was his doing all along.  The screen fades to black, and we hear a
% howl.
%
% The End, at least until the sequel.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time:  20:28]
%
% The closing sound bite is Gibson's Curly-like, "Woo woo woo!"
