-- Barney's short-term memory, "A Star is Burns"

% Barney's movie is in black and white.  It opens with a shot of a Duff
% beer bottle on a windowsill.  Gauzy white curtains billow around it as
% the love theme from "M.  Butterfly" plays.  A hand grabs the bottle
% and turns it upside down; the camera pans slowly down to reveal
% Barney's lips on the other end of it.
%
% The next shot shows Barney from above lying on a couch under the
% window.  As a voiceover, he says, "My name is Barney Gumbel.  I'm 40,
% I'm single, and I drink."  The scene fades to a road where Barney lies
% in the gutter, drinking another Duff, then lying down.  The Duff pours
% slowly into a sewer grating.  "There's a line in `Othello' about a
% drinker: `Now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
% beast.'  That pretty well covers it."  The camera shows a time lapse
% view of clouds moving during the day, which turns to night, then back
% to day again.  Barney has become an old man, bald, toothless, still
% lying in the same gutter.  A tear leaks from his eye.
%
% A woman watching the movie is moved.

 Woman: It's brilliant: savagely honest, tender...he has the soul of a

 Woman: Excuse me, did something crawl down your throat and die?
Barney: It didn't die!
-- Methinks the man doth protest too much, "A Star is Burns"

% Back on the screen, Barney sits in a chair and says, "My name is
% Barney Gumbel, and I'm an alcoholic."  The camera pulls back to reveal
% several similarly-attired girls.  Lisa says, "Mr. Gumbel, this is a
% Girl Scout meeting."  Barney asks, "Is it?  Or is it that you girls
% can't admit you have a problem?"
%
% The scene fades to a playing record player, then back to Barney on the
% couch, a rose held to his nose.  "Don't cry for me," he narrates, "I'm
% already dead."  He puts the rose in the Duff bottle on the windowsill;
% its petals fall off slowly, and the curtain billows in front of it as
% "Fin" appears.
%
% Everyone applauds wildly; Marge blows her nose.  "I think we have a
% winner," says Jay.  Homer walks in holding a beer and asks, "What'd I
% miss?"  Marge chides him, "Homer, please pay attention!  There's just
% one more movie."  That movie is "A Burns for All Seasons", starring
% Montgomery Burns as Montgomery Burns, Bumblebee Man, and Tommy Tune as
% "Smithers".  The title sequence features the picture from the Sistene
% Chapel of God touching Adam's finger, except instead of Adam, it's
% Burns.  A long list of writers scrolls by, ending with Lowell Burns
% and Babaloo Smithers.
%
% The first scene opens with Mr. Burns atop a horse wearing a sombrero,
% rounds of machine gun ammunition draped across his chest.  "Simple
% villagers," he says to a group of people, "I promise you I will close
% plants in America and bring work here!"  Chespirito cries, "Viva Senor
% Burns!" and the assembled villagers cry, "Viva!  Viva!"  Burns' horse
% gallops off, but Burns doesn't manage to stay in the saddle, instead
% getting dragged back and forth along the ground.  In the audience,
% Burns laments, "We did twenty takes, and _that_ was the best one."
%
% The next scene features Mr. Burns saying, "Remember, Elliot, I'll be
% right here," on one knee to a child.  The tip of his finger lights up
% briefly; he then enters a spaceship, its door spiraling closed, which
% takes off into the crimson sky.  The audience murmurs angrily among
% themselves, "Pure egotism!  Self-indulgent tripe," and the like.  "I
% don't care what they say," vows Burns, "I'm going to win this
% festival!"
%
% The next scene shows a Roman centurion on a horse leading a group of
% shackled prisoners across the desert.  The last prisoner, who bears a
% striking resemblance to Charlton Heston, collapses from exhaustion.  A
% shadow appears over him: a man kneels in front of him, strokes his
% hair, and hands him a bottle of spring water.  "Drink up, Judah Ben
% Hur," exhorts Mr. Burns.  Ben Hur does so, then looks up gratefully
% and says, "You truly are the king of kings."  A heavenly light shines
% down upon Burns, and he says "Excellent."  The movie ends.

Audience: Boo!  Boo!
   Burns: Smithers...are they booing me?
Smithers: Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns!  Boo-urns!"
   Burns: Are you saying "boo" or "Boo-urns"?

       heads.
Homer: Good idea, Marge: my mind is going a mile a minute.
        [inside Homer's head, one monkey picks fleas off another]
-- Homer, still a primate, "A Star is Burns"

% Marge rues her decision to put Homer on the judging committee.

 Marge: I knew this would happen.  I put you on the jury and you vote
        for the stupidest film.
 Homer: I have every right to be on that jury, even though I got there
        because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
   Jay: How many times have I heard Rex Reed say _that_?
 Homer: Oh, great, now _you're_ going to make fun of me!
   Jay: No, Homer, I won't make fun of you.  But I will suggest there
        may be better things in life than seeing a man get hit in the
        groin with a football.
         [a football hits Jay in the groin]
Nelson: [off-camera] Ha ha!
 Marge: Well, Homer?
 Homer: Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do.
         [inside his head, two monkeys do calculus on a blackboard]
-- Homer, still a primate, albeit an advanced one, "A Star is Burns"

% Homer watches Barney's movie again to make his final decision.

 Homer: [thinking] Hmm...Barney's movie had heart, but "Football in the
        Groin" had a football in the groin.
Barney: [on the screen] Don't cry for me, I'm already dead.
 Homer: Wow.  I'll never drink another beer.
   Man: Beer here!
 Homer: I'll take ten.
-- "Never" meaning "right away", "A Star is Burns"

% The audience reassembles for the final announcement.  Jay announces,
% "And now to announce the winner.  The award for outstanding animated
% short goes to...Itchy and Scratchy for their film, `Four Funerals and
% a Wedding'."  Scratchy stands with his bride in front of a priest when
% Itchy runs on and abducts her.  He replaces her with a similar-looking
% bride made entirely of bombs and dynamite, their fuses burning.
% Scratchy kisses her blithely, wipes her mouth blithely, then lives the
% rest of his life blithely, producing children that are also made of
% bombs and dynamite.  In his old age, he sits with his bride in an old
% folks' home when she finally explodes, turning he and his rocking
% chair into charred skeletons.  A bearded Itchy walks up to point and
% laugh, but the exertion gives him a heart attack and he keels over.
% The audience, of course, laughs.

   Jay: And now, the winner of the grand prize.  [tears open an
        envelope] Barney Gumbel!
Barney: What?  Wow!
 Burns: [shudders]
 Marge: Homey, you voted for the right movie.  I'm glad you were on the
        jury.  [kisses him]
 Homer: Aw.  You know something, Marge?  It's not that tough being a
        film cricket.
Barney: [at the podium] I've learned I have a gift to share with the
        world.  From now on, there'll be a new Barnard Gumbel:
        hardworking, clean, and sober.
Quimby: Congratulations, Barney, and enjoy your grand prize: a lifetime
        supply of Duff beer.
Barney: Huh?  [pulls up sleeve] Just hook it to my veins!
-- Even the greatest idol has a few vices, "A Star is Burns"

% The Simpson family take Jay to the airport to see him off.

 Lisa: Goodbye, Mr. Sherman.  If I ever play Carnegie Hall, I'll give
       you a call.
  Jay: And if you ever want to visit _my_ show --
 Bart: Nah, we're not going to be doing that.
Marge: Well, Jay, I hope you tell your New York friends that people in
       small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think.
Homer: Marge, look!  This has spring snakes inside but the suckers will
       think it's beer nuts.  [laughs] Mmm...beer nuts.
        [opens jar; spring snakes fly out] Aah!  D'oh!
-- Not _all_ people, that is, "A Star is Burns"

  Marge: Well, it was a lovely festival.  The best movie won, and Mr.
         Burns found there are some awards that can't be bought.
          ["Six months later"]
Rainier: And the Oscar goes to...
  Burns: I've got to win this one!  I bribed everyone in Hollywood.
Rainier: ...George C. Scott in "Man Getting Hit By Football".
          [everyone applauds; Burns steams]
          [a screen shows George C. Scott standing there and a football
         hitting him in the groin]
  Scott: [doubling over] Aargh!  My groin.
-- Hollywood's new integrity, "A Star is Burns"
