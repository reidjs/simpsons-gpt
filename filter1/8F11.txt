% Homer finds Lisa dancing provocatively in front of the television.  She's
% watching a TV dance show, laden with pretty young girls dancing the same
% way.  Homer drools at the girls (reflected not only in his eyes, but
% also in his drool).

Lisa:  Dad, can I have some money to buy Bart a birthday present?
Homer: [entranced by a TV show of pretty girls dancing provocatively]
       Mon-ney.  [hands over a huge wad of bills]
Lisa:  [riffles through it]  Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars!
Homer: Oh, sorry.  [gives her the entire wallet]
-- Ask, and you shall receive, ``Radio Bart''

`Funky-See Funky-Do' will be right back to lip-sync another of their
hits, right after this...
-- Announcer on TV music dance show, ``Radio Bart''

% Lisa leaves to go shopping, and a commercial comes on.  It's for one of
% those microphones that acts as a mini radio transmitter.  The commercial
% is your usual shameless plug, and Homer gobbles it, hook, line, and
% sinker.  Homer decides to buy it for Bart's birthday.

Announcer: ... But order now.  Supply is limited.
Homer:     Gasp!  Limited!?!?  [frantically dials the phone]
           Do you have any of those microphones left?
Clerk:     [standing in a warehouse filled to the roof with boxes
           of microphones]  Yeah, a couple...
-- A couple thousand, perhaps... ``Radio Bart''

% In bed, Homer tells Marge that this time, perhaps he will succeed at
% purchasing his son's affections.
%
% It's Bart's birthday.  Homer marks Bart's height on the wall.  (All the
% marks are zig-zagged, being outlines of Bart's spikey hair.)  Bart tunes in
% the Krusty the Klown Show in time to watch the birthday announcements.
% Sideshow Mel brings out a giant birthday cake, and Krusty trips him.
% Mel lands on his face, but the cake is intact.  As Mel gets up, Krusty
% kicks him in the butt, sending him headfirst into the cake.  Mel's
% hair catches fire on the candles.  (Later, we see Mel running frantically
% in the background, his hair still afire.)
%
% Krusty says it's time to see the names of the birthday boys and girls,
% and Bart watches his name scroll past (along with two dozen other names)
% at lightning speed.  ``Wow, best eight bucks I ever spent.''  Marge tells
% Bart that Grampa is on the phone to wish him a happy birthday.  ``Take a
% message.''  Bart brandishes a handful of 46 coupons for birthday goodies
% and heads out.
%
% First stop is a free birthday sundae at Phineas Q. Butterfat's.  The
% clerk gives Bart a tiny teaspoon-sized sundae.  Next is a free shave.

Bart:   [in the barber shop, getting a shave]
        Digital audio tape, my butt!  When <I> was a kid, we had compact
        disks, and <I> don't recall no one complaining.
Barber: Damn right.
-- Bart's free shave, ``Radio Bart''

% Bart then gets his free tango lesson.  Although half the height of his
% partner, Bart dances divinely.  Bart excuses himself to go to his
% birthday party.  (``Farewell, Senor Bart,'' sighs Rosarita.)
%
% Bart arrives at the birthday party and greets his guests.

Hey, good to see you.
Glad you could make it.
Toby, have you lost weight?
-- Bart, the perfect host at his birthday party, ``Radio Bart''

% The kids harrass Wall E. Weasel, who is trying to deliver a pizza.
% Bart busies himself with a video game.  Later, he `talks' with the
% mechanical entertainment, which performs a birthday song.  (The
% lyrics sing to the `birthday boy or girl'.)  Until it catches fire,
% at least.
%
% Bart's first birthday gift is from Selma.  It's a label-maker.  Bart is
% hardly amused.  The other gifts are equally boring.  Homer gives Bart the
% radio microphone, but Bart merely calls, ``Next.''  Martin gives Bart a
% matching jacket and beret, identical to his own.
%
% Having nothing better to do, Bart labels everything in the house
% ``Property of Bart Simpson'' (including SLH).  Homer opens the fridge...

Oh, there's only one can of beer left, and it's Bart's.
-- Homer finds a `Property of Bart Simpson' sticker on a can of Duff,
   ``Radio Bart''

% Homer asks Bart how the microphone is working, to see it being used
% to prop the window open.  ``Bart, I would love to get a present like
% that.''  Bart hands it over.  ``Here you go.  Enjoy.''  Homer demonstrates
% the microphone, singing the song that was sung on the TV commercial,
% blasting his melodious voice out Lisa's radio.  Lisa covers her ears.
% (SLH howls in agreement.)
%
% He then makes an announcement for Marge over her radio, but she couldn't
% understand him because of the distortion.  Homer realizes his gift was
% a flop.
%
% In his room, Bart grouses, ``What a crappy birthday.''  Marge comes in
% and tells him the radio microphone isn't so bad.  She demonstrates.
% ``Testing, testing, one two three. ...  Oh my, do I sound like that?''
% Bart decides it might not be a total loss after all.
%
% Downstairs, Homer opens the freezer and pulls out a box of Neapolitan
% ice cream, to find that the chocolate is completely gone.  (The vanilla
% and strawberry are untouched.)  He pulls out a second box, with the
% same result.  ``Marge, we need some more vanilla, chocolate and
% strawberry ice cream!''  The radio crackles to life.

People of earth, this is Bartron, commander of the Martian invasion force.
Your planet is in our hands.  Resistance is useless.
-- The first broadcast of ``Radio Bart''

% Only after he fetches a shotgun does Homer realize that it was Bart.
% ``Why you little...''  But he stops his strangling when he realizes
% that this means Bart actually <liked> his gift after all!  He makes
% Bart promise not to play any more practical jokes, and Bart agrees.
% (Bart surreptitiously slaps a ``Property of Bart Simpson'' label on
% Homer's butt.)

% [End of Act One.  Time: 6:41]
%
% Marge puts Maggie to bed and removes her pacifier.  As Marge turns
% to leave, we hear Maggie say, ``Mama!  Mama!''  Marge is amazed,
% then discovers a small radio hidden behind Maggie's pillow.
%
% Bart hides his microphone under Lisa's bed and uses it to snoop in
% on her conversation with one of her friends.
%
% In school, flatulent noises are heard when Ms. Krabappel sits down.
% Ms. K discovers the radio under her chair.
%
% Bart spots Rod and Todd sitting in their room listening to the radio.

Bart: [over the radio] Rod!  Todd!  This is God!
Rod:  How did you get on the radio?
Bart: Whaddya mean, how did I get on the radio?  I created the universe!
      Stupid kid.
Todd+Rod: [fall to their knees and clasp their hands]
Todd: Forgive my brother.  We believe you.
Bart: Talk is cheap.  Perhaps I'll test a guy's faith.  Walk through the
      wall!  I will remove it for you.
Rod:  [walks into the wall]  [thud]
Bart: Ha ha ha.
Todd+Rod: [return to their knees in prayer]
Todd: What do you want from us?
Bart: I got a job for you.  Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen
      and leave them on the Simpsons' porch.
Rod:  But those cookies belong to our parents.
Bart: Ugh!  Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?
Todd: [quickly]  Happy God.
Bart: Then quit flapping your lip and make with the cookies!
Todd+Rod: Yes, sir!

% Bart twirls his microphone and blows across it, as if it were a
% six-shooter.
%
% Bart lowers his portable radio on a rope down a well, but he loses his
% grip, and it falls to the bottom.  Groundskeeper Willie hears a plaintive
% ``Help!  Help!'' coming from the well.  He takes a swig from his liquor
% flask and runs through traffic, returning with his plow.  Bart
% chuckles, ``Sucker!''
%
% Word travels quickly through town, and before you know it, the well
% is surrounded by the police, curious onlookers, and Kent Brockman.
% Bart identifies himself as Timmy O'Toole, an orphan who was turned
% away from Springfield Elementary by Principal Skinner on account of
% his shabby clothes.  Skinner denies this accusation.

The circumference of the well is 34 inches, so, unfortunately, not
one member of our city's police force is slender enough to rescue the
boy.
-- Kent Brockman's report, ``Radio Bart''

% (During Kent's report, we see Eddie bring a box of donuts from the
% food stand.  The other cops are already munching away.)  Chief
% Wiggum scolds his men, and when asked why <he> doesn't go down,
% he says, ``Well, I'm too... important.''
%
% Kent explains that Timmy's foot is caught under a rock, so they
% can't simply pull him up, lest he become injured.
%
% A falconer explains that his bird will fly the boy to safety.
% He releases the bird, which flies away, never to return.
%
% A man shows a fishhook and a bar of chocolate.  ``And then I'll
% clean him for free.''

Although we can't reach the boy, we <can> freeze him with liquid
nitrogen, so that future generations can rescue him.
-- Dr. John Fink's plan to rescue poor Timmy O'Toole, ``Radio Bart''

% The Simpsons sit on the TV couch, metal trays set up in front of them.

Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from Your bounty...
-- Marge's TV dinner prayer, ``Radio Bart''

% Marge asks the Lord to keep an eye on poor Timmy, and Bart laughs.

Homer: That Timmy is a real hero!
Lisa:  How do you mean, Dad?
Homer: Well, he fell down a well, and... he can't get out.
Lisa:  How does that make him a hero?
Homer: Well, that's more than you did!

% On TV...

Channel 6's own Krusty the Klown has gathered members of the entertainment
community, who normally steer clear of fashionable causes...
-- Kent Brockman's news report, ``Radio Bart''

% Kent Brockman interviews Krusty regarding his new project, a video
% called We're Sending Our Love Down the Well.

I called my good friend Sting.  He said, ``Krusty, when do you need me?''
I said, ``Thursday.''  He said, ``I'm busy Thursday.''
I said, ``What about Friday?''  He said, ``Friday's worse than Thursday.''
Then <he> said, ``How about Saturday?''  I said, ``Fine.''  True story!
-- Krusty makes his music video, ``Radio Bart''

% Kent interviews Sting and Krusty, then we see the resulting video.

Sting:  There's a hole in my heart as deep as a well for that poor little boy,
        who's stuck halfway to Hell...
Sideshow Mel: Though we can't get him out, we'll do the next best thing...
McBane: We go on TV and sing, sing, sing!
All:    And we're sending our love down the well...
Krusty: All the way down!
All:    We're sending our love down the well...
Krusty: Down that well!
-- Krusty's music video, ``Radio Bart''

% Kent asks Krusty what he's going to do with the royalties.  Krusty explains
% that first, they have to pay for promotion, shipping, distribution, the
% limos they rented...  Whatever's left over, they throw down the well.
%
% The field around the well has turned into a Timmy O'Toole amusement park.
%
% Lisa watches another ridiculously violent Itchy and Scratch cartoon,
% this one with a well theme, and dedicated to Timmy O'Toole.  Meanwhile,
% SLH has gotten his hands, er, mouth on Bart's microphone, and growls
% emerge from the well.  The cartoon is interrupted for a special report,
% and Kent asks Dr. Marvin Monroe for an explanation.  Monroe explains that
% the child is returning to a feral stage.  He shows an artists's conception,
% which looks like a young wolfman.  Lisa sees Bart struggling to
% recover the microphone and puts two and two together.  Bart finally gets
% the mike and explains (in his Timmy voice) that he was trying to chew his
% foot off, then pretends to go to sleep.  Lisa tells Bart that when the
% townspeople realize that it was a hoax, they're going to want to kill him.
% Bart asks how they'll find out.  Lisa says, ``I bet you were stupid enough
% to have left a `Property of Bart Simpson' label on that radio.''  We take
% a wild ride through Springfield, down the well, and focus on the label
% Lisa described.  (Bart:  ``D'oh!'')
%
% That evening, the two cops read the Cinderella story down the well for
% Timmy, then go for a coffee break.  While they're gone, Bart ties a rope
% to a tree stump and rappels down the well.  (He's wearing a flashlight
% taped to his lucky red hat so he can see where he's going.)  The cops
% return, and Eddie says, ``Hey, I almost tripped over this thing,'' and
% unhooks the rope from the stump.  Bart screams as he falls...

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:27]
%
% Bart lands with a thud at the bottom of the well.  Poetically enough, his
% foot is trapped under a rock.  (``What did I do to deserve this?'')
% Bart yells for help and admits to his practical joke.  The cops decide
% to pull their own prank:  They leave.
%
% The two cops tell Homer and Marge that Bart is trapped down the well.
%
% Homer and Marge pay a visit to the well, which has drawn a small crowd.

Don't worry, son.  Just 'cuz you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you
can't live a rich and full life.
-- Homer's reassuring words, ``Radio Bart''

% Homer tosses down Bart's Krusty doll, which lands on Bart's head.  Bart
% complains, ``Ow!  Knock it off, you bald boob!''  Homer threatens, ``Hey,

%
% Chief Wiggum says they've located a piece of machinery in Shreveport,

Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well.  If he'd done it

-- Chief Wiggum tells Marge it's all in the timing, ``Radio Bart''

% Kent interviews Homer and Marge...

Kent:  The time has come for finger-pointing, and most of them are
       squarely aimed at the boy's parents.
Homer: It's not our fault!  We didn't want the boy, he was an accident!
Marge: Homer!
Homer: Uh...  Could you edit that last part out?
Kent:  Mr. Simpson, we're live, coast-to-coast.
Homer: D'oh!

% Marge and Homer pay a late-night visit to the well.

Marge: Bart honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're

Bart:  Mom, it's too big.
Homer: Don't worry, you'll grow into it.
-- Bart is trapped in a well, ``Radio Bart''

You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years.
