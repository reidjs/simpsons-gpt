% Homer has just stepped out of the shower when Marge calls
% "breakfast," that he loses his towel in the rush downstairs.  Lucky
% for rest of the family, he's fully dressed by the time he's seated
% at the table.  But the family's not so lucky when it comes to the
% breakfast menu.

Homer:	Aw, cereal?  You know I like my breakfast fried, or 
	chicken-fried.
Marge:	It's that healthy cereal from Europe.  Meuslix.
	[spoons some from the bowl; it's viscous beige glop]
	[the children shudder simultaneously]
	They also make juicelix.
	[Maggie takes a drink from her cup.  The same gooey cereal 
	forms a messy strand between her face and the bottle]

Bart:	It's Milhouse.
	[the doorbell rings several more times]
	And it sounds like he has big news!  [runs out of the 
	room]
Homer:	[spooning his cereal] Yugh.
Lisa:	Yuch.  [aside to Homer] I'll get us out of this.
	[louder] Say Dad, wanna go see my project for the school 
	science fair.
Homer:	[winks] No, Lisa.  But I sure don't want to eat this 
	crappy breakfast.  [Lisa and Homer run out of the room, 
	leaving Maggie trapped in juicelix like a tar baby]

% Lisa shows her father her science-fair project, a little homemade
% robot.

Lisa:	Meet Linguo, the grammar robot.  I built him all by 
	myself.  If you misuse language, he'll correct you.
Homer:	Well, let's put him to the test.  [slowly] Me love beer.
Linguo:	*I* love beer.
Homer:	Aw, he loves beer.  Here, little fellow.  [pours a handy 
	can of beer in Linguo's mouth]
Lisa:	Dad, no!
Linguo:	[shorting out] Error.
Homer:	I'm sorry.  I thought he was a party robot.

	takes Linguo and goes upstairs]

% Homer catches a whiff of something good and follows the scent to the
% kitchen.  Marge is making brownies for after dinner.  Homer wants
% one now, and playfully makes several grabs at them while Marge tries
% to cut them into smaller squares.
%
% You know how they say you shouldn't fool around with sharp knives? 
% Homer discovers there's a good reason for that:  Marge accidentally
% severs his right thumb.

Homer:	Oh God, Oh God, Oh God!
Marge:	I'm sorry!  I'm so sorry!
Homer:	Sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, Marge!
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Marge quickly bandages Homer's hand, and tells him that if they can
% get to the hospital quickly enough, the doctors can re-attach it. 
% That may be easier said than done.  In the confusion, Santa's Little
% Helper has nabbed Homer's thumb.  Homer tries tackling the dog, but
% he misses, and SLH runs out through the doggie door.  Homer gives
% chase.
%
% Meanwhile, Marge calls 911.

Wiggum:	[answering phone] 9-1-1.  This'd better be good.
Marge:	I cut off my husband's thumb!
Wiggum:	Attempted murder?  You'll burn for this -- burn in jail!
Marge:	It was an accident.
Wiggum:	Yeah, yeah.  Save it for "Dateline: Tuesday."  Uh, what's 
	your address so I can come arrest you?
Marge:	Arrest me?  Um, my address, it's um, 1-2-3 ... Fake 
	Street.

% Ned reads a story to Todd.

Ned:	[reading] Harry Potter, and all his wizard friends, went

% Santa's Little Helper and Homer bound through the Flanders' living
% room.  "What the diddly-o?" Ned yells.  Homer finally grabs the dog,
% knocking the thumb into the path of Rod's electric train.  Just
% before the engine can run over the thumb, Homer stomps on the track,
% saving the thumb but ruining Rod's train.
%
% No time for remorse, though.  Homer and Marge rush in their car to
% seek medical help.  Marge is at the wheel.

Marge:	We've got to get to the hospital, Homer.
Homer:	Okay, if the doctor asks why you cut it off, you caught me 
	in bed with four beautiful women.
Marge:	Let's just say that Bart did it.
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Thinking up an alibi distracts Marge from the road, and she rear-
% ends another car.

Marge:	[frustrated] Eh, doodlebugs.
Ranier:	[gets out of his car] My Ferrari!  I had to do awful 
	things to pay for her.
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% The enraged actor pulls a golf club from his car and exacts revenge
% on the Simpsons' windshield.  While Wolfcastle focuses on that,
% Homer sneaks into the Ferrari, and motions for Marge to come join
% him.  She does, and they are soon on their way to Springfield
% General Hospital.
%
% At the hospital, they consult with Dr. Hibbert.

Hibbert:	I'm sorry, Homer.  Your HMO doesn't cover this type 
		of injury.
Homer:		But I have finger insurance.
Hibbert:	A thumb is not a finger!
Marge:		Isn't there anything you can do?
Hibbert:	Well, I could cut off the other thumb for a sense of 
		symmetry.
Homer:		Symmetry, eh?
		[cut to Homer and Marge driving in the Ferrari]
Marge:		Hibbert's really losing it.  We're going to Dr. 
		Nick's.
-- Now you're talking desperate, "Trilogy of Error"

% The thumb is starting to fade, so the Marge and Homer stop at Moe's
% for some more ice.  Homer goes into the bar while Marge waits in the
% car.

Homer:	Quick, Moe!  Marge cut off my thumb.
Moe:	No problem.  Just stick the ol' eye-gouger in the pickle 
	brine.  That'll keep your thumb fresh and delicious.
Homer:	[puts the thumb in the pickled-egg jar, and takes the jar 
	toward the front door] Thanks, Moe.
Moe:	Hey-ya, hey!  Ain't you gonna have a beer?  [sets a mug on 
	the bar]
Homer:	Well, I really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss 
	and all.  Although I do like the occasional beer.

% Moe smells the tell-tale scent of gangrene, and realizes he has to
% revive Homer.  Barney suggests a pot of coffee, which works.  Homer
% runs outside -- only to find Marge has gone!
%
% Homer tries hitchhiking, but his hitching thumb is the one in the
% jar.  Even so, Cletus the hick stops for him.

Homer:	Hey, thanks for stopping.
Cletus:	Tain't nothing.  You and me share a common infirmity.  If 
	anyone ever tells you a hog won't eat a finger, they's 
	lying.  [holds up his left hand, which has two fingers 
	missing]
-- Country wisdom, "Trilogy of Error"

% Cletus and Homer arrive at Dr. Nick's clinic, but Homer's streak of
% bad luck continues.  The clinic is on fire.  Dr. Nick talks to the
% fire chief, saying, "'Inflammable' means 'flammable'?  What a
% country!"  It makes you wonder what led up to that incident.
%
% Homer doesn't have time to consider that, though.  He asks Cletus if
% he can take him to Shelbyville Hospital, but a thief makes off with
% Cletus's truck.  Homer has to walk the twenty miles to Shelbyville.
%
% He makes it a mile or so out of town before realizing that it's
% futile.  Homer sadly concedes defeat, sets down the pickled-egg jar,
% and cradles his thumb in his hand.  "Well, friend, we always knew
% this day would come," he says.  "Say goodbye to your brother." 
% There's a "bang" in the distance.  Something is launched from the
% city, and lands near Homer.  It's Linguo's head!

Homer:	[gasps] Linguo -- dead?
Linguo:	Linguo *is* dead.  [fades out]

		[the class laughs]
Teacher:	En Francais.
		[class laughs with a stereotypical French accent]
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Lisa runs down the hall and literally bumps into another student, a
% boy about her age.

Lisa:		Sorry.  I was rushing because I'm at the wrong 
		school.  [giggles] Can you believe that?
Thelonious:	It's understandable.  All the schools in this area 
		were built from identical plans.  I guess they

Thelonious:	Yes.  The esoteric appeal is worth the beatings.
Lisa:		What do your friends call you?
Thelonious:	I don't really have any friends.
Lisa:		[gasps] Just like me!
-- Birds of a feather, "Trilogy of Error"

% Lisa and Thelonious hold hands and joyfully twirl around on West
% Springfield's front lawn.  Linguo joins in at some point. 
% Eventually, Lisa stops.

Lisa:		Oh, my God!  It's 11:15!  We've been spinning for 
		hours.  I've got to get to my school and hand in 
		Linguo.  Oh, but I don't want to leave you.
Thelonious:	You must.  You can't sacrifice grades for romance.

% Homer hasn't shown up yet, but Chief Wiggum is sitting at one of the
% booths, listening intently to a 2-way radio.  Lisa jogs up to him.

% Just then, Homer runs into the tavern.  It seems Marge has cut off

%
% More tough luck for Lisa -- the car runs out of gas.  Cletus's truck
% pulls up for a light, so Marge and Lisa hitch a ride by hopping in
% back with the chickens.
%
% Meanwhile, up in the cab, Homer entertains Cletus by doing that

% real.

Homer:	Abraca-thumb-bra!
Cletus:	[laughs] Dang, you could be one of them TV magic queers.

% Cletus stops at Dr. Nick's clinic, and he and Homer get out of the
