% The FBI guys interview the gravedigger.

Gravedigger: Yep, I saw her.  That is to say, I seen her.  She seemed
             like a nice lady.
      Burns: Well, that nice lady set the cause of biological warfare
             back thirty years!
   Smithers: We're only now finally caught up.
-- Boo hoo, "Mother Simpson"

Gravedigger: Two more ladies come by earlier that day.  One was real
             pretty, t'other, sort of plain.
              [the FBI guys, Burns, and Smithers go to the Bouvier
             sisters' house]
     Friday: Ma'am, we're going to need your assistance in locating this
             individual.
      Selma: [giggling] Oh, I'm fresh.  Don't you want to play "Good
             cop, bad cop"?
     Friday: Ma'am, we're all good cops.
      Selma: I had no intention of playing the good cops.
      Burns: Ew.  Look, we know you bought the tombstone, we know the
             fugitive visited that tombstone.  Whose tombstone was it?
      Patty: Just lift up your coffee cups and see.
              [they see Homer's tombstone]
   Smithers: Good Lord!
     Wiggum: Put out an APB on a Uosdwis R. Dewoh.  Uh, better start
             with Greektown.
     Friday: That's "Homer J. Simpson", Chief.  You're reading it upside
             down.
     Wiggum: Uh, cancel that APB.  But, uh, bring back some of them, uh,
             giros.
     Friday: Uh, Chief?  You're talking into your wallet.
-- Joe Friday's sharp eye, "Mother Simpson"

% The newly reassembled Simpson family eats dinner.

    Lisa: Grandma, have you ever thought about moving back to
          Springfield?
   Homer: You could live with Grampa again.
           [everyone, including Abe, laughs]
     Abe: Oh, I'm a living joke.
 Grandma: You know, Lisa, [phone rings] it might be nice to rest for a
          while.
           [Homer answers it, then leans into the doorway]
   Homer: Mom?  There's nothing to be alarmed about, but...could you
          take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?
           [outside, a tank and a police car pull up]
   Burns: [in the tank] I've been waiting 25 years for this moment.
           [puts on a tape of "Ride of the Valkyries"]
           [it turns into "Waterloo" by ABBA]
Smithers: I'm sorry, Sir, I must have taped over that.
-- A minor oversight, "Mother Simpson"

% The family look alarmed at the sound of the music.  The tank breaks
% open the front door.

  Friday: Freeze.  FBI: the jig is up.
     Abe: All right, I admit it: I am the Lindbergh baby.  Waah!  Waah!
          Goo goo.  I miss my fly-fly dada.
  Friday: Are you trying to stall us, or are you just senile?
     Abe: A little from column A, a little from column B.
Smithers: [panting] Sir!  She's gone.
           [Burns groans]
           [in a remote location in the Springfield badlands]
 Grandma: We made it, Homer!
   Homer: It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster.
           [into the phone] But who are you?  And why did you tip us
          off?
  Wiggum: [on phone] Well, it's 'cause of your old lady that I got rid
          of my asthma that was keeping me out of the academy.
   Homer: Thanks.
  Wiggum: Sure.  Just think of me as an anonymous friend who rose
          through the ranks of the Springfield police to become Chief
          Clancy Wig --
   Homer: [hanging up] Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!
-- Impatience is a virtue, "Mother Simpson"

% Homer bids his final goodbyes to his mother.

Grandma: Well, there's my ride.  The underground awaits.
  Homer: [sniffles] At least this time, I'm awake for your goodbye.
Grandma: [sniffles] Oh.  Remember, whatever happens, you have a mother,
         and she's truly proud of you.
          [they hug]
 Hippie: Oh!  Hurry up, man.  This electric van only has twenty minutes
         of juice left!
          [Grandma walks into the van]
  Homer: Don't forget me!
Grandma: Don't worry, Homer: you'll always be a part of me.
          [hits her head on doorframe] D'oh!
-- And how!, "Mother Simpson"

% She closes the door and drives off.  Homer watches the van leave, then
% sits on the hood of his car until nightfall, staring contemplatively
