Homer: Oh.

% Marge sends the kids to bed, though Lisa wants to hear the witty banter

% Ned mixes a drink...

Homer: Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it!
Ned:   Au contraire, Simpson.  It has three shots of rum, a jigger of
       bourbon, and just a little daberilla of creme de cassis for flavor.
Homer: Really?  Well, I do have a warm sense of well-being, and I sheem
       to be slurring my speech.  You're right!  Gimme another.
-- Flanders demonstrates his mixological skills, ``War of the Simpsons''

Marge: Mm.
-- Homer starts getting tipsy, ``War of the Simpsons''

Is that a new kind of mace?  It's really painful.

% so Homer sends him to bed.  Later that evening, Homer makes a fool of
% himself with a lampshade on his head.  Meanwhile, Maggie gets into
% the pile of coats and makes confetti of the dollar bills.  Homer drunkenly
% tells off a guest, and looks down Maude's dress.  The guests leave...

Dr. Hibert:  If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you

Marge: Thank you, I will, Dr. Hibert.  Thanks for coming.
Dr. Hibert:  Remember, I said `if'.

But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!
-- Marge, ``War of the Simpsons''

% Marge says she's going to church alone.

Homer: I'm sorry it happened, and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect

Lisa: Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man.  He trusts us.  Are you sure it's
      right to take advantage of him?

Customer: And uh no one's ever caught him?
Clerk: Well, one fella came close.  Went by the name of Homer.  Seven feet
       tall he was, with arms like tree trunks.  His eyes were like steel,
