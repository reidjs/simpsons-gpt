       missing the cook-off, it's going on right now, and I'm missing 
       it.
Marge: All right, I *was* trying to keep it from you, but I had a good
       reason.  Every time you go to that cook-off you get drunk as a
       poet on payday.
-- As drunk as James Dickey?  "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Back to the present.  Homer is shuffling around in the closet.

-- Somehow I'm not reassured, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

Homer: [trying to pull his boots on]  Okay, quit nagging me, I won't
       have any beer.  Sheesh, why don't you have a cigarette or 
       something?
Marge: Mm, I suppose I could.
-- You've come a long way, baby, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Our favorite family arrives at the cook-off, where Homer anxiously

Wiggum: Afternoon, Homer.  Care for some chili?  I've added an extra

 Homer: Uh, Wiggy?  My chili's getting cold.
-- A fistful of chilis, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Everyone holds his breath as Homer nonchalantly picks a pepper from

Homer: [slyly] Maybe I do, son.  Maybe I do.

-- Bad cops, bad cops, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% To everyone's surprise, Homer quickly downs the pepper, and asks for
