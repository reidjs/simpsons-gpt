 Bart: What's that extra B for?
Homer: It's a typo.
 Lisa: Dad!  Can't you have some other type of party, one where you

Homer: All normal people love meat.  If I went to a barbeque and there

 Troy: Oh!  Hello Bobby.
Jimmy: Jimmy.  I'm curious as to how meat gets from the ranch to my

 Troy: Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Slow down Jimmy.  You just asked a mouthful.

 Troy: Come on Jimmy, let's take a peek at the killing floor.
Jimmy: Ohhh!
 Troy: Don't let the name throw you Jimmy.  It's not really a floor,

       through so it can be collected and exported.
-- Troy nearly got in at Hendon, "Lisa the Vegetarian"

Scientician: [Looking up from a microscope.]  Uhhh...
       Troy: He'll tell you that, in nature, one creature invariably

              [Images of various wild carnivores attacking and eating
             others appear.]

      Jimmy: Wow, Mr. McClure.  I was a grade A moron to ever question

      really ripping lentil soup.
Lisa: When will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy
      simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains and cheese.
 Apu: Oh, cheese!
Lisa: You don't eat cheese, Apu?
 Apu: No I don't eat any food that comes from an animal.
Lisa: Ohh, then you must think I'm a monster!
 Apu: Yes indeed I do think that.  But, I learned long ago Lisa to
      tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them.  You know
      you can influence people without badgering them always.  It's like
      Paul's song, "Live and Let Live".
Paul: Actually, it was "Live and Let Die".
 Apu: Well, whatever, whatever. it had a good rhythm.
-- "Lisa the Vegetarian"

Lisa: I guess I have been pretty hard on a lot of people.  Especially my
      dad.  Thank you guys.
Paul: Lisa, before you go.  Would you like to hear a song?
Lisa: Wow, that would be great!
Paul: OK, take it Apu.
-- That's Apu de Beaumarchais to you, "Lisa the Vegetarian"

% Apu starts singly badly, while Paul and Linda clap along.  Lisa backs
% away quietly and leaves the store, where she sees Homer looking under
% manhole covers for her.

Homer: Lisa!  Lisa!  Come back before everyone finds out what a horrible
       father I am.
 Lisa: Hi dad.  Looking for me?
Homer: I don't know.  You looking for me?
 Lisa: I don't know.
Homer: Ohhhh.  Lisa.  I was looking for you.  I wanted to apologize.  I
       don't know exactly what went wrong but it's always my fault.
 Lisa: Actually Dad, this time, I was wrong...
Homer: Oooh!
 Lisa: ...too.
Homer: Ohh.
 Lisa: While I was gone I got some really good advice from Paul and
       Linda McCartney.
Homer: Rock stars.  Is there anything they don't know?
-- The eternal question, "Lisa the Vegetarian"

 Lisa: I still stand by my beliefs.  But I can't defend what I did.  I'm
       sorry I messed up your barbeque.
Homer: I understand honey.  I used to believe in things when I was a
       kid.  Come on, I'll give you a piggyback...I mean a veggieback
       ride home.
-- The new 90s vocab, "Lisa the Vegetarian"

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:11]
%
% "Maybe I'm Amazed" plays into the closing credits.  Ricardo Lafaurie
% transcribes the lyrics as follows, with ellipses indicating where Paul
% speaks backwards:
% 
% Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
% Maybe I'm amazed at the way I love you
% You pulled me out of time
% You hung me on the line
% Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you
% ...
% Maybe I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man
% Who's in the middle of something
% ...
% That he doesn't really understand
% ...
% Maybe I'm a man, and baby, you're the only woman
% Who could ever help me
% ...
% Baby, won't you help me to understand?
% Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
% 
% The instrumental continues while McCartney continues speaking
% backwards.
