% At the Springfield Post Office, Principal Skinner leads a party of 
% schoolchildren on a tour.

Skinner:	Hey, hey!  Settle down, children.  Now, who's ever 
		wondered how the post office works?
		[dead silence from the kids, who stare blankly]
Skinner:	No one?
Lisa:		I did, until we came here last year.
Skinner:	[fondly] Ah, yes, last year.  Anyway, look!  Here comes 
		our guide for the day, Postmaster Bill!
Bill:		[laughs] Howdy, partners!  Welcome to your post office.
Bart:		Wow!  It's ours?
		[Bart knocks some papers off a shelf and grabs a pen, with 
		which he uses to draw on the wall]
Skinner:	Bart!
Bart:		Be with you in a minute!
-- Don't tell him that it's "your country" either, "Sunday, Cruddy
   Sunday"

% Unflustered, Postmaster Bill continues his tour.

Bill:		This is the lobby, where customers come for all their 
		postalistic needs.
Krusty:	[looking at a poster advertising stamps] Legends of comedy 
		my tukhas.  What has Fatty Arbuckle done that I haven't 
		done?
-- I'd make a list, but there'd be a paper shortage, "Sunday, Cruddy
   Sunday"

% From the lobby, the kids go into a room dominated by a big, 
% complicated machine.

Bill:		This machine reads zip codes.  These five digits tell us 
		where to direct your mail.
Lisa:		But it's nine digits now, what's the point of these 
		other four numbers?
Bill:		Those are citizen relocation codes.  With any luck, 
		we'll ... never need 'em.
		[a red light on a wall-mounted security camera blips; 
		behind it are a pair of security guards, one of which 
		has his finger on a big red button.  They stare at a 
		picture of Lisa on their screen]
Guard #1:	She's onto us.  Should I flood the chamber?
Guard #2:	Not yet.  Let's get some lunch.
-- Sunday, Cruddy Sunday

% Back in the mail room, the field trip continues.

Skinner:	Well, children, any questions for Postmaster Bill?
Nelson:	You ever gone on a killing spree?
Bill:		[laughs] No, no!  The day of the gun-totin' disgruntled 
		shooting up the place went out with the Macarena!
Skinner:	Well, I'm just glad I work in an elementary school.
-- So are the postal workers, "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday"

% The group moves on to the employee lounge.

Bill:			And this is where our employees gather to unwind 
			after a hard day of servin' the public.
			[opens the door; behind it, three mail carriers 
			sit at a table, searching letters for cash]
Mail Carrier #1:	Bingo!  Birthday card!
Mail Carrier #2:	Graduation!
Mail Carrier #3:	Ding-ding-ding!  Wedding!
			[Bill shuts the door quickly and chuckles 
			uneasily]
-- And I thought they didn't want you to mail cash, "Sunday, Cruddy 
   Sunday"

% The last stop on the field trip is the Dead Letter Office.  "As a 
% souvenir of your visit," offers Bill, "you can each help yourself to 
% one piece of undeliverable mail."  The kids excitedly rush over to 
% the mail cart.

Ralph:	[picks up a package addressed to Otto, which is sniffed 
		and growled at by two nearby drug-sniffing dogs] I got 
		some dog food!
Milhouse:	I got my letter to Santa.
Bart:		A coupon book?  What am I gonna do with this piece of 
		junk?
		[sometime later at home, Bart tosses Homer a present]
Bart:		Happy birthday, Dad.
Homer:	Wow!  A Valu-Qual coupon book!  Let's see ... ten 
		percent off carpet cleaning.  Ten! [gasps] Two pizzas 
		for the price of one at Doughy's!
Lisa:		Doughy's has terrible pizza!
Homer:	Yeah, but there's two!
Marge:	Ooh, free foot pain analysis.
Homer:	Oh, Marge, that's a trick to get you in there so they 
		can cure your foot pain.
Marge:	Oh, I guess.  [limps off toward the kitchen]
Homer:	See ya, kids!  Me and my Valu-Qual coupon book are gonna 
		paint the town red, with savings!  I'll start with a 
		couple of pizzas, then a complimentary tango lesson, and 
		I'll cap it off with a smooth, refreshing colonic.
Lisa:		Um, Dad?
Homer:	[singing] Do you like pina colonics, and getting caught 
		in the rain ... [slams door behind him] passing out in 
		the ocean ...
-- Refreshing indeed, "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday"

% At "High-Pressure Tire Sales", Homer takes advantage of one of the 
% coupon book's offers.  His car is being inspected while on a lift.

Homer:	Now, this wheel balancing is free, right?
Worker:	Oh, you betcha, absolutely.  Deh, uh, oh, uh-oh, wait a 
		minute.  These tires won't take a balance!
Homer:	They won't?
Worker:	Nah, nah, no, you hear that clunk? [knocks on wheel]
Homer:	No ...
Worker:	Well, that tells me you need four new tires.
Homer:	Really?
Worker:	Yeah.  Legally, I can't even let you drive outta here on 
these.
Homer:	Oh, please, can't you let me slide this time?
Worker:	Gee, I'd really like to, but if my boss found out, I ...
		[the employee makes a quick hand gesture to his boss]
Boss:		All right, what's going on over here?  Were you gonna let 
		this man drive out of here on unsafe tires?
Worker:	No boss, I swear!
Boss:		Ah, that's it, you're fired!
Homer:	No!  Wait!  This is all my fault!  Oh, if I could only 
		turn back the clock and buy four new tires ...
		[the two workers smile]
-- Are you taking advantage of the coupons, or are the coupons taking
   advantage of you?  "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday"

% Later, Homer sits in the waiting room alone, next to a copy of Trout 
% Fever magazine, a portrait of the man who had just scammed him (the 
% "Customer Care Specialist"), and a broken TV.  Cheerful yet annoying 
% Muzak plays.  Suddenly, someone walks in.

Wally:	Ooh, I know that look, heh.  You came in for the free 
		wheel balance and now it's costing you five hundred 
		simoleans.
Homer:	Six, with the tip.
Wally:	Hey, you got off easy.  I just came in to use the phone, 
		and they got me for the whole road king package -- 
		alignment, shocks, Armor All, stem lube ...
Homer:	[laughs] Stem lube!  Even I didn't fall for that.  
		Although winter is coming.
Wally:	Man, we are a couple of grade "A" suckers. [laughs] Wally 
		Kogen.
Homer:	Hey, I know you!  We were in the same pyramid scheme.
Wally:	Oh, don't remind me.  "Friends helping friends" my ass.  
		Say, you wanna grab a beer while we're waiting?
Homer:	Yeah, I'm getting tired of them pointing and laughing at 
		us.

% At Moe's Tavern, the two drink a beer while the bar TV plays a 
% football documentary.

Announcer:	The road to the Super Bowl is long and pointless.  I 
		mean, when you think about it.
Homer:	[laughs] Football's so great.
-- He never thought about it, "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday"

% The documentary continues.

Announcer:	But now, the two conference champs must survive a 
		harrowing bye-week that no one enjoys.
		[the TV shows a bunch of football players lounging by a 
		pool]
Moe:		Bye-weeks.  Bronco Nagurski didn't get no bye-weeks!  
		And now he's dead!  Well, maybe they're a good thing.
Wally:	Yeah, how 'bout that Super Bowl?  You going this year?
Homer:	Me?  Nah.  Unless there's a coupon for it! [flips 
		through coupon book] Nah.
Wally:	Well, I run the Springfield Travel Agency.  We've got a 
		charter bus going down to the game.  You help us fill 
		it, you can ride for free!
Homer:	Homer Simpson at the Super Bowl?
		[imagines himself watching the game; a player is hauled 
		off on a stretcher]
Coach:	Dang!  That was my last quarterback.  Now what am I 
		gonna do?  [The coach looks into the crowd, and sees 
		Homer] You!
Homer:	Me?
Coach:	Yeah, you!  Get your hand off my wife's leg!
Homer:	Sorry!  [pulls his hand off the leg of the woman 
		sitting next to him, who glares]

% Back to the bar.

Homer:	It's a deal!  Hey, Moe, you wanna come with me and Wally 
		to the Super Bowl?
Moe:		Oh, absolutely!  My favorite team's in it!  The ... [he 
		brings a beer mug up to his mouth, obscuring the exact 
		motion of his lips] Atlanta Falcons.  Yeah, ever since I 
		was a boy, I've always loved the ... [again, with the mug]

% In his kitchen, Homer, wearing his glasses, holds a clipboard and

Lenny:	[on phone] Naah ...
Homer:	Come on ...
Lenny:	Naah ...
Homer:	Come on!
Lenny:	Naah ...
Homer:	Oh, come on!
Lenny:	Oohhh ...
Homer:	Yes!  Now that Lenny's in, Carl will fall like a domino.
Marge:	I'm so happy you're going to the big game.  My dream has 
		always been to see the Bolshoi ballet.
Homer:	Yeah, yeah.  Do we have any pencils that work?
Lisa:		[looking at Homer's clipboard] Wow, you've signed up quite

		Guy, the Squeaky-Voiced Teen ...
Homer:	Yeah, it's a good group.
-- Can you name a better group?  "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday"

% In front of Wally's travel agency, Homer's Bowl buddies wait at the 
% corner for the bus, which pulls up.  Wally agrees that Homer has 
% assembled a good group.  With no women in the group the guys decide 
% they can hang loose.  One by one, the guys let their bellies out, 
% which bulge out their shirts not unlike bullfrog necks.  Just then, 
% the door to the bus opens; an attractive woman sits behind the 
% wheel.  "All aboard for Miami," she says, to which the men on the 
% street corner pull themselves back together.
%
% In a short while, everyone is packed up and ready to go.  Wally, 
% standing at the front of the bus, raises his arms.

Wally:	Super Bowl, please, and step on it!
Bus:		Yay!
Rudy:		[running up to catch the moving bus] Hey, wait up!
Moe:		Ah, crap, it's that pip-squeak Rudy.
Homer:	[opening the bus door] What is it, Rudy?
Rudy:		[running alongside] Can I come, too?
Krusty:	Forget it, kid.  You're too small to go to the Super Bowl.
Rudy:		But what I lack in size, I make up for in ... [the door

Homer:	'Yello.
Clinton:	Uh, hello, this is President Clinton.
Homer:	Hey, how ya doing?
Clinton:	You know, your determination and grit under extreme 
		pressure are an inspiration.  The whole country is proud 
		of you.
Homer:	Well it's about time!
Clinton:	And on behalf of America, I'd like to ...
		[just then, Homer gets snapped in the butt by Reverend 
		Lovejoy's towel]
		Ow!  [chases after Lovejoy, giggling]
Clinton:	Hello?  Hello?  I command you to answer me!  Hello? [sees 
		Gore taking measurements on Clinton's window] Al, do you 
		have to do that right now? [Gore nods]

% After the game, the Springfielders get ready to get back on the bus.

Lenny:	What are you gonna do with your Super Bowl ring, Carl?
Carl:		Eh, I'll probably give it to my wife.  It's our 
		anniversary today.
All:		Awww!
Bart:		[sees Homer with the championship trophy] Dad, that 
		doesn't belong to you.
Homer:	But this might be my last chance to win one.
Wally:	Well, we sure put together a heck of a trip, Homer.  Ever 
		thought about being a travel agent?
Homer:	Wally, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't.
Wally:	'Cause you can really ... "go" places in the travel 
		business.  Huh? [laughs] Feel free to use that one.
Homer:	What one?
-- "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday"

% The bus pulls off; John Madden and Pat Summerall, who had been 
% standing behind it, come out to discuss their opinion of the 
% episode.  [And since they're not on the Internet, their opinion 
% counts -- Ed.]

Summerall:	Well John, what did you think of tonight's episode?
Madden:	I loved it!  The last-minute addition of Wally Kogen to 
		the line-up was a bit of a gamble, but it really paid 
		off.
Summerall:	Marge and Lisa painting eggs?  Did that work for you?
Madden:	Ho, ho, big time!  They came off the bench with a huge 
		effort that allowed Homer and Bart to make some 
		significant gains.
Summerall:	Did it strike you as odd that in a Super Bowl show with 
		Dolly Parton we didn't see any football or singing?
Madden:	I hadn't thought about it, Pat, but in retrospect, it 
		was kind of a rip-off!  What a way to treat the loyal 
		fans, who put up with so much nonsense from this 
		franchise.
Summerall:	Any final thoughts? 
Madden:		Nah, I'm too mad, let's get the heck out of here!
-- Now you don't even need to review the episode, "Sunday, Cruddy
   Sunday"

% A bus pulls up on the road behind John and Pat; Vincent Price is 
% driving.

Vincent:	All aboard, boys, I've been waiting for you!
Madden:	Now I'll tell you, that doesn't make a lick of sense!
Summerall:	I know.  Just get on the bus.
		[the two get on; we get a parting shot of the vehicle 
		from above and behind, as Price tries to work the manual 
		transmission]
Vincent:	Second pedal, clutch ... wait, wait, I'll get it!
Jody:		Give it some gas, Grandpa!
Vincent:	Oh, quiet, Jody, you're not helping.
