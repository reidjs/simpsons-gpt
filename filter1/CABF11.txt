% And now, a word from our sponsors.

		[a figure in a bathrobe turn stands at a sink, back
		toward the camera]
Announcer:	Look who's making breakfast!
		[the "housewife" turns around and giggle -- it's 
		Itchy and Scratchy, with the cat standing on the 
		mouse's shoulders]
Boy +
 Girl:		Itchy and Scratchy!
Scratchy:	That's right, kids.
Itchy:		Never start the day on an empty stomach.  [uses a 
		funnel to pour an entire box of Stabby-Os cereal 
		down Scratchy's throat]
Scratchy:	[lies down on the kitchen table] It's delicious.  
		Want to try?
Boy +
 Girl:		Yay!
		[Itchy slices Scratchy's chest open with a large 
		knife, swinging the two halves of his rib cage apart 
		as if they were barn doors.  A good breakfast 
		includes a generous serving of milk, so Itchy pours 
		some on top of the cereal]
Scratchy:	Oooh!  So cold ...
		[the kids dig in]
Boy:		Wow!  Pink daggers!  [a large marshmallow bit in the 
		shape of a dagger floats above the kids, like in the 
		"Lucky Charm" commercials.  The same thing happens 
		with the other things the kids name]
Girl:		Green hatchets!
Boy:		Yellow icepicks!
Scratchy:	[holding up some breakfast side dishes] And Stabby-
		Os are part of this nutritious breakfast ... [he 
		trails off as the blood and color drains from his 
		head, and drops the dishes]
Girl:		Hey, if you guys made breakfast, where's Mom?
Mom:		[from under a tureen] Here I am.  [Itchy lifts the 
		tureen, revealing Mom's immaculately coifed head on 
		a platter] But thanks to Stabby-Os, most of me is 
		still in bed.
		[cut to the Simpsons' living room.  Homer, Bart, and 
		Lisa lounge in front of the TV in their pajamas]
Lisa:		That ad campaign may have crossed a line.
Homer:		Eh, what can you do?  Sex sells.
		[the kids look at Homer dubiously]
-- So does a bit of the old ultraviolence, "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Marge walks in.  She seems surprised to find her family there.

Marge:	Ah!  Homer?  You're still here?  You should have left for 
	work an hour ago.
Homer:	They said if I come in late again, I'm fired.  I can't 
	take that chance.
-- "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Bart and Lisa are also running late.  They're still in the pajamas,
% and the school bus is only two blocks away.  Marge takes matters
% into her own hands.  She grabs both kids, hauls them up to the
% bathroom, and brushes both sets of teeth at once.  Then she takes
% them back down the stairs, before Bart has a chance to spit, even. 
% Her hands a blur, Marge dresses both kids on the way downstairs. 
% When they get to the bottom, Bart is wearing a classic red
% minidress, while Lisa looks rugged in her orange shirt and blue
% shorts.
%
% By the time they get to the kitchen, each Simpson child is wearing
% their usual attire.  Marge literally stuffs some food in their
% mouths for breakfast.  Bart chokes briefly on a grape, so Marge
% applies the Heimlich maneuver.  The grape flies across the kitchen
% and Homer jumps up and catches it in his mouth.
%
% Marge, Bart, and Lisa reach the curb in record time (Marge looking a
% little worse for the wear).  Alas, all their rushing around was for
% naught; the bus has just left.  Marge refuses to be defeated.  She
% takes both kids in the station wagon and drives after the bus.  When
% she tries to flag the bus down, Otto misinterprets Marge's waving as
% a challenge to race.  Challenge accepted -- Otto floors it, and the
% bus lurches ahead.  It breaks through a chain-link fence and into
% Springfield's aqueduct system.  Marge follows, and the two vehicles
% race through the dry canal system, running up and down the sloping
% canal walls.  She's deadly serious, but the kids on the bus are
% having a grand old time.

Whoa!  It's like "Speed 2" only with a bus instead of a boat!
-- Milhouse Van Houten, "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Otto's bus flies out of the canal, and back onto the road.  Marge is
% close behind, and soon overtakes Otto.  Her car screeches to a halt
% just in front of the school bus, forcing Otto to stop.  Marge is
% jubilant, despite the fact that she and Otto are now both parked
% right in front of the school.  Bart and Lisa get onto the bus, which
% rolls forward a few feet to the "official" school bus stop.
%
% Before the children have the chance to get off the bus, Otto
% remembers that he forgot to pick up a new student.  He closes the
% doors, hangs a U-turn in front of the school, and the kids' wild
% ride continues.
%
% The children wonder what the newcomer will be like.  Terri
% fantasizes about a handsome young boy on a horse.  Nelson imagines a
% child-octopus hybrid terrorizing the other students.  Ralph,
% thinking of the wrong kind of kid, imagines a goat.
%
% They're all wrong.  The new girl is nothing like they imagined. 
% She's a red-head, not fat but sturdily built, like a house or a
% junior linebacker.  She's wearing a slightly dumpy blue dress over a
% white shirt.  The children on the bus talk amongst themselves as she
% finds her seat.

Sherri:		  Red hair?
Terri:		  What's she trying to pull?
Janey:		  Those shoes look Canadian.
Boy with braces:  She'll never fit in.
Lisa:		  Aw, it's tough being the new kid.  Someone should go 
		  talk to her.
Bart:		  Yeah, somebody should.  [looks out the window] One 
		  hour dry cleaner?  Man, that's fast.
-- "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Homer and Marge enjoy, sort of, some coffee and a quiet morning
% together.  The doorbell rings, and they both hurry to answer it.

Baby-proofer:	Your baby is dead!  [horrified, Homer and Marge 
		scream]  That's what you'd hear if your baby fell 
		victim to the thousands of deathtraps lurking in the 
		average American home.  [hands Marge a business 
		card]
Marge:		Springfield Baby-proofing?
Homer:		[panting] You, you really scared us.
Baby-proofer:	Sorry about that.  But the truth is ... your baby, 
		Maggie Simpson, is dead!  [Homer and Marge scream 
		once more] Dead tired of baby-proofers who don't 
		provide a free estimate.  Let's start in the 
		kitchen.  [walks in]
		[cut to the kitchen.  For her demo, the baby-proofer 
		ties on an oversized baby bonnet] Now, pretend I'm a 
		baby.  [baby voice] Me want to explore.  [gets down 
		on all fours and crawls around like an infant]
Homer:		[to Marge] That's a pretty big caboose for a baby.
Marge:		Homer, don't be ... wow, that is huge.
Baby-proofer:	[finds a plastic bottle under the kitchen sink] 
		Pwetty colors.  Me want to dwink.
		[tries to open the bottle, but the lid remains 
		stubbornly closed.  She bangs it on the floor, but 
		the bottle stays closed.  Then she takes the bottle 
		to the sink, stands up, and runs the lid under the 
		water for a few seconds to loosen it up.  She whacks 
		the lid against the lip of the sink until it finally 
		comes loose]
Marge:		[gasps] She got it open!
Baby-proofer:	You see how quickly your baby could have been 
		drinking this [reads label] Similac Baby Formula?
Homer:		[anguished] No!  [takes the bottle and stomps on it] 
		This is such an eye-opener.  I always pictured the 
		kids dying in the living room.
-- "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Later, the baby-proofer tallies up the cost of the safety equipment
% the Simpsons would need to protect Maggie from household hazards. 
% Homer considers the estimate momentarily, and then throws the baby-
% proofer out of the house.  "We don't need your high-priced safety
% junk!" he thunders.  Just then, Maggie falls out of one of the
% second-floor windows.  They baby-proofer deftly catches her, and
% hands her to Homer.  He politely thanks the baby-proofer.
%
% At the school, the new girl sits alone on the teeter-totter.  Some
% students watch her from the jungle gym.

Bart:		Look at the new kids hogging the teeter-totter -- 
		like she owns the place!
Milhouse:	Yeah, she thinks she's Babe: Pig in the City.
Lisa:		Give her a break.  Remember your first day at 
		school?
Milhouse:	Not as long as I keep taking these.  [holds up a 
		bottle of pills labeled, "Repressitol"]
Lisa:		Well, someone's got to make her feel welcome.
		[climbs down from the gym and walks over to the new 
		girl]
		Hi.  My name's Lisa.  What's yours?
		[the new kid punches Lisa, knocking her out]
-- No gratitude for the welcome wagon, "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  6:08]
%
% At home, Lisa nurses a real shiner.  Homer tries consoling her by
% confessing his own "bully problem."  Only problem is, it was Homer
% who was the bully, whaling on people to the tune of "Kung Fu
% Fighting."

Marge:	Why don't you try reaching out to this new girl?  See if 
	you two have a common interest.
Lisa:	Hmmm.  Well, lots of people like jazz fusion.  [picks up a 
	sax and plays a riff]
Marge:	Okay, that's in the "maybe" file.  What if you two bond 
	over your Malibu Stacey dolls.  [holds one up]
Lisa:	[takes it from Marge] They're not dolls, they're 
	aspiration figures.  But it might work.
-- "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Homer starts baby-proofing the house.

Homer:	That baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us safety covers 
	for the electrical outlets.  But I'll just draw bunny 
	faces on them to scare Maggie away.  [does so]
Marge:	She's not afraid of bunnies.
Homer:	She will be.
-- Be afraid, be very afraid, "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% At school, Lisa approaches the new girl.

Lisa:		Uh, Francine?  I think we got off to a bad start.  
		[notices Francine is holding a doll] Hey!  You like 
		Malibu Stacey, too!
Francine:	Oh, yeah.
Lisa:		And you like the same one I like, with the grad 
		student glamour pack.  Just like the one in my-- 
		[sees that her locker door has been forced open] 
		locker.  That's mine, isn't it?
Francine:	[bites the head off the doll, and spits it at Lisa] 
		Tastes like yours.
		[picks up Lisa, throws her in her locker, closes the 
		door, and walks away]
Lisa:		[from inside locker] How about jazz?  Do you like 
		jazz?
Milhouse:	[from locker next to Lisa's] I like jazz.
Lisa:		Milhouse?  She got you, too?
Milhouse:	Yeah, but it's not so bad.  I'm standing on Ralph.
Ralph:		[from the bottom of the locker] We're a totem pole.  
		[mock-Indian chant] Hi-ya, hi-ya!  Hoy-ya, hoy-ya!
-- "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Homer uses a nail gun to attach cushions to all the furniture.  He
% tells Maggie that he's protecting her from all the "sharp scary
% things," and then unwisely hands the nail gun to her.  Almost
% immediately, Maggie shoots nails at her dad, laughing.  He tries to
% get the gun back, but Maggie is having too much fun with her new
% toy, and nails Homer to the wall.  Fortunately, Marge comes in and
% takes the gun from Maggie, then pries her husband loose with a claw
% hammer.

Homer:		Now do you realize how unsafe the American home is?  
		Baby accidents occur every three minutes.
Marge:		I'm the one who told you that.
Homer:		Yeah, but this is me talking.  Look, I already 
		encased the telephone in concrete.  [points to the 
		phone, which is encased in a two-foot thick concrete 
		cube]
Marge:		How are you supposed to dial?
Homer:		Reach into these holes.  I use a carrot.  [holds one 
		up]
Marge:		Isn't that a little excessive?  I mean, how are the 
		buttons dangerous?
Homer:		Baby could order poison.
Marge:		Oh, that's ridiculous.  [Homer dials a number, then 
		gives the receiver to Marge]
PDS Man:	Poison Delivery Service.  A gift basket of poison is 
		on its way.
Marge:		Oh, I'm horrible mother.
Homer:		Of course you are.  Marge, I've finally discovered 
		the reason God made me.  To protect his tiniest, 
		most breakable creatures.  And I've got to share 
		that gift with the world.
		[another volley of nails strikes Homer]
		[to Marge] Get her out of here?
-- But who protects the protector?  "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% The schools established bully clique -- Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and
% Kearney -- have suspended Martin under the bleachers.  They throw
% tomatoes at him, tauntingly asking, "Why are you throwing tomatoes
% at yourself?"  Lisa comes by.

Lisa:		Knock-knock.
Nelson:		What do you want.  [crushes the tomato he's holding]
Lisa:		Would you bullies be interested in some bodyguard 
		work?
Nelson:		This is so funny.  We were just talking about moving 
		into protection.
Dolph:		We're offering a recess and lunch package that's 
		very affordable.
Lisa:		Well, I'm going to need full coverage.  My bully is 
		highly aggressive.  Check out these Indian burns.  
		[holds out her arm, which has some red stripes on 
		it.  The bullies are impressed]
Jimbo:		Triple twist!  Nice work!
Kearney:	You sure this was done by hand?
Lisa:		Yeah, she's a real purist.
Nelson:		She?  [the bullies back away] Sorry, we don't do 
		girls.  They bite and kick and scratch.
Dolph:		And sometimes we fall in love.  [the bullies sigh]
-- "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Lisa admits that there's much she doesn't know about bullying. 
% Nelson walks off with her to explain the nuances of the art,
% ordering the rest of the guys to finish up with Martin.

Lisa:	I just don't understand Francine's motivation.
	[cut to a shot of Francine tripping Milhouse and Data, but 
	leaving Bart untouched]
	Why does she only go after the smart ones?
Nelson:	That's like asking the square root of a million.  No one 
	will ever know.
Lisa:	Someone will -- I'm going to crack the bully code.
-- "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Homer has named his baby-proofing business "Wee Care" and sings a
% little tune to himself as he drives to his clients.  For the
% Nahasapeemapetilans, he places some foam "We're #1" hands on a
% statue of Shiva.  The couple appreciates the new safety padding, if
% not Homer's suggestion that they switch to "a nice, round Buddha."
%
%  Moving on, Homer makes the Hibberts' pool safer by replacing the
% water with blue gelatin.  Hibbert is upset at first, but not when
% Homer scoops him a nice parfait glass of gelatin.  Later, he makes
% the street safe for Ralph to run in by installing a set pop-up
% blades in the street.  When a car approaches, the blades blow out
% the tires, stopping the car (but not the driver, who flies through
% the windshield) in its tracks.  He's injured, but hey, Homer's job
% is to protect children, not adults.  Lastly, Homer bubble-wraps an
% entire park playground (including the children).  The children play
% safely on the padded equipment, and Homer doesn't get nailed to
% anything.
%
% Lisa interrupts Willie while he's mopping up the floor, and asks to 
% see some of his security tapes.  At first, Willie tries to deny the
% existence of the tapes, but he comes clean when Lisa points out the
% fully exposed cameras mounted on the ceiling.
%
% Willie leads Lisa to the video room, which is almost as well-stocked
% with surveillance equipment as SNPP's.

Lisa:	Why does the school need to watch us all the time?
Willie:	School?
-- Rowdy Roddy Peeper is at it again, "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Lisa takes one of the tapes to a video player.  One of the
% monitoring screens shows that the boys' bathroom needs more paper
% towels.  Willie grabs a roll and leaves Lisa to her task.
%
% Lisa reviews that tapes of Wednesday's lunch period.  On the tape,
% she hides under a cafeteria table, but Francine finds her and
% administers a beating.  On another tape of gym class, Lisa and some
% other girls wait near the pool.  Francine walks by, ignoring Lisa. 
% Why the difference in Francine's reaction?  Looking closer, Lisa
% sees that by the pool, the children are all wearing nose clips.
%
% The door behind Lisa opens.  It's Francine.  Lisa, keeping her eyes
% on the monitor, assumes that it's Willie and announces that she's
% found out what sets off her tormentor.  Whatever it is must be
% working right now -- Francine attacks.  The camera pans to one of
% the video monitors, which shows Willie giving a thumbs-up after
% replacing the towels.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:34]
%
% Three of the school's nerds are in the gym, exercising on stair-step
% machines.  Lisa watches them closely.

Lisa:	Come on, people!  Move it!  I want to see some sweat!
Martin:	I'm not mastering another stair until you explain the 
	purpose of this monstrous experiment.
Lisa:	I believe the key to bully-nerd antagonism lies in your 
	drippings.
Martin:	Then I shall drip like a pot roast!
Lisa:	Excellent.  [takes a squeegee and a beaker] Now, don't 
	mind the squeegee.  [squeegees some sweat of their backs, 
	into the beaker]
Data:	Ah the scraping seems so wrong, but it feels so right.
-- "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Professional boxer Drederick Tatum urges the students in Mrs. K's
% classroom to stay in school.  Skinner thinks it's a "knockout
% oration" in spite of Tatum's lack of enthusiasm.  Lisa walks into
% the classroom.

Lisa:		Mr. Tatum, do you mind if I swab you with this damp 
		rag?
Tatum:		No, not at all.  Swab away.  [Lisa pours some blue 
		liquid from a beaker onto the rag]
		Whoa, whoa -- nobody mentioned a beaker.
Lisa:		Please?  It's for science.
Tatum:		Oh, for science.  In that case, proceed.
Skinner:	Lisa, this is outrageous.  Explain yourself!
Lisa:		Shh!  It's working -- look!
		[Nelson is compelled to get out of his chair and 
		walks, fists extended, toward the champ]
Krabappel:	Nelson, what are you doing?
Nelson:		I don't know.  I can't help myself.  [punches Tatum]
Tatum:		Young man, I insist that you desist.
Nelson:		Sorry.  [continues punching] I'm so sorry.  [near 
		tears, he runs behind Tatum and gives him a wedgie] 
		Please don't hurt me.
Tatum:		[rolling up his sleeve] You leave me little 
		recourse.
-- Science is a harsh mistress, "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Homer and Marge watch "Afternoon Yak" for about three seconds, and
% then turn to the local news.

Kent:		The safe-baby craze:  It's sweeping Springfield 
		thanks to one crusading parent.
Homer:		That's me!  [gets off the couch, dancing and 
		singing] Safety dance, safety dance, everybody look 
		at your pants!
Kent:		But while Homer Simpson has made our babies safe, 
		he's made infant-related businesses cry -- all the 
		way *away* from the bank.
		[cut to Kent interviewing a businessman]
		How are your baby crutch sales?
Businessman:	Uh, terrible, Kent.  And cartoon character Band-
		Aids, forget about it.
		[cut to Hibbert, holding up a happy baby]
Hibbert:	Look at this baby.  Not a scratch on him, and I've 
		got boat payments.
		[cut to a factory owner, standing in front of the

Owner:		The dream is over.  Shut 'er down, boys!
		[a steam whistle blows, and the factory stops.

-- Homer's safety crusade comes to and end, "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% The Simpsons attend a convention of scientists.  Lisa is to present

Frink:		Scientists -- scientists, please.  Looking for some 
		order.  Some order, please, with the eyes forward 
		and the hands neatly folded and the paying attention 
		... [shouts] Pi is exactly 3!  [the audience gasps 
		and falls silent] Very sorry it had to come to that, 
		but now that I have your attention, we have some 
		exciting new research from young Lisa Simpson.  
		Let's bring her out and pay attention.
		[the audience applauds as Lisa walks onstage.  The 
		crowd sees that she's a little girl, and doubts that 
		she has anything useful to say]
Lisa:		[clears throat] My study is called, "Airborne 
		Pheromones and Aggression in Bullies."
		[the crowd gasps.  Someone says, "I'm afraid"]
		For as long as there has been smart people, there 
		have been bullies to prey on them.  From Galileo 
		[shows a slide of the astronomer getting beaten up] 
		to Sir Isaac Newton, [another slide] and even in the 
		animal kingdom.  [shows a slide of a large dog 
		victimizing a smaller one]
		But why do the brawny prey on the brainy.  Is it 
		jealousy?
		[the crowd seems to think so]
		No!  The reason is chemical.  [the crowd murmurs]
Scientist 1:	Wait, that's impossible.  Chemicals are our friends.
Dr. Koop:	She's a witch!

% Lisa asks for a chance to demonstrate.  She reveals her test

		repellant.
		[the crowd murmurs, astonished]
Lisa:		Actually, it's just ordinary salad dressing.  [crowd

Marge:		So that's where that went.
Lisa:		The pungent vinegar and tangy Roquefort block the
