Chairman:	People, people, please!  You're forgetting what the 
		Olympics are all about: giving out medals of 
		beautiful gold, so-so silver and shameful bronze.  
		[crowd murmurs]  I have here a letter from a little 
		girl named Lisa Simpson.  She says her town might 
		not be important enough to host the Olympics, but 
		she asks if the torch could just past by so that she 
		could experience the glow that we feel every day.  
		Well, I say we don't bring her the torch I say we 
		bring her the Olympic Games.  Who is with me?  
		[silence] Well, I don't care -- it's my decision.

% Naturally, this is big news back home.

Brockman:	Springfield was shocked today to learn it will host 
		the next Olympics.  Economists predict our city will 
		experience the same boom Sarajevo enjoyed after the 
		1984 Games.
Marge:		And it's all because of your letter, Lisa.
Lisa:		Well, actually, I just wrote it for a school 
		assignment.  Everyone else wrote to the Backstreet 
		Boys.
Brockman:	To honor the arrival of our foreign friends and 
		enemies, Channel 6 is sponsoring a contest to find a 
		Springfield Olympic Mascot.  The winner will join 
		such other memorable mascots such as The Atlanta 
		"Whatzit" and the Montreal "Vampire".
Homer:		A mascot contest!  I'm sure to win that -- unless 
		one of you jinxes me.
Marge:		No one's gonna jinx you Homer.  In fact, we're 
		rooting for you.
Bart:		Yeah, go for the gold dad!
Homer:		Shut up, Shut up, Shut up!  [flees from the room]

Homer:	Knowing you always hate my first idea, I prepared a

		made the move to Intercourse, Pennsylvania.  Uh, why

		[Bart is about to say something when Skinner Quickly 
		puts his hand over his mouth]

% the tavern.  Homer offers Moe a can of party nuts, which Moe
% accepts.  Surprise!  It has another one of those springs in it --
