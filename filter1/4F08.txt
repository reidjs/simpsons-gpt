% At the Municipal House of Pancakes, a meeting is held for the
% Springfield Investorettes, composed of Maude Flanders, Luanne Van
% Houten, Agnes Skinner, Helen Lovejoy, Edna Krabappel and Marge.

They say the pancakes here stink.
-- Agnes Skinner at the Municipal House of Pancakes,
      "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Helen has a chart set up while explaining how their shares in Dynaflux
% Unimatics are up a "delicious seven and three quarters," meaning their
% investment club portfolio has nearly doubled in value.  Helen's
% suggestion: use their profits to invest into high-risk ventures.

 Edna: Oh!  Oh!  How about Oklasoft?  It's Oklahoma's fastest-growing
       software company.
Maude: Um, cushions?  Everybody likes to sit on cushions.
Agnes: Children are _so_ fat today.  [pounds her fist on the table]
       Isn't there some way we could make money off that?
-- "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Helen points out that a franchise fair is held that weekend, and
% proposes to buy a business.  Everybody murmurs in agreement, but Marge
% is reticent to the idea.

I'm not wild about these high-risk ventures.  They sound a little risky.
-- Marge's views on business, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Everybody glares at her, complaining about how she always objects to
% risky investments, yet getting her share of the profits.

Helen: All in favor of expelling Marge from the Investorettes?
  All: [raising hands]  Aye!
Marge: [gets up]  All right, Helen.  If I'm not wanted I'll leave.
Helen: You'll get your pancakes in the mail.
-- Better not invest in mayo then, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% At the dinner table, Marge glumly explains what took place that
% morning at the pancake house.

Marge: [sighs] ...and then they gave me back my $500 investment and
       kicked me out of the club.
Homer: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Back up a bit now.  When are the
       pancakes coming in the mail?
Marge: Well, maybe it's all for the best.
Homer: What do you need to make money for, anyway?  As long as I have my
       earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about.
       [stabs his eye with a hot dog]
       Oww!  Ohh!  Call work and tell 'em I won't be in tomorrow.
-- "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Listening to Lisa's advice to "roll the dice", Marge decides to beat
% those girls at their own game, and buy her own franchise.

% The next weekend at the Franchise Expo, visitors are greeted by a
% wiggling robot, holding money bags in its arms and standing in front
% of the entrance.

Robot: Greetings, humans.  I am Investo the robot, from the planet
       Opportuniac.  My superior brain advises you to enter the
       Franchise Fair.
Marge: Well, we're trying to but you're blocking our way.
Robot: Danger!  Danger!  Don't forget to pick up pamphlets.
 Bart: I'll handle this.  [pours his cola into the robot's vents]
        [the robot writhes and collapses on the floor]

Robot: [in a distorted voice]  Help.  Help.  Help.  Security code 30.
-- That'll teach all of ya robots, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% The family walks to what seems to be the hosting show of the expo.

Royce: That's the miracle of the franchise.  You get all the equipment
       and know-how you need, plus a familiar brand-name people trust.
       You'll be on a rocket-ride to the moon!  And while you're there,
       would you pick up some of that nice, green moon money for me --

% Marge goes to the "Picture Perfect" seminar.

 Host: Now, folks, I don't wanna alarm ya, but scientists say forty
       percent of America's pictures... are hanging crooked.
        [the audience gasp in shock]
       Yep, it's true.  And I hear you asking: "Well, who's gonna
       straighten out all these artistic abominations?"  Your friends?
       A neighbor?   Those fat cats at Washington?  [chuckles]  Good
       luck.  Hey, you know, maybe no one'll notice!  Maybe the problem
       with ju-u-u-st fix itself.
Marge: Now _you're_ the one who's being naive.
  Man: Okay.  Fair enough.  But _you_ sound like you're ready to become
       your own boss in the _exciting_ world of frame-nudging!  Yes, for
       a minimal franchise fee, you'll receive a pair of straightening
       gloves, a cannister of wall lubricant and a booklet of the most
       commonly asked questions you will hear, including: "Who are you?"
       and "What are you doing here?"
-- Wow... frame-nudging!, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Marge realizes she doesn't have any desire to own a business, and
% wonders what she's doing there in the first place.  As she turns
% around, she comes face to face with her former business partners.

Marge: Hello, Helen.
Helen: Marge.
Marge: Edna.
 Edna: Marge.
Marge: Uh...  [Agnes glares]  Hmm...
Agnes: [irritated]  Oh, my name is Agnes and you know it's Agnes!  It
       means lamb -- lamb of God.
Marge: I'm sorry, Agnes.
Agnes: Marge.

% Meanwhile, at Disco Stu's "Can't Stop the Learnin' Disco Academies"...

Disco Stu: [making indescribable body motions]  Did you know that disco

-- See you in the last decade, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% The Investorettes visit the Fleet-A-Pita franchise.

  Helen: Hmm, Pita.  Well, I don't know about food from the Middle East.
         Isn't that whole area a little iffy?
Hostess: [laughs]  Hey, I'm no geographer.  You and I -- why don't we

  Maude: [reading the ingredients list]  Umm, what's tahini?
Hostess: Flavor sauce.
   Edna: And falafel?
Hostess: Crunch patties.
  Helen: So, we'd be selling foreign...
Hostess: *Specialty* foods.  Here, try a Ben Franklin.
  Helen: [takes a bite]  Mmm, that *is* good. What's in it?
   Chef: [poking his head out of a window, looking of Indian origin]
         Tabbouleh and rezmi-kabob.
Hostess: [trying to cover-up]  Uh, th-that's our chef... Christopher.
   Chef: [mutters, and closes the window, cursing in Hindi]
-- You guys aren't from around here, are you?,
      "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% The girls gather around and start eating pitas, looking ready to buy
% the franchise.  Nearby, Marge glooms.

Look at them!  They've jumped on the one franchise I might possibly have
considered thinking about becoming interested in.
-- Oh, that's a downer, Marge, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Marge concludes she simply isn't cut out for the world of business.
% Next to her, the owner of the Pretzel Wagon booth observes that she
% sounds like "the old me, which was ironically, the young me."  Marge
% walks in, somehow sympathizing with him.
%
% The man tells that he was once like Marge and the others, "lost in a
% sea of flashy gimmicks and empty promises", until "God tossed me a
% life preserver.  A tasty, golden brown life preserver."  He flashes a
% pretzel, and offers it to Marge.

Marge: Hmm! It's not bad!
Frank: It's not only not bad -- it's not bread.  "Knot bread", you get
       it?  [chuckles]  See?
Marge: [laughing]  I do!
        [they both laugh]
Marge: Knot bread!
-- The usual pretzel-people jokes, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% After this last straw, Marge inquires about the cost of a pretzel

% right away.

Frank: Congratulations, and welcome to the dynamic world of mobile

Marge: When can I start?  Where's my territory?
Frank: Your... territory.  Well, lemme tell ya.  Wherever a young mother
       is ignorant of what to feed her baby, you'll be there.  Wherever
       nacho penetration is less than total, you'll be there.  Wherever

Marge: Don't forget fat people.  They can't stop eating!
Homer: [passing by the stand]  Hey, pretzels!

% Back in her kitchen, Marge pops a "Pretzel Wagon" videocassette guide
% in a VCR.  What we see is a bland office, while Frank sets up his

franchise up and running.
-- America's funniest pretzel videos,
      "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% The family gets in on Marge's business as they follow Frank's
% instructions.
%
% "Start by setting up an office in your basement or garage" is the
% first direction; Marge sets up the (again) cliche "Hang in there,
% baby!" poster with a cat hanging from a clothes-line.
%
% "An automatic garage door opener makes you feel like you're working in
% a futuristic wonderworld."  Homer puts the door to use by stutting it
% down in front of Ned.
%
% "Next, blanket your community with flyers.  A phony ticker-tape parade
% will help you avoid littering laws."  Bart and Marge take care of the
% pamphlets, while Homer rides in the streets with Lisa in the back
% seat, wearing some crazy Martian helmet.  The whole town cheers.

Welcome back, space girl!  [wipes a tear]
-- Chief Wiggum's emotional cry, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% The video continues...

Frank: Now you're ready to make pretzels.  Open your bag of

-- Less millipedes and your intestinal lining might've remained okay,

% Hours later, the kitchen is a total mess, and on the center table lies
% a batch of pretzels.  Bart and Lisa anxiously watch Homer, who's
% wearing his safety hat and badge from work with "Official Pretzel
% Inspector" written on it, checking a pretzel with a micrometer.  The
% inspector gives his approval, and the kids exchange high-fours.
%
% The first target of the new Pretzel Wagon is the power plant; when
% Marge honks outside, Homer paves the way for pretzel madness.

Homer: Hey, what's all that commotion outside?  Why, it's one of those
       pretzel wagons the movie stars are always talking about.
Lenny: [gasps]  Here?  Our plant?
Homer: That's right, Lenny.  Let's all give in to deliciousness -- the
       Pretzel Wagon way!
        [everybody cheers]
Homer: [among the commotion]  Yeah!  Homer's right!
-- The perfect setup, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% The whole plant rushes out to get pretzels, and Lisa rejoices at the
% sight of so many potent customers.  Once Marge has reminded everyone
% to put on their hairnets, they're all set for their first transaction.

Marge: Welcome to Pretzel Wagon.  May I take your order?
Lenny: [hesitating] Uh, let's see.  I'll have... one, uh...
 Carl: Hey, hurry up.  I wanna get my pretzel.
Lenny: One pretzel.
Marge: Thank you.
 Carl: [now in front of the line]  Uh, let's see, um...  I will have one
       of your, uh...
Burns: Come on, come on, while we're young.
-- We are?!, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Carl's hesitation is put to a halt by a nearby honking, that of the
% Fleet-A-Pita van which pulls up in the plant's parking lot.

Lenny: Wow, check out that van!  It looks like it doesn't even _need_
       out business.
 Carl: Hey, let's go!
-- Looks like your average customer to me,
      "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Soon enough, the pretzel line becomes the pita line, much to Marge's
% dismay.  She goes to have a talk to her competitors.

Marge: *Excuse* me.  I had this spot first.
 Edna: Sorry dear, just business.  Ha!
Marge: Well, I guess Macy's and Gimbels learned to live side by side.
Agnes: Gimbels is gone, Marge, long gone.  You're Gimbels.
-- "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Figuring the power plant isn't the only good location in town, Marge
% decides to literally take her business elsewhere.
%
% Along one of their runs, the Pretzel Wagon drives by Cletus' house.

Cletus: [waving]  Hey slow down!  I wants to talk to you!
         [Homer stops the car]
Cletus: Give us three hundred pretzels.
 Marge: [to Homer] You see?  A little persistence and patience paid off!
        [to Cletus] That'll be three hundred dollars.
Cletus: Hey I don't think so.  I got me three hundred coupons.
         [Cletus hands an armful of coupons to Marge]
 Marge: [growls] I should've said "Limit: one per customer."
Cletus: Should'a but didn't so hand 'em over.  Hey!  Kids!  We're eatin'

-- Learning business the hard way, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Cletus then yells for his kids as they walk one by one out of his

%
% Back in her garage-office, Marge needs a serious confidence boost.

Marge: [reading the poster] "Hang in there, baby!"  You said it, kitty.
       [looking more closely] "Copryright 1968."  Hmm, determined or
       not, that cat must be long dead.  That's kind of a downer.
-- That's one depressing way of looking at a citations dictionary,

% Lisa walks in, and tells Marge to think big, and set up her business
% at a major public event.  Marge's choice lays on the Springfield War
% Memorial baseball Stadium, where she holds Free Pretzel Day.

-- Remembered throughout history, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% In the kitchen, Bart and Homer try to cheer up a much depressed Marge.

-- Ah, that's close enough, Homer, "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"

% Homer floors it and drives to Frank Ormand's dreamy, candyland-style
