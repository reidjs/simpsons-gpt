% Marge tries to wake Homer up one weekend.  It's a task that's easier
% said than done.  When the traditional methods fail, she uses the
% power-adjustable mattress to set Homer upright.  Still, he doesn't
% wake up, until mattress closes around him like a clamshell.  A red
% liquid runs out onto the floor.  Horrified, Marge opens the mattress
% and is relieved to find out that it is a juice box, not her husband,
% who has been crushed.

Marge:	Sorry, Homey, but you promised to take me to the apron 
	expo today.
Homer:	Just give me ten more hours.  [rolls over to go back to 
	sleep]
Marge:	Come on, you and the kids always want to do fun stuff.  
	But today we're doing something I like.
	[Homer groans sleepily]
	They're unveiling a combination apron-smock.  [unfolds a 
	brochure from the expo and shows it to Homer] It's called 
	a "smapron."
Homer:	Did you say, "smockron?"
Marge:	No, "smapron."
Homer:	Oh.  [goes back to sleep]
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Marge literally drags Homer out of bed, and the family goes to the
% apron expo, which is so exciting that the writers decided not to
% bother showing any of it.  On the drive home, the Simpsons talk
% about the stuff they picked up at the apron show.  Lisa has a
% "Barbecue is Murder" apron she'll wear on the Fourth of July.  Bart
% has a lead apron to protect "downstairs."  Homer has a "Grrrl Power"
% apron, which he misread as "Grill Power."  Only Marge was
% disappointed -- too many aprons at the expo.
%
% Homer's looking forward to relaxing in bed with another juice box,
% but abruptly changes his mind when he passes a prison rodeo.  The
% family (well, Homer really) decides to stop and watch.

Welcome to Waterville State Penitentiary!  The contestants you'll see 
today are actual prisoners on a break from their telemarketing duties.
-- Warden, "Pokey Mom"

% The first man rides a bucking bronco, but is quickly thrown to the
% ground with a crunch.

Warden:	Well, don't feel too bad for him, folks.  He's in here for 
	erecting a nativity scene on city property.
	[audience boos loudly]
Marge:	There's so much evil in the world.
-- At least he wasn't praying in a school, "Pokey Mom"

% The second rodeo contestant successfully hog-ties a calf.  He pulls
% a knife to the calf's throat, and the warden reminds him that there
% will be no slaughtering today.  The convict tries convincing the
% warden that he and the calf were "just having a conversation."
%
% The warden introduces Jack Crowley, who is supposedly such a low-
% life that Bob Dylan wrote a song to keep him behind bars.  The bull
% quickly throws him into the wall.

Warden:		Oh, he's down!  And it looks like old Tornado wants 
		to caramelize his crème brûlée.
Moe:		Yeah!  Do that!
Marge:		Somebody help him!
Homer:		Relax.  They got rodeo clowns.
		[cut to clown dressing room]
Clown 1:	Is my lipstick even?
Clown 2:	Go like this.  [smacks lips]
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Marge tries to save Jack's hide by calling the bull, but isn't able
% to get the animal's attention.

Homer:	That's not going to do it, Marge; you need something red.  
	[picks up Lisa, and waves her over the stadium railing]
	Hey, Toro!  Here's something to gore!
Lisa:	Da-a-ad!
Homer:	Not now, honey, Daddy's busy.
	[it works; the bull begins to charge toward Homer and 
	Lisa]
	[pulls Lisa back into the stadium] Now, for a little 
	calming blue.  [turns to Bart] Hey, where's your blue 
	shirt.
Bart:	I don't have a blue shirt.
-- Blue's for dolls, anyway, "Pokey Mom"

% The bull rams into the wall just underneath Homer, sending him
% tumbling to the ground, and kicks him into the guard tower.  This
% wakes up the guard, who wildly fires several rounds of tear gas into
% the audience.

Maybe it's the tear gas, or maybe this was the best damn prison rodeo 
ever.
-- Warden, "Pokey Mom"

% Later, the prison tries to patch up Homer so he can go home.

Marge:	How's your back, Homey?
Homer:	I can't complain.  [indicates a sign which reads, "No 
	Complaining"]
Warden:	Ah, that's for the prisoners.  You can complain all you 
	want.
Homer:	Oh, God, my back!  It hurts so much!  And my job is so 
	unfulfilling!
-- That should about cover it, "Pokey Mom"

% Marge tries to help Homer.

Marge:	Try to focus on something else.  You like Jimi Hendrix, 
	right?
Homer:	Uh-huh.
Marge:	Well, look at that painting.  [points to a portrait of 
	Hendrix] Wow, the artist really captured Jimi's passion 
	and intensity.
Homer:	And his fondness for the guitar.
Jack:	Thank you kindly, ma'am.  They won't give us art supplies, 
	so I had to paint it with pudding.
Marge:	A convict painted that?
Warden:	Yep.
Marge:	Well, I studied art, and this guy's got a real gift.
Warden:	You kiddin'?  Look -- [shows another painting] he painted 
	a unicorn in outer space.  I'm asking you:  What's it 
	breathin'?
Homer:	Air?
Warden:	Ain't no air in space.
Homer:	There's an air-in-space museum.
-- Or is that an Aaron Space Museum?  "Pokey Mom"

% The guards toss Homer out of prison.  He gets up and leaves with
% Marge.  On the way out, they pass convicts raking leaves into piles,
% except for Jack.  He has raked his multicolored leaves into a
% beautiful picture of a sunset, which impresses Marge.  She doesn't
% have long to appreciate Jack's artistry, as the wind kicks up and
% blows away the leaves.  Both he and Marge sigh sadly.
%
% Meanwhile, in the prison's exercise yard, Bart bench-presses some
% weights.

Lisa:	They are coming back for us, aren't they?
Bart:	I dunno.  [continues pumping iron]
-- If they don't, you can paint stuff with pudding, "Pokey Mom"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  4:55]
%
% The next day, Homer's still having back problems.

Lisa:	How's your back, Dad?
Homer:	Well, there's a dull ache, certainly.  And overlaid on 
	that is a club sandwich of pain.  Only instead of bacon, 
	there's agony.  Marge, could I have a BLT?
	[Marge is staring out the window]
	What are you looking at?
	[In her mind's eye, Marge sees Waterville State 
	Penitentiary]
Marge:	Oh, nothing.  How would you feel if I did some volunteer 
	work at the prison?
Homer:	First, I'd feel like having a BLT.  Then, proud of you.
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Marge arrives at the prison to teach her first class.

Marge:		Welcome to, "Freeing the Artist Within."  Not 
		literally, of course.  [chuckles.  Her students are 
		dead silent and stare at her.  We hear a shotgun 
		cocking]
		Okay.  Now, I wanted to paint fresh fruit, but the 
		prison cafeteria would only give me sauerkraut.  
		[empties a big can of sauerkraut onto a table.  The 
		prisoners make disgusted noises]
		That's depressing.  Let's let a little sunshine in.  
		[draws the shade.  The shadows of the bars fall on 
		the sauerkraut, making it look like it's in a cell.  
		The prisoners groan again]
		Oh.  [a prisoner raises his hand]
Prisoner:	Can I smell your dress?  [prisoners laugh]
Jack:		[grabs the prisoner by the collar] Hey!  You show 
		some respect -- this one here's not for smellin'.  
		[lets him go]
Marge:		Why, thank you, Jack.
Jack:		No problem.  Now, let's paint.
Prisoner:	[to Jack] Hey, can I smell your clothes?
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Homer visits Dr. Hibbert.

Hibbert:	[whistles] Your spine is more twisted than Sinbad's 
		take on marriage.  [chuckles]
Homer:		So?  Just give me some drugs and surgery.
Hibbert:	Oh, I'd love to but, uh, to be honest, modern 
		medicine has a lousy record of treating the back.  
		We spend too much time on the front.
Homer:		Yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front.
Hibbert:	I'm going to send you to my chiropractor.
Homer:		Hey, I thought real doctors hated chiropractors.
Hibbert:	Well, that is our official stance but between you, 
		me, and my golf clubs, they're miracle workers.
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Marge continues to guide her art students.  She advises one man to
% use a brushing stroke, rather than a stabbing motion, to paint a
% picture of a man killing a judge.  Next, she turns to Jack, who has
% created a painting of a stone angel statue coming to life and flying
% to the heavens.  She wonders how a sensitive soul like Jack wound up
% in the pokey.  Jack confesses that he shot Apu.  Marge does a deft
% job of rationalizing this, remarking that shooting Apu now carries
% only a US$100 fine.

Jack:	Maybe I belong in here.  I got a lot of anger.
Marge:	I don't see any anger.  [motions toward the painting] I 
	see a yearning for freedom.  Do you have a title?
Jack:	"A Time to Kill."
Marge:	Titles are hard.
-- These little comments are, too, "Pokey Mom"

% Homer takes Dr. Hibbert's referral to see Dr. Steve, a chiropractor. 
% Homer lies down, and Dr. Steve performs a spinal adjustment.

Homer:	Hey!  It feels a little better.
Steve:	Mmm-hmm.  I thought it might.  Now, I'll need to see you 
	three times a week for, uh ... [reads a chart] ... many 
	years.
-- "Pokey Mom"

% In the kitchen, Marge bakes a batch of cookies.

Lisa:	So, how was it in the slammer?
Marge:	Terrific.  Bart, Sideshow Bob says he'll be seeing you 
	real soon.
Bart:	[laughs] Oh, that Bob.
-- Coming attractions, "Pokey Mom"

% Marge tells the kids that Jack, her "diamond in the rough," is up
% for parole.  The cookies are to help win the favor of the parole
% board.  Bart asks for one, but Marge tells him he has to finish his
% sundae.  Bart reluctantly takes a couple more bites.
%
% Jack's parole hearing convenes.

Jack:	I'm sure your macaroons are scrumptious, Marge, but I've 
	seen this warden turn down brownies -- honest-to-goodness 
	brownies.
Warden:	Next.  [eats a cookie, then sees the next man is Jack]
	Oh, it's you.  Well, just let me ink up my old "denied" 
	stamp.
Marge:	Warden, please.  This man is a gentle soul.  I know he's 
	made mistakes, but someone with his talent belongs on a 
	boardwalk doing caricatures, not behind bars.
Warden:	Lady, I know he charmed you with some "please"s and "thank 
	you"s, but he wasn't so polite to the guy he shot.
Apu:	Actually, he was.  He waited with me 'till the ambulance 
	came, then ran like a deer.
Warden:	Well, that's mighty nice, but if I let this creep out, 
	would you like him skulking around your neighborhood?
Marge:	Honestly, it wouldn't bother me.
	[the parole board members confer amongst themselves]
Warden:	Well, lady, I'm gonna call your bluff.  The prisoner is 
	hereby paroled into your custody.  [bangs gavel]
Marge:	[gasps] Oh, oh my goodness.
Jack:	I'm free?  [tries hugging her, but accidentally chokes her 
	with his handcuffs] Jeez, I'm sorry.  Sorry!  [loops the 
	chain of his handcuffs over Marge's hair, so he can hug 
	her without killing her] You won't regret this.
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Marge lets Jack bunk in her basement.

Marge:	I hope this is okay.  It's not very prison-y.
Jack:	It's more than I deserve, ma'am.  Now, which way is Mecca, 
	'cause I got to do a little praying.
Marge:	Uh, Mecca?  Well, let--
Jack:	[laughs] No, I'm just yanking your chain.  I'm Jewish.
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Homer rakes up some leaves and puts them in a trash can, which
% aggravates his back condition.

Homer:	Oh, my back!  Dr. Steve didn't do anything.
Bart:	Did you do those exercises he gave you?
Homer:	Yeah, right.  I did 'em while you were studying.
	[the both laugh.  Bart gives Homer a high five, and Homer 
	falls backward over a trash can] Oh!  Ow!
Bart:	Dad?  Are you okay?
Homer:	Yeah.  In fact, [gets up] I feel fantastic.  [does a 
	little dance]
Bart:	That trash can must have un-kinked your back.
Homer:	Not trash can, son -- Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-
	Cylinder!  [protectively] Patent pending.
-- Homer protects his intellectual property rights, "Pokey Mom"

% At dinner, Homer explains that the dents in his can -- er -- Spine-
% O-Cylinder exactly match the "vertebrain" in the human spine.  He
% notices that Jack is a guest for dinner, and isn't too happy that an
% ex-con has seen his unpatented invention.  Fortunately for Homer,
% Jack has no designs on Homer's invention.  He just wants a job. 
% Marge thinks for a moment, and then has an idea:  Jack can get a job
% at Springfield Elementary.
%
% Homer starts treating patients with his Spine-O-Cylinder.

Lenny:	So, Homer.  You think you can fix my sciatica?
Homer:	I don't know what that is, so I'm going to say, "yes."  
	Now, go limp.
Lenny:	I'm limp.
Homer:	One, two, better not sue.  [pushes Lenny backward over the 
	trashcan]
Lenny:	Ow.  Hey, it worked!  My searing leg pain is now a gentle 
	numbness.  [leaves]
Homer:	Next!
Frink:	Yes.  Uh, my car seems to have broken down, and I was 
	wondering if I could use your-- [Homer pushes him over the 
	can] Oh, that's a pushing motion ...
Steve:	[walks in] Simpson!  You're not a licensed chiropractor, 
	and you're stealing patients from me and from Dr. Steffi.
Homer:	Boy, talk about irony.  The AMA tries to drive you guys 
	out of business, now you're doing the same to me.  Think 
	about the irony.
Steve:	[grabs Homer by the collar] You've been warned.  Stop 
	chiropracting.
Homer:	Not unless you think about the irony.
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Marge goes to bat for Jack at the Elementary School.  She arranges a
% meeting with Principal Skinner, Jack, and herself.

Marge:		I read in the "Daily Fourth Gradian" that you need 
		someone to paint a mural.
Skinner:	Yeah -- school spirit is down 3.4%.
Marge:		Well, Jack here will do great work for you.
Skinner:	Oh, any references?
Jack:		Well, to be honest with you, I spent the last six 
		years in Waterville State.
Marge:		[quickly jumping in] It's a small liberal arts 
		college.  Very law-abiding.  No convicts at all.
Skinner:	Well, the only other one to apply was Moe Szyslak 
		and his stuff scares the hell out of me.  [unfolds, 
		and looks at, a small drawing Moe did] Eugh.  How 
		can anyone consider *that* making love?  [turns to 
		Jack and Marge] All right, Jack -- you're hired.  
		I'll clear you out a cubby.  [leaves]
Jack:		You told a lie for me.
Marge:		I know.  But the Lord will forgive me if it will 
		help you get a second chance.
Jack:		Actually, Marge, it's a third if you count that farm 
		couple.
Marge:		Farm couple?
Jack:		But I've got a really good feeling about this one 
		Marge, I really do.
Marge:		[nervously] Mmmmmm.
-- Third time's the charm, "Pokey Mom"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:19]
%
% Jack is close to finishing his mural, which shows a warrior princes
% riding a fierce puma.  The kids really dig it.

Finally -- art that doesn't suck!
-- Nelson, "Pokey Mom"

% Skinner has a dissenting opinion.

Skinner:	Dear Lord, what are you doing?
Jack:		You don't like it?
Skinner:	No, no, it's all wrong.  The shapely female form has 
		no place in art.
Jack:		But, what I thought is --
Skinner:	I sketched out exactly what I wanted.
Jack:		Yeah, I know, but see what I was going for here -- 
Skinner:	Did you even look at the napkin?  [unfolds a napkin, 
		which has Skinner's concept for the mural drawn on 
		it.  It's a cloying picture of a happy cartoon puma 
		holding hands with a boy and girl, walking under a 
		rainbow]
		Oh, I was in the zone that day.
Jack:		Yeah.  You see, I didn't want to go so cutsey-
		wutsey.
Skinner:	Because ... ?
Jack:		Because it's not my ... style.
Skinner:	Well, if you want to keep your job you'll *make* it 
		your style.
Jack:		All right.  You're the boss man, ain't ya?
Skinner:	Darn right, I'm the boss.  Don't forget, I can send 
		you back where you came from, college boy.
		[Jack sighs and begins to whitewash his old mural]
-- Artistic differences, "Pokey Mom"

% Jack works out his frustrations by doing pull-ups in the basement. 
% Marge encourages him to go along with Skinner's demands, at least
% until he establishes himself as an artist.  Jack agrees.  He also
% asks Marge for permission to make booze in the washing machine. 
% Marge insists he finish his sundae first.  As Jack reluctantly eats
% the dessert, Marge wonders what the problem is with her sundaes.
%
% In the garage, Homer finishes treating Moe's back.

Homer:	Okay, that should do it, Moe.
Moe:	Hey, it don't hurt no more.  Now I can focus on my 
	crippling emotional pain.  [looks off in the distance] Oh, 
	Daddy, Daddy, why?  Why won't you hug me?  You hugged the 
	mailman.
	[two well-dressed men enter the garage]
Man 1:	Excuse me, sir, is this "El Clinico Magnifico?"
Homer:	Ah, you saw our bus ad.
Man 2:	We'd, uh, like to invest in your spinal adjustment device.
Homer:	We might be able to do business.  [giggles to himself]
Man 1:	We'll need to take some photographs.  [the two men take 
	the Spine-O-Cylinder and walk out of the garage]
	[Homer tries to stop them by closing the garage door, but 
	the men limbo under it]
Homer:	Wait a minute -- no investor can bend like that.
Moe:	They're chiropractors!
	[outside, the two men are bashing the Cylinder with 
	doctors' models of the spinal cord.  Dr. Steve waits in a 
	nearby truck]
Steve:	C'mon, c'mon, let's go!  [the two men get in the truck, 
	which peels out]
Homer:	No!  My Spine-O-Cylinder!  They'll pay for what they did 
	to my can.
Moe:	[consoling] Forget it, Homer.  It's Chiro-town.
-- Hell of a welcome wagon, "Pokey Mom"

% Skinner dedicates the new mural.

Skinner:	You know, when Superintendent Chalmers suggested a 
		school mural, I almost thought he said a, "school 
		Muriel."
		[Skinner laughs, but the audience is dead silent]
		Muriel's his sister.  And, uh ...  [shotgun cocks]
		Well, thank you, Bruce Vilanch.
Vilanch:	Whoopi would've made it work.
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Skinner unveils the mural, which is a professionally-done version of
% what he sketched on the napkin.  The students' reaction to the
% painting is as dismissive as Crowley's.  Even Flanders thinks the
% drawing is too sugary.

Chalmers:	Skinner!  How are we going to raise school spirit 
		with this sappy hokum.
Skinner:	I know sir, it's an embarrassment.  [to Jack] This 
		isn't what I wanted.  Where's the edge?
Jack:		I followed your napkin.
Skinner:	No napkin can wipe the crumbs of failure from your 
		mouth.
Marge:		Now, don't fight.  All great art is controversial at 
		first, but years from now, people will point to 
		these cuddly little creatures and say, "That's a 
		Jack Crowley."
		[Jack growls softly]
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Skinner plans the school lunch menu.

Skinner:	Now, uh, pizza's working well on Thursday, but I 
		think the kids will follow it to Tuesday.
Willie:		That's what you said about the stuffed peppers, and 
		you lost the young males.
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Just then Milhouse runs into the room, warning that the school is on
% fire.  Specifically, it is the mural that is burning, leading
% Skinner to suspect that Jack is the culprit.  Marge tries to defend
% Jack, but accidentally lets it slip that he's an ex-convict.  "Dear
% Lord," Skinner says, "I've peed in front of him!"
%
% The old mural burns off, miraculously revealing the original
% painting.  This one is a big hit with the kids.  Not for long,
% though, because this mural goes up in flames, too.
%
% The Fire Department arrives and extinguishes the wall.  Skinner
% wants Crowley back behind bars.

Skinner:	That felon could have torched the whole school, were 
		it not stuffed with asbestos.
Wiggum:		We'll catch Crowley.  And then he'll learn the fine 
		art of police brutality.
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Marge finds Jack hiding in a play pipe.  He assures her that he
% didn't burn the mural, and Marge hatches a plan to help him out. 
% Carrying a paper bag, she approaches Skinner and Wiggum.

Marge:		Oh, Chief!  I found some evidence that points to the 
		real arsonist.  [points to the bag]
Wiggum:		Well, let's see it.
Marge:		Not yet.  You have to guess what it is.
Skinner:	We don't have time for guessing games!
Wiggum:		Nah, let's try it.  It might be fun.  Is it DNA?
Marge:		[noncommittal] Hrmm.
Wiggum:		So, it's like DNA.  Um, a hatchet?
Skinner:	You had a turn.  I want to guess.
Marge:		[looks offscreen] Oh, Jeez ...
		[cut to Skinner's car, which is ablaze.  Jack, 
		holding a gas can, dances around it maniacally]
Skinner:	My car!
Jack:		[cackles] Puma pride!  Puma pride!  [laughs] Catch 
		the fever, Skinner!
-- That's going to hurt his case, "Pokey Mom"

% Jack, naturally, is arrested.  As he sits in the back of Wiggum's
% cruiser, Marge gives him a piece of her mind.

Marge:	You crumb-bum!  You looked me right in the eye and lied to 
	me.
Jack:	Marge, this is the God's truth:  I burned the mural, but I 
	did not burn Skinner's car.
Marge:	I just saw you!  Get him out of here, Chief.
Wiggum:	Yes, ma'am.
-- "Pokey Mom"

% Wiggum and Jack drive into the sunset.

Wiggum:	My wife and I like watching that "Oz" show on HBO.  Uh, is 
	... is prison really like that?
Jack:	Wouldn't know.  We only get basic cable.
Wiggum:	Ouch.  I also like that "Sex in the City."  None of those 
	girls looks like my wife.  [laughs]
Jack:	"Sportscenter's" not bad.
Wiggum:	Yeah, I never got that show.
Jack:	What's to get?  They just tell the scores.
Wiggum:	Yeah, I suppose, yeah.  Hey, ya meet any Mob guys?  Are 
	they really like the Sopranos?
Jack:	I told you, we just get basic cable.
Wiggum:	Oh right, right, right.  Listen, if I'm getting too 
	chatty, just, uh, just tell me to shut up.
Jack:	Ah, I'm enjoying it.  Hey, you ever watch them strongman 
	contests?  They're pretty good.  Those guys look strong.  
	Other guys in prison say they're gay, but I don't know;
