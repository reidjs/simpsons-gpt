% McBain, flying a UNICEF plane, is under attack by five "Comi-Nazi" fighter
% jets. One plane fires a missile at McBain's plane, and the back end 
% explodes.

They won't stop me from delivering these UNICEF pennies! (he lifts up a 
pallet and throws it out the plane) Go, pennies! Help the puny children who 
need you!
-- McBain, pilot extraordinaire, "King of the Hill"

% While he is throwing the pennies, he rips his shirt, and we see his
% six-pack. Bart is lying on the rug watching this on the TV, with Homer 
% sitting on the couch.

 Bart: Wow! McBain is really buffed up! You could grate cheese on those abs!
Homer: Yeah, but can he do this?
       [Homer takes a drink from a beer can on his stomach, then crushes the 
       can between the folds of fat.]
 Bart: [shudders]
-- The abilities of Homer's stomach... "King of the Hill"

% Back to the TV. McBain jumps out of the plane, still on fire, towards the
% Comi-Nazis' planes. He lands on one and breaks its window. The pilot 
% surrenders, but McBain breaks his neck anyway.

Marge: (walking in) That's what I call break-neck speed! (laughs)
 Bart: Mom, a man just died.
Marge: Hmmmm... anyway, it's time for the church picnic.
Homer: What? They had a picnic last week.
Marge: No, they didn't! You just brought a bucket of chicken to church!
Homer: If God didn't want us to eat in church, he'd have made gluttony a 
       sin.
-- Homer, professor of theology, "King of the Hill"

% Cut to Jebediah Springfield Park. OFF drives in for the church picnic, but
% it's also the Annual Policeman's Picnic and the Annual Mafia Picnic. The
% police and the mob are seated at facing picnic tables, and when Legs 
% shoots the police's mustard, it turns out they shot their own mustard; 
% Chief Wiggum had borrowed it from the Mafia's table. Legs exclaims, "Aw, 
% nuts!"
%
% Homer continues driving, and parks on the baseball field, to the distaste 
% of the players on the field. Homer ignores them and goes to the nearby 
% picnic table.

Lovejoy: Nice to see you, Homer.
  Homer: [shoving Rev. Lovejoy out of the way] Yeah, out of the way, whoever 
         You are, you're blocking the food.
-- Hungry, hungry Homer, "King of the Hill"

% Meanwhile, Ralph and another black boy are playing tag. They run past Mr.
% Burns' car, who is inside using a three-faced mirror to tan his face. Mr.
% Burns inquires about his kite; Smithers pretends it is "soaring 
% majestically" but in reality it is lying in a heap on the ground. Then 
% Ralph runs up the back of the car and taps Mr. Burns through the sunroof.

Ralph: You're it!
Burns: We'll see about that. After him, Smithers!
-- Playing tag at the Church Picnic, "King of the Hill"

% Smithers steps on the gas, and Ralph runs like hell shouting "You're not 
% it!"
%
% Then we see most of the children of Springfield, including Milhouse, Jimbo 
% and Nelson, lined up in a semicircle with Bart and Rod in the middle. The 
% game is "capture the flag", and Rod chooses Todd. Bart takes Nelson, 
% despite Milhouse's protests. Then Rod picks his dad. Ned deliberates this:

    Ned: Sports on a Sunday? I'd better ask Reverend Love-
Lovejoy: Oh, just play the damn game, Ned!
-- Another biblical dilemma resolved, "King of the Hill"

% Bart argues that if Rod gets an adult, so does he, and promptly picks 
% Homer, who is sitting on the ground next to a portable toilet. Bart tries 
% to get him to play, but he says "Daddy's down for the day", but when Bart 
% says Flanders is playing, Homer promptly hauls himself up. In the process, 
% he knocks over the toilet, revealing Comic Book Guy sitting inside reading 
% a "Zebra Girl" comic.

Oh, it appears I will have to find a new fortress of solitude.
-- Comic Book Guy's dilemma, "King of the Hill"

% Five of the kids are guarding the Simpson flag. Homer suggests surrender, 
% but Bart has a plan requiring Homer's underpants. He uses them as a 
% pretend flag, and runs, shouting "I got it! I got the flag!" The kids run 
% after Bart, while Homer steals the real flag. The kids pin Bart down, but 
% they realise it's not the real thing. Homer runs for the finishing line, 
% but the kids chase him and gain on him. He collapses just inches from the 
% line.

I don't think he can get up. Let's egg him!
-- Nelson, sympathetic as ever, "King of the Hill"

% Homer turns over and sees Bart ashamed of him. That night in bed, while 
% Marge is reading, Homer vibrates his fat and sighs.

Homer: Oh Marge, how could you let me let myself go like this?
Marge: Me? I'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.
Homer: Well I've humiliated my son for the last time. I'm going to get into 
       shape.
Marge: Whatever you say, sweetie.
Homer: No, I mean it, I'm really serious this time.
Marge: OK, honey, OK. I'll start taking in all your slacks! [laughs]
-- Homer decides to get into shape, "King of the Hill"

% Later that night, Homer is still awake. He has to push down on his stomach 
% to be able to see that it's 1:00. He gets up quietly, and puts on his 
% running gear on the step at the front door, while accidentally letting the 
% cat in. He starts running, but collapses at the Flanders' mailbox. Santa's 
% Little Helper drags him in and onto a chair. He looks at a picture of 
% Bart.

Look son, Daddy got in shape! [he knocks over the picture] I've got to keep 
trying. Or I could just move that picture... No! The picture looked good
where it was. Boy! Drag me back outside.
-- Homer talking to a photograph, "King of the Hill"

% SLH does so and they both go running. Unfortunately, a paper boy starts 
% cycling alongside them, and each newspaper he throws hits Homer on the 
% head. Then a "Springfield News" van pulls alongside, and a man starts 
% throwing bundles of papers onto the ground. Can you guess where they hit?
% You got it - Homer's head.
%
% Homer then runs into the Kwik-E-Mart. Apu is standing at his post, but he
% is snoring. Homer coughs suggestively.

  Apu: So what will it be Mr. Homer? Your usual bucket of ice cream covered
       with miniature pies?
Homer: Don't you have anything healthy here?
  Apu: Oh, well, we do have some low-salt candy bars and some reduced fat 
       soda, and our beef jerky is now nearly rectum-free!
Homer: Hey, these Powersauce bars look pretty healthy.
  Apu; Oh yes, that is a new item. No bar contains more apple sauce.
Homer: [reading] "A bushel of apples packed in every bar, plus a secret 
       ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples." Wow!
-- Homer buying... gasp! Healthy food? - "King of the Hill"

% Homer eats one of these bars as he is jogging. He sees an "All-Night Gym". 
% He wonders what a "gyme" is, so he goes inside.

Oh, right, a "gyme".
-- Homer at the gym, "King of the Hill"

% Only one other person is there, lifting dumbbells. Homer starts using a 
% weights machine, but he uses it the wrong way. He lies in such a way that 
% every time he drops the weight it hits him on the head.

             Homer: Phew, my head's gonna be sore in the morning.
Rainier Wolfcastle: Excuse me, you're doing this station all backwards. Let 
                    me show you how to do it like a man.
             Homer: Rainier Wolfcastle! Oh, I love our movies and your 
                    Powersauce bars and your taught...
Rainier Wolfcastle: Hey, hey, that's enough. Now step over to the 
                    abdominator and I will shout slogans at you.
-- Homer meets Rainier Wolfcastle at the gym, "King of the Hill"

% He does so. Two months later, Homer is using the dumbbells and is in much 
% better shape; his arms are muscular, not flabby. He thanks "Wolfy" for 
% helping him. Back at home, he looks at himself in the mirror. He flexes 
% his muscles, ripping his shirt.

 Lisa: Dad! What have you done to your stomach?
 Bart: And your chest?
Marge: And your shirt?
Homer: I have been working out secretly at night. And look at me now!
Marge: Oh, my goodness gracious!
Homer: Go on, try to find some flab.
-- Homer tells the family about the "gyme", "King of the Hill"

% Unfortunately, they all manage to find some. Homer resigns himself and 
% asks "just feel my bicep". Bart goes so and is lifted off the ground while 
% Marge and Lisa look on in awe. Bart gets scared when Homer lifts him too 
% close to the fan. Later, at the kitchen table, Homer tries to dissuade 
% Marge and the kids from eating "that filth", i.e. Marge's casserole.

I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its
awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing 5 pounds of spaghetti 
into one handy mouth-sized bar.
 [He eats the bar and swallows. He then dials the phone.]
Hospital, please.
-- Homer eating a spaghetti-bar, "King of the Hill"

% Back at the gym, Homer is lifting weights with his feet.

Rainier: Homer, can you please remember to wipe your sweat off the machine? 
         I got a terrible rash yesterday.
   Bart: Wow, you know Rainier Wolfcastle?
  Homer: Yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone.
-- Bart meets Rainier Wolfcastle, "King of the Hill"

% Two Powersauce representatives, Brad and Neil, approach Rainier Wolfcastle 
% and ask him to climb the Murderhorn, the highest mountain in Springfield, 
% as a promotion for Powersauce. Rainier says they're crazy. "Not for all 
% the apple sauce in Glückenschabbel".

% Bart says that Homer could do it. "He eats $50 worth of Powersauce bars a 
% day". Brad and Neil agree. They congratulate Homer: "You're going to be 
% the first man to climb the Murderhorn". He looks out the window and sees 
% one mountain, but it's actually a much higher one to the right. It 
% stretches up to the clouds. Bart gives him the thumbs up.
%
% Back at home, he packs his supplies for the climb. Grampa runs in.

Grampa: Son, don't go up that mountain! You'll die up there like I did!
 Homer: You? Did?
Grampa: Sure.
-- Grampa, master of the afterlife, "King of the Hill"

% Grampa describes how McAllister and he were sponsored to climb the 
% mountain in the winter of '28. Near the top, McAllister stole the supplies 
% and headed for the top alone, sending Grampa falling 8,000 feet onto a 
% pile of jagged rocks.

Grampa: Of course, folks were tougher in those days. I was jitterbugging 
        that very night. But that skunk McAllister was never seen again.
 Homer: If you're trying to scare me, it won't work. I'm 100% focused on my 
        goal. (picks up his cap) Hey, my hat has ear-flaps.
-- Homer, focused on his goal... "King of the Hill"

% Brad addresses the press at the bottom of the Murderhorn. Homer says he 
% owes it all to Powersauce. Marge says, "This is all crazy", but Neil 
% assures her that they are sending two Sherpas along as guides.

Sherpa 1: (subtitled) I foresaw your death last night.
Sherpa 2: (subtitled) Stop saying that.
-- Homer's 'guides', "King of the Hill"

Homer: Well, goodbye everyone. Don't touch my stuff.
 Bart: Dad, wait. You're not risking your life just to impress me, are you?
Homer: Well, yes.
 Bart: Woah, cool. Now get going. Chop, chop!
-- Homer says goodbye to the family, "King of the Hill"

% Homer starts walking. Meanwhile, Brad talks to the Sherpas.

Remember our agreement - he can't fail.
-- Brad to the Sherpas, "King of the Hill"

% Homer is on his thirteenth oxygen bottle, and he's just a few feet up. But 
% he manages to get up quite high before nightfall. Bart, sitting on the 
% house roof with a telescope tells him that he only has four vertical miles 
% to go. Homer sleeps, but he is being dragged up the mountain by the 
% Sherpas. He wakes up, amazed that he's climbed so far. He kicks the 
% Sherpas.

   Homer: Come on, you lazy Sherpas, wake up! We've got a mountain to climb.
Sherpa 1: (subtitled) He shouldn't kick us.
Sherpa 2: (subtitled) His toes will fall off soon.
-- Homer's wake up call, "King of the Hill"

% A Powersauce newsbreak on the television tells the family that Homer's 
% passed the halfway point. The next night, while the Sherpas are dragging 
% him up, Homer's sleeping bag is dragged off by accident. Then his pants.
% Then his undershorts. When he feels his skin against the snow, he wakes 
% up. He is indignant with the Sherpas - he thinks no one believes in him.

   Homer: I'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own!
Sherpa 1: Then technically, shouldn't you go back down and start all over?
   Homer: Shut up! You are so fired.
-- Homer fires the Sherpas, "King of the Hill"

% Homer radios into base telling Brad and Neil that he's going solo. Brad 
% says he's crazy, but Homer's got his Powersauce bars.

 Neil: Wake up, Homer! Those bars are just junk! They're made of apple cores 
       and Chinese newspapers!
Homer: (reading a Powersauce bar) Hey, Deng Xiaoping died!
-- The truth about Powersauce bars, "King of the Hill"

% Nevertheless, he defies them, saying he'll be at the top by noon. In a
% Powersauce newsbreak, Brad claims Homer has switched to the "Vita-Peach 
% Health Lock", and may not have the "mega-nutrients" he needs to reach the 
% top.

 Bart: Oh, Dad's gonna die and it's all my fault!
Marge: Don't worry, kids, your father will be just fine as long as he's with 
       those Sherpas.

% But Lisa points out the two Sherpas across the road from their house 
% hitching a ride to Nepal. Meanwhile, Homer becomes light-headed, and 
% hallucinates, when he's really sliding down the mountain. He regains his 
% composure and climbs: he only has a few feet to go, and he makes it. "I 
% did it! I made it all the way to th... aw, crap!" It's not the top at all 
% - there's another massive section yet to climb. He gets cold, so he goes 
% inside a nearby cave. He finds the body of C.W. McAllister, out of whom 
% Grampa had taken a bite.
%
% Homer realises that just as his dad is a disgrace to him, he's a disgrace 
% to Bart. He plants the "Simpson" flag from the Capture the Flag game at 
% the level he has reached. He drives it into the mountain with a hammer, 
% but in doing so, he accidentally induces a massive rockfall, where all of 
% the higher section of the mountain breaks off and falls. He realises he's 
% on the new top.

I actually did it - I climbed the unclimbable mountain! (shouting) Bow down
before me everyone, for I am your king!
-- Homer at the peak of the Murderhorn, "King of the Hill"

% He then sleds down the mountain on McAllister's body to a waiting crowd. 
% Dr. Hibbert examines the body.

Hibbert: It's too late... he's dead. Looks like someone tried to take a bite 
         out of him...
 Grampa: What are you looking at me for? You're all crazy, crazy as...
         (his teeth fall out and attach themselves to the bite marks)
         OK. Here's what I think happened. (runs away)
-- The end of C.W. McAllister finally revealed, "King of the Hill"

% Bart asks if Homer made it. He looks through a telescope, and sees a 
% flagpole, but no flag. But despite that, Bart thinks he's the coolest dad 
% ever. Marge looks through the telescope and asks Homer, "Is that your 
% wallet?" D'oh!
