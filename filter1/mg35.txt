% Bart sits at the kitchen island, the cookie jar in front of him.
% He checks that the coast is clear, then reaches for the jar.
% Marge pops up behind him.

M: Bart!
B: Woaugh!

% Bart has been caught with his hand literally in the cookie jar.

M: Take your hand out of that cookie jar!

% Bart does so, with a cookie in his hand.  Marge slaps his hand (Bart
% drops the cookie back into the jar) and replaces the lid.

B: Oh, man.
M: That jar is off-limits, Bart.
   And if I catch you with so much as one cookie...
B: [heavy sarcasm] Whoa, I'm scared.

% Homer magically appears.

H: Bart!

% Homer leans in to make his point.

H: [menacingly] Lay off those cookies.

% Bart swallows hard.  Marge and Homer leave.
%
% Bart checks that the coast is clear and reaches into the jar, pulling out
% a handful of cookies and dropping them on the counter.  Lisa pops up from
% behind the refrigerator.

L: Mom!  Dad!  Bart's eating cookies!

% Lisa (the snitch) makes her escape as Bart frantically tosses the cookies
% back into the jar.

B: Whew!

% Then he spots a cookie still on the counter that eluded him.

B: Yaaargh!

% Bart covers it with a bowl just as Homer and Marge enter.

M: What's under that bowl, Bart?
B: Nuthin'.
H: Lift up the bowl, boy.

% Bart nervously drums his fingers.  He reaches under the table and
% produces two more bowls.  He quickly shuffles the three bowls on
% the table.

H: [points] That one.

% Bart lifts the near bowl.  Nothing.  He replaces the bowl.

M: [points] That one.

% Bart lifts the far bowl.  Nothing.  He replaces the bowl.

B: Hey, look over there!

% Like total idiots, Homer and Marge look behind them, and Bart takes
% the opportunity to shuffle the bowls some more.

M: What?
B: Ohhhhhhhh, nuthin'.

% Homer thinks he's figured it out.

H: [excitedly, with glee]  Middle one!  Middle one!

% Bart lifts it.  Nothing.

H: Huh?

% Bart replaces the bowl.

M: Oh well, I guess he's innocent.

% Bart sees them out and returns...

B: Huh?

% ... to find Maggie shuffling the bowls.

B: Uh... That one.

% Nothing under the near bowl.

B: Uh... That one.

% Nothing under the far bowl.

B: Then, that one!

% Nothing under the middle bowl, either.

B: Hey!  Where's the cookie?

% Maggie opens her mouth and sticks out her tongue, the cookie balanced
% atop it.  She then closes her mouth and munches away.
