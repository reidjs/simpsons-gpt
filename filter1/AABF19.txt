	[to his family, who have walked up to join Homer]  Mindy 
	and I are just hammering out a payment plan.  [to the 
	fleeing helicopter] We'll talk Monday!
-- Homer Simpson, novice negotiator, "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% Aboard the chopper, the executives rejoice in their victory.  The 
% pilot mentions that they seem to be carrying a little too much 
% weight.  Suddenly a crazed sheep pops up from behind the seat, and 
% attacks the executives.  The helicopter flies out of control and 
% crashes with a ball of flame into the side of a mountain.  The sheep 
% bounds away from the crash site.
%
% With no more crops, there's no more reason to stay down on the farm.  
% So, the family drives back to Springfield.  Homer wonders why he 
% left.  The persistent colonel camped out on his lawn quickly reminds 
% him.
%
% The moment of truth has finally arrived.  Homer and the colonel, 
% each armed with a pistol, start to duel on the front lawn.

Colonel:	[pacing] Five, six, seven, eight, I say, eight, 
		nine, and ... ten.  [sniffs the air] What is that 
		intoxicating aroma.  Could that, I say, could that 
		be mincemeat pie?
Marge:		It certainly is.  Why don't you put down your gun 
		and have a slice?
Colonel:	Oh, don't mind if I do?
Homer:		Hey, are we dueling or what?
Colonel:	Oh, where are my manners?  [shoots Homer in the arm]
Homer:		[cries out in pain]
Lisa:		[holding a pie] Are you okay, Dad?
Homer:		I think so.  The bone stopped the bullet.
Lisa:		Dad, this might be one of those things you should go 
		to the hospital for.
Homer:		After pie.  [eats a slice]
