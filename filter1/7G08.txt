% (carrying Maggie, all bundled up) and Homer try to reach their seats.
% Next up is the second grade, presenting, ``Santas of many lands.''  After
% the German and Japanese versions of Santa Claus comes Lisa as Towanga,
% the Santa Claus of the South Seas.  Lisa appears, wearing a witch doctor
% mask and grass skirt, juggling flaming torches.
%
% The fourth grade is next, singing Jingle Bells, but Bart chooses some
% alternate lyrics.  He's yanked off the stage.  Time passes...

Skinner: The fifth grade will now favor us with a scene from Charles

Homer:   Ohhhh.... How many grades does this school have!

% ain't Santa.''  Lisa's list is, ``A pony.  A pony.  A pony.  A pony.
% Thank you,'' the same list as the past three years, and Marge tries
% to explain to Lisa that a pony won't fit in Santa's sleigh.  Bart hands
% his list.

Marge: A tattoo?
Homer: A what?
Bart:  Yeah, they're cool, and they last for the rest of your lives.
Marge: You will <not> be getting a tattoo for Christmas.
Homer: Yeah, if you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your

Marge: [in bed, reading the shopping list]
       I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me Homer.
Homer: Huh?  Oh, I love you Marge.
Marge: Mm, Homer, you tell me that all the time.
Homer: Oh good, because I <do> love you.
       I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit

Marge: Well, I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus.

% Barney is on his way to Springfield Downs.  He's got a hot tip on a dog
% in the fourth race.  Whirlwind, a 12--1 shot.  Homer isn't so sure.

Bart:  Aw come on, Dad.  This could be the miracle that saves the Simpsons'
       Christmas.  If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always
       happen to poor kids at Christmas.  It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened
       to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's going to happen
       to us!

% Homer, Bart, and Barney arrive at Springfield Downs.  In the fourth race,
% there's been a scratch.  The replacement is a dog named Santa's Little
% Helper.  Homer figures, with a name like that, it can't lose.  The odds
% are 99--1.  Bart isn't so sure that this is a great idea, but he
% reluctantly lends his support.
%
% Back at home, the Happy Little Elves are happy again, and Lisa is pleased.
% Patty bad-mouths Homer.

Lisa:  What, Aunt Patty?
Patty: Oh, nothing, dear.  I'm just trashing your father.
Lisa:  Well, I wish you wouldn't because, aside from the fact that he has the
       same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have.
       Therefore, he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will
       govern the prospects of my adult relationships.
       So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me,
       and I am far too young to defend myself against such onslaughts.
Patty: Mm hm.  Go watch your cartoon show, dear.
-- ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

% The race is run, and SLH is dead last.  Way, way behind the rest of the pack.

Don't worry, Dad.  Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens.

% Whirlwind wins.  SLH doesn't even make it to the finish line.

It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.

% Outside, Homer and Bart go through the discarded tickets in search of

% SLH's owner tells the dog to scram, and SLH leaps into Homer's arms.

% Homer finally arrives home, and admits that he didn't get a bonus at all.
