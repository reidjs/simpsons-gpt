 Wiggum: Yes.  I mean -- um, I mean, no.  No, heh.
-- "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% Frink draws a strange diagram on the wall.

    Lisa: Well, where's my Dad?
   Frink: Well, it should be obvious to even the most dim-witted
          individual who holds an advanced degree in hyperbolic
          topology, n'gee, that Homer Simpson has stumbled into...[the
          lights go off] the third dimension.
    Lisa: [turning the lights back on] Sorry.
   Frink: [drawing on a blackboard] Here is an ordinary square --
  Wiggum: Whoa, whoa -- slow down, egghead!
   Frink: -- but suppose we exte-end the square beyond the two
          dimensions of our universe (along the hypothetical Z axis,
          there).
Everyone: [gasps]
   Frink: This forms a three-dimensional object known as a "cube", or a
          "Frinkahedron" in honor of its discoverer, n'hey, n'hey.
   Homer: [disembodied] Help me!  Are you helping me, or are you going
          on and on?
   Frink: Oh, right.  And, of course, within, we find the doomed
          individual.
-- The frightening conclusion, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

Wiggum: Enough of your borax, poindexter!  We need action --
         [fires his gun six times through the wall]
        Take that, you lousy dimension!
         [the bullets fly toward Homer, but spiral around the widening
        hole and get sucked into it]
 Homer: Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics.  I wish I'd
        read that book by that wheelchair guy.
-- Homer, Hawking ignoramus, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% He leans into the hole, but his head gets sucked in and elongated
% grotesquely.  He manages to pull it out, but the hole begins widening
% with an alarming rapidity.  He has to run to keep ahead of it.

  Abe: [wearing a diving suit] I'll save Homer!  All I needs is four
       stout men to work the bellows.
Frink: No, pops, it's too risky!  For all we know, there could be cubes
       in there the size of gorillas and other large --
Homer: [disembodied] Help!  I don't have much time.
 Bart: [tying a rope around his waist] That does it.  I'm going in.
Marge: Bart, no!
        [Bart goes in through the wall and looks around]
 Bart: Cool, man!
-- Bart enters 3D land, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% Homer is nearing the edge of the green grid.

  Homer: [panicky] Oh my God, I'm going to be sucked into a black hole,
         I'm going to be sucked into oblivion, I'm going to be nothing,
         and what's going to be coming out the other side, I don't know!
   Bart: I'll save you, Dad!
          [climbs onto XYZ street sign]
         I can't get any closer...you'll have to jump!
  Homer: Piece of cake, son.
          [runs into hole, breaks into pieces]
         Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap --
          [the world explodes in a flash as Bart gets pulled back]
  Marge: Bart!  What happened?
   Bart: Well...we hit a little snag when the universe sort of collapsed
         on itself.  But Dad seemed cautiously optimistic!
  Homer: [disembodied] Craaaap!
  Marge: Oh, Homey.
Lovejoy: Be strong, Marge: I'm sure he's gone to a better place.
          [lightening fizzles; Homer appears in our world, screaming,
         and falls into a dumpster]
  Homer: D'oh!  [gets out] Ew...this is the worst place yet.
-- He's got that right., "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% He walks down a street somewhere in California.  People stop to look
% at the stranger from another universe.  Homer whimpers incoherently as
% he keep walking, but then he spots a store he likes.  "Ooh!  Erotic
% cakes," he coos, walking in.

% The credits are displayed in green as the camera slowly rises over the

% video game "Myst".  Similar-style music plays over the Gracie logo.
