        was infested with thousands, upon thousands of rats.

Homer: Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
  Ned: Ho ho ho, suckin' down the cider, uh?  Hey, word to the wise --
       [shows Homer a card] season pass!  It pays for itself after the
       sixteenth visit.  You know, most people don't know the difference
       between apple cider  and apple juice, but I do. Now here's a
       little trick to help you remember.  If it's clear and yella',
       you've got juice there, fella!  If it's tangy and brown, you're

Burns: Oh, there was a terrible scandal.  Lily's family forced her to

       I never heard from her again.  But I prattle on.  Tell me

% Kent Brockman does a news report.

This is Kent Brockman, live from the Aztec theater, where police have
learned that kidnapper Homer Simpson and hostage Larry Burns are inside,
talking loudly.
-- "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Worried Marge and Bart and Lisa watch the news coverage.

Marge: Oh, give yourself up, Homie!
 Bart: No, Dad!  Shoot your way out!
Marge: [grunts at Bart]
        [On TV, Homer barges through some doors in the theater, and is
        shot quite graphically through various parts of the body.]
  All: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!
 Kent: A bloody end for Homer Simpson... is just one of several possible
       outcomes according to our computer simulation.  Now, here's how
       it would look if the police killed him with a barrage of
       baseballs.
 Lisa: We've gotta go down there and help Dad!
        [they walk out]
        [Only heard on TV, Homer is pelted with a barrage of baseballs]
Homer: Ouch!  Oooch!  Eeech!  Ouch!  Oooch!  [whining] Oh, stop it!

% Wiggum, Lou and Eddie prepare to move in for the kill and succeed in
% making noise merely by walking down the sticky, noisy floor of the
% auditorium screening Too Many Grandmas.  Wiggum spots a bag of popcorn
% and eats a little of it.  "Still warm.  They can't be far."  "Chief!"
% calls out Lou, pointing to the exit next to the balcony seat, where
% Homer is found scaling an escape ladder.  The cops run after him,
% making more noisy sounds from running on the sticky floor.

% Homer and Larry run across the Aztec neon sign and see below them the
% swarm of police cars.  A projector is directed towards them.

Wiggum: Don't be a fool, Simpson!  Let the kid go!
 Burns: [through amplifier] The negotiations have failed.  Shoot him!
-- Hostage negociation subliminal tapes at work, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Wiggum takes the safety off the gun and prepares to shoot when Larry
% stands in the way of Homer. He explains everything, much to the stupor
% of the gathering crowd.

   Burns: I should've known you were the only one stupid enough to
          kidnap you!  Now get down here so I can spank you in front of
          this gawking rabble.
          [away from amplifier]  Smithers, take off my belt.
Smithers: [giddily]  With pleasure, sir!
-- Don't give out too much clues, now, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Homer intervenes.

Homer: Maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime?
       All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love.  I'm a
       father myself, sir.  And sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious
       [Bart glares], or boring [Lisa glares], or stinky [Maggie
       glares], but they can always count on one thing: their father's
       unconditional love.

% Homer and Larry are taken down by the crane of a fire truck. Homer
% hugs his wife and kids.

Larry: Well, how 'bout it, Pop?  I know it's tough, but can you love me
       for what I am?  [cops a smirk]
Burns: Uh... well... uh... [hugs Larry]  There there, sonny boy. I
       suppose I have been a bit... Oh, no, I can't do it.  It's just
       not me.  I'm sorry, Larry.  I can't be the family that you need.
Larry: Aw, that's okay.  I got a wife and kids.  Oh, that reminds me.
       They're probably wondering where I went.  I told 'em I'm going
       for coffee.  That was a week ago.
-- "Burns, Baby Burns"

Burns: Well, son, delighted to have met you.  It's good to know that...
       there's another kidney out there for me.
Larry: You got it, Pop.  Just let me run a few pints through it first.
-- "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Larry is given a margarita, and invites everyone to party. The entire
% crowd cheers, and Journey's "Any Way You Want It" starts playing
% loudly as everyone starts dancing while drinking a lot of liquor.

 Lisa: Who's playing that music?
Marge: And where's all that liquor coming from?
Homer: It's a party, Marge.  Doesn't have to make sense.
        [a Hawaiian lei falls from out of the sky onto Homer's neck]
        [Homer's handed a drink]
Homer: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Oh, yeah!
