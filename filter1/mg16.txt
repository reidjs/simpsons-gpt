% Bart and Maggie sit at what appears to be an island in the kitchen.
% Marge (wearing oven mitts) carries a cookie sheet of freshly-baked
% chocolate-chip cookies.

M: Fresh chocolate-chip cookies.

% Bart reaches out towards the tray, but Marge puts it down on the table.
% She raises her finger in warning.

M: Don't touch those yet.  They're very, very hot.

% Marge leaves.  Bart clasps his hands dastardly.

B: Aha!  No one's around.  The perfect crime.

% Bart reaches for a cookie.  As his hand touches the tray, we hear a
% sizzling sound, and Bart's hand turns red.

B: Yow!

% Bart holds up his hand, which throbs in pain.

% Same set-up as before.  The cookies are on the table.
% During Marge's lecture, the kids' eyes glance between her and the cookies.

M: I hope I can trust you two not to eat those yummy chocolate-chip cookies.

% She leaves.

B: Go on, Maggie.  Take a cookie.

% Maggie closes her eyes as she shakes her head `no'.

B: Aw, come on, man.  Don't be a chicken.

% Maggie shakes her head.

B: Well, if you won't commit the perfect crime, I will.

% Just as Bart reaches for a cookie, Marge pokes her head in the door.
% Bart screams and tosses the cookie in the air in surprise.
% Up up up.  Down down down.  Into Maggie's mouth.  (*gulp*)
% She then replaces her pacifier with a smile.  Bart glowers at
% Maggie, then looks skyward trying to appear innocent.
% Marge is next to the counter.

M: Very good, Maggie.  You prevented Bart from making a mess.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:42]
%
% One mo' time.

M: I mean it.  Don't even think about touching those scrumptious cookies.

% Marge leaves.

B: [to Maggie] Who's she gonna believe, huh?

% Bart proceeds to shovel cookies into his mouth.  Maggie watches each
% cookie go in.

B: You?  Or me?

% Another cookie.

B: You can't defend yourself.  You can't even talk.
   I'll blame it all on you.

% Another cookie.

B: The perfect crime!

% Marge opens the door.

M: Bart!

% Bart points an accusing finger at Maggie.  As he talks, cookie crumbs
% spew out of his mouth.

B: It was her, man.  I swear it!

% Marge has reached the counter.

M: [disappointed]  Oh, Bart...

% Bart hangs his head in shame.

% Close-up on Homer, his head tilted back, his eyes closed, and his
% nose enjoying the aroma of freshly-baked cookies.

H: Do I smell cookies?

% We pull back to see Maggie and Marge at their usual places.  Bart is
% missing.  So are all the cookies.

M: [gasp!]
H: Where's the cookies?
M: They're all gone.  The whole batch!
H: [menacingly] Somebody ate those cookies...
M: Did you eat the cookies, Maggie?

% Maggie shakes her head and points vigorously off stage right.

H: I think she's trying to tell us something...

% Maggie pushes her hair up and turns her face into a likeness of Bart.

M: Go on, Maggie.

% As Maggie gets out of her chair, she loses her balance and falls. (*thud*)
% Homer talks as if he's addressing a dog.

H: Go on, Maggie, go, go!

% Maggie walks down the hallway, pointing vigorously as she walks.
% She follows a trail of crumbs... into Bart's room.  Marge and
% Homer follow.  Bart is on his back, groaning, his belly swollen
% from his cookie-fest.  He raises his head.

B: [in pain] There is no perfect crime.

% Bart lowers his head and continues groaning.
%
% Maggie removes her pacifier (*pop*), produces a cookie, and puts
% it into her mouth.  (*munch*)  (*gulp*)  (*smile*)
