% The Springfield Elementary School Bus is looking the worse for wear.
% Its back bumper is loose and its muffler sparks as it drags along the
% ground.  The children on the bus seem to be enjoying the bumpy ride,
% all except for Wendell.

Milhouse: This bus has seen better days.
    Bart: Well, at least it's safer than the old bus.
           [shot of old bus, propped up on blocks]
           [a leaf from a tree falls on it; it explodes]
Milhouse: Uh oh, time to move: the hole's getting bigger.

          through]
    Edna: Seymour, the children are playing in the hole again.
          Shouldn't you get that fixed?
 Skinner: Edna, you _know_ they just cut the school's budget.  If I had
          the money I'd fix the exhaust leak in the back.  Actually, I
          think it's causing some of our low test scores.

% Begin braking procedure!"  The children take off their jackets and
% hold them out the window so they fill with air and provide drag.

% At the fort, a tour guide shows some students a cannon.

Guide: This civil war cannon had been fully restored and is in ready-to-
       fire condition.  But it's a good thing we're _not_ firing it
       because it happens to be aimed at the main support leg of that
       lookout tower.  People don't realize that these cannons are very
       sensitive, and the slightest jolt could set them off.
        [the bus from Springfield Elementary arrives and skids into the
       cannon, knocking one of its wheels off]
       Of course, for safety reasons, we don't keep the cannon loaded:
       it's just common sense.

% Part of the tour features a reenactment of a famous scene from the
% war.

Guide: On May 21, 1864, the men of the Ninth Bearded Infantry were
       sunning and fluffing their beards in the sun.  Suddenly, enemy
       troops crested that hill over there.
Man 1: Fort Springfield, we surrender unconditionally!
Man 2: We're sick.  We need leeches and hacksaws to saw off our
       gangrenous limbs!
Guide: But the Springfield Brigade was too brave to accept the
       surrender.
Man 3: Come on, boys!  Those white flags are no match for our muskets.
        [they charge]
Guide: And the Springfielders heroically slaughtered their enemies as
       they prayed for mercy.

Skinner: All right, children, switch.

  Man 4: Hey, they're trying to learn for free!
  Guide: [sees them] Get 'em!
  Man 3: Use your phony guns as clubs!
Skinner: Run, children!

   Uter: Wait, wait!

   Edna: Well, Seymour, because of your penny-pinching, we're coming
         back from a field trip with the fewest children yet.
Skinner: God bless the man who invented permission slips.

         salaries, supplies, the food -- [takes a bite] -- I don't care
         what you say, I can taste the newspaper.
Skinner: Posh.  Shredded newspapers add much-needed ruffage and
         essential inks.  Besides, you didn't notice the old gym mats.
          [Lunch Lady Doris feeds some into a grinder]
         Doris: There's very little meat in these gym mats.
   Edna: Our demands are very reasonable.  By ignoring them, you're

Skinner: Oh, come on, Edna: we both know these children _have_ no

Skinner: [takes it] It still points, doesn't it?
   Edna: Stop that!  And look at this: the only books we have are ones

   Edna: [scoffs] I'm sure you'd really hate that.  There's not going to
         be a strike, Bart.
   Bart: Yeah...Skinner says you wouldn't have the won tons to go

   Edna: Skinner said _that_?
   Bart: Well, I had to clean it up a little.

         Basically, Krabappel said you'd give the teachers everything

Skinner: She did?

Skinner: We'll see about that.  Simpson, I always thought you were...

% Next day, Marge supervises recess.  Bart hides behind a tree.

   Bart: Psst!  Over here.
  Marge: Huh?
   Bart: Mom, I need a dollar.  Ever since you started teaching here
         kids have been taking my lunch money, and I need that money for
         candy.
  Marge: Mmm, here you go precious.  Now, go off with your friends.
          [pushes him towards Jimbo, Dolph, and Nelson]
  Jimbo: "Here you go, precious."
          [they start beating him up]
   Bart: Why isn't my mom stopping this?
  Jimbo: We created a diversion.
  Marge: That's a very nice jig, Kearney.  Now isn't dancing much more
         fun than bullying?
Kearney: [chuckles] Yeah.

% Bart picks himself up woozily.

    Bart: That's it, I can't take this any more, Milhouse.  I've got to
          get the real teachers back.
Milhouse: Bart, you'll never get Krabappel and Skinner together again.
          They're like two positively charged ions.
    Bart: Zuh?  Wait!  That's it!  With your booksmarts, and my ability
          to exploit people with booksmarts, we can figure out a clever
          plan to get them back together!
           [later]
    Edna: A surprise party for _me_?  In Principal Skinner's office?
          Well, I don't know, but...all right.
 Skinner: Me?  Go to my office?  Well, it's highly irregular, but all
          right.
           [Bart padlocks them into the office]
    Bart: And you're not coming out until you reach an agreement!
-- The clever plan, "The PTA Disbands"

% The two trapped teachers pound on the door, threatening Bart.  "Don't
% worry, they'll start negotiating," says Bart, but as the clock turns
% forward from 11:00 to 3:00, the pounding continues.  It stops briefly
% at 5:00, only to resume.
%
% Eventually, they're too tired to keep pounding.

   Edna: Well, Seymour, I guess we could start talking.
Skinner: What's the point?  There's no more money, unless you've got
         some magic new source of revenue.
   Edna: Well, we've _got_ to think something up.  They've got us locked
         in here like prisoners.
Skinner: Prisoners in our own school...hey!
          [they gasp at one another]
-- A plan begins to form, "The PTA Disbands"

% So they turn the school into Springfield Elementary School and Prison,
% with fences and guard towers.

Skinner: This is a great way to make extra money, renting out our
         cloakrooms to our overcrowded prison system.
  Snake: Yo, I used to sit right over there.
          [the other prisoner snatches a piece of Martin's shirt]
          [he moves his desk quickly away]
   Edna: It's all right, children, just ignore the murderer.
Skinner: And, as a bonus, some of our more troublesome students might be
         scared straight.
  Snake: Psst!  Kid, help me break out of here.  I'll _totally_ make it
         worth your while.
   Bart: [smiling] I'm listening...
-- Or scared crooked, whatever, "The PTA Disbands"
