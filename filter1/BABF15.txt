Vicki: Self-tapping shoes?  I'm ever so pissed!
Lisa:  I'm sorry, Vicki.  I just wanted to be a dancer *so* badly.
Vicki: [sigh] I understand.  We all do crazy things when we're desperate.  I
       once destroyed Buddy Ebson's credit rating.
Lisa:  Why?
Vicki: He knows why.
       [Homer and Marge look at each other]
Frink: [looking at shoes] Jesus, Mary and glavin!  These shoes are in the off
       position!
Lisa:  You mean I danced all by myself?
Marge: See, honey?  All you needed was to believe--
Homer: [taking the shoes] What are you talking about, Professor Frink?
       They're clearly in the on position.  See?  "On".
Frink: I was merely trying to spare he girl's feelings, you insensitive clod.
Homer: Oh -- OH!  Well, now that I look even closer--
Lisa:  Forget it, Dad.  Oh, I guess I'm never gonna be your Broadway baby.
Homer: That's not true, honey. [they all start to walk] You can always write a
       depressing Broadway play of some kind.
Lisa:  You think so?
Marge: Sure, it could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
Homer: Hey, yeah!  You could load it up with lots of swears!  That's what
       David Mamet does.
Lisa:  Oh, I love you guys.
