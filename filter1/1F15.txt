% It's another delicate morning in Springfield, USA.  Marge trudges out
% of bed and walks down the stairs, amidst a minefield of junk the other
% members of the family have left lying around.  "Mmm," she grumbles,
% "Sandwich," stepping on one.  Further down the stairs, she notices
% some underpants draped over the railing.
%
% The kitchen, too, is a disaster area.  Eggs are smashed on the wall;
% pizza drips gooily from the ceiling.  Checking in the fridge, Marge
% finds Homer's bowling ball -- and some more underpants.  Still, she
% prepares breakfast for the family without complaining.
%
% Homer, Lisa, and Bart walk in with a cheery, "Hi Mom!", and tuck into
% the breakfast Marge has kindly prepared.

 Bart: After breakfast, me and Milhouse are going down to the ravine.
       We got a tip from a six-year-old that there's a dead Martian down
       there.
 Lisa: And I'm going to the park to jam with "The Little White Girls
       Blues Quartet."  Wanna come with me, Daddy-O?
Homer: I'd love to, honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer-drinking
       contest today.
 Bart: Think you'll win?
Homer: Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether
       you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.
 Bart: Gotcha.
-- The wisdom of age, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% "Well, gotta go!" says Bart, getting up to leave.  Homer and Lisa do
% the same.  Marge, however, blocks the doorway.

 Bart: Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom.
Homer: [cheery] Push her down, son.

% "No one's going anywhere!"  Marge begins angrily.  "We're going to
% clean the whole house from top to bottom," she says, handing out
% buckets and mops all around.  "Oh dear God, no!" cries Homer, and in a
% panic, Bart runs to the front door and grasps it frantically, trying
% to get out.  Marge warns him that escape is impossible.

    Marge: Now each one of you take a floor and get started.
    Homer: I call the basement!
Bart+Lisa: Fine.
    Homer: [questioningly] D'oh?

% into a swirling vortex.  Paper is strewn everywhere when he shuts it
% down and dusts his hands.

 Homer: All done.
 Marge: You're not done.  I want you to throw away these old calendars
        and TV Guides.
 Homer: Are you mad, woman?  You never know when an old calendar might
        come in handy.  Sure, it's not 1985 now, but who knows what

Marge: Get a rope, Bart?
Homer: Naw, that's OK.  I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out.
       First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out, now I'll pull my
       arms out with my face.
-- Homer at the Springfield tar pits, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Homer begins sinking, and Bart implores Stampy to pull him out with
% his trunk.  Stampy reaches in and finds Barney, who walks away with a,
% "Thanks, Stampy!"  He lights a cigar and catches on fire.

       [Stampy pulls Homer from the tar pit]
Homer: I'm alive.  I'm alive!  And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
 Lisa: Dad, "feline" means "cat".
Homer: Elephant, honey.  It's an elephant!
-- Well, duh, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% "And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano," Homer continues, but Bart and
% Lisa castigate him: "Dad!"

Homer: I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my
       life.  And the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with
       him.
 Bart: Thanks, Dad.
Homer: On the other hand, who's to say what's right these days, what
       with all our modern ideas...and products?
        [Bart and Lisa look angrily at him]
       All right, we'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal
       refuge.
 Kids: Yay!  [hug Homer]
 Bart: Uh, Mom?  We're stuck to Dad.
Marge: Mmm, this is just what happened at the caramel factory.
        [pulls them off]
 Lisa: Ow, my hair!
Homer: Mmm, caramel.
-- We don't want to know, "Bart Gets an Elephant"

% Bart bids a tearful goodbye to Stampy outside the animal refuge.
% Stampy reaches for him and Bart cringes, expecting to be put in his
% mouth once again, but instead Stampy lifts him on his back.  The
% elephant runs into the pasture, spilling Bart off, and starts butting
% another elephant.  "Attaboy, Stampy!  Butt him once for me!"

        [Stampy butts another elephant]
 Marge: Gosh, I thought he'd be happier in his true habitat.
Warden: Oh, I think he is.
 Marge: Then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
Warden: Well, animals are not like people, Mrs. Simpson.  Some of them
        act badly because they've had a hard life, or have been
        mistreated...but, like people, some of them are just jerks.
        Stop that, Mr. Simpson.
         [Homer butts the warden repeatedly]
-- "Jerk" about sums it up, "Bart Gets an Elephant"
