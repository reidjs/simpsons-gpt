% eyeball from "Lard of the Dance", Bart runs from Homer down the stairs from
% "Bart's Friend Falls in Love", Lisa plays her new saxophone from "Lisa's

% children, we see old home movies of what they were like as babies.
% Young Bart puts a water hose in car's gas tank; Marge yanks it out.
% Sometime during the winter, young Lisa walks out on the snow's surface,
% then sinks into it; Marge digs her out.  Finally, Maggie scribbles with
% a marker all over Homer, who is sleeping on the couch; Marge runs over,
% but, indifferent, lets it continue.

Marge: Nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids.  They almost drove me to
       fortified wine.
Homer: Then we figured out we could park them in front of the TV.  That's how
       I was raised, and I turned out TV.
Ned:   [interviewed on his couch] I'd see 'em sitting on that couch all day
       long, just staring at that Hollywood hogwash.
Homer: Our favorite show was "Hollywood Hogwash", but we also loved "The Dreck
       Squad"...
Marge: ..."The Malarkeys", "Dumbin' it Down"...
Lisa:  ..."Sheriff Lowbrow"...
Bart:  ..."Home Improvement"...
Homer: ...but we never saw people like *us* on TV.
Bart:  TV families were always hugging and tackling issues.
Marge: Homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show.  Finally I
       said, "So do it.  Either [bleep] or get off the pot."
Narr.: And [bleep] he did.  Using his home as the studio and his family as the
       cast, this penniless Peckinpah shot a crude five minute video.

Moe:   [interviewed in the bar] Oh, Homer was spending money like a teenage

       when do we start filming?  [looks at camera] ...Oh.
Lenny: [interviewed on the curb outside Moe's alongside Carl] Even Bart was

       up all night paying people to kiss, so Dad volunteered to do the stunt.

       going great at first; I felt like I was king of the world.
Homer: [on tape] I'm king of the world!  Whoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo!
Homer: Right about here I realize something's wrong.  Yup, there I go.
       [rolling down the cliff] Then came the rocks -- jagged rocks, hitting

Narr.: The sequence became an instant comedy classic, but what the audience

          handrails but snaps his other leg.  He collapses to the ground

       Somehow, Homer became addicted to painkillers.  It was the only way he
       could perform the bone-cracking physical comedy that made him a star.

Narr.:   As the Simpsons' money dwindled, their expenses soared.  From the

Wiggum:  [interviewed outside his police car] I'd never acted before in my

         I've even got a catch phrase -- N'yeah!  Wah!  Wah-wah-wah!  No, I
         lost it.
Narr.:   Then, another bombshell: an anonymous tipster alerted Uncle Sam that
         the Simpsons were evading their income taxes.
Apu:     [interviewed in a shadow in the Kwik-E-Mart] Yes, I finked on Homer,
         but, you know, he deserved it.  Never have I seen such abuse of the

Narr.: Desperate to polish their tarnished image, the family agreed to a live

     Marge:  Swings!
     Homer:  Rocks!
     Girls:  Swings!

Narr.: The Simpsons' TV show started out on a wing and a prayer, but now the
       wing was on fire, and the prayer had been answered ... by Satan.  After
       the state fair fiasco, none of the family were speaking to each other.
       Fox put the show on hiatus and replaced it with hidden camera footage
       from the dressing room at Ann Taylor.
Homer: That slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing.  It gave us a
       chance to pursue solo projects.  I returned to my first love: the
       legitimate theater.

     Lisa: To prolong the run of the series, I was secretly given antigrowth

-- Lisa's solo project, "Behind the Laughter"

% Needless to say, the book does nothing to mend the growing divisions
