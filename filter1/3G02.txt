        Homer: Guessing how much Elvis weighed,
Homer & Marge: Those were the days!

% Applause, and fade out.  Of course, don't forget the usual reminder, 
% provided by a voice-over, that "The Simpsons" is filmed before a live
% studio audience.

% In the living room, Bart sits on the couch, watching TV.  Homer comes
% in from the kitchen, drinking a can of beer.

Homer: Hey there, meathead, what are you watching?
 Bart: Aw, I thought I'd check out the Warner Brothers Network.
       [On the TV, an singing and dancing amphibian similar to "Michigan
       J. Frog" appears on screen, in front of a logo similar to the "WB"

 Frog: [singing] We're proud to present on the WB, another bad show that no 
       one will see! [disgustedly walking off] Ah, I need a drink.
-- Watching TV, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Said show that no one will see, except for Bart and Homer, is about
% Krusty the clown.

It's the TV movie of the year!  "The Krusty the Clown Story: Booze, Drugs,
Guns, Lies, Blackmail, and Laughter!"  Starring Fyvush Finkel as Krusty
the Clown!
-- Fun for the whole family! TV announcer, ``Lisa's Sax''

% In the movie, "Krusty" sits among a circle of clowns at the Betty Ford
% Center in the "Clown Detox Wing", baring his soul.

I went through a five-year orgy of non-stop pills, and booze, with
nothing to show for it but four Emmys and a Peabody Award! [groans]
-- Krusty the clown played by Fyvush Finkel, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Back at home with the Simpsons, Bart seems to actually like the movie.

All right!  They're going to show his disastrous marriage to Mia Farrow!
-- Bart, on Krusty, ``Lisa's Sax''

% They sure do; "Krusty" is standing in his living room in a sea of kids.

 Fyvush: Chan Ho, your mother Mia and I are getting a divorce.
Chin Ho: Chan Ho is over there!  I am Chin Ho!
 Fyvush: Whoever you are!  Just pass it along, kid!

[watching the show] Heh, heh, heh, heh!  What a bad father!
[As if on cue, Maggie walks by with a power drill in her arms, falling
onto the floor from the weight. Homer ignores this.]
-- Homer, All-American father, ``Lisa's Sax''

% From the top floor comes a familiar baritone groan; it's Lisa, practicing
% on her saxophone.

Lisa!  Knock off that racket!
-- I can't hear the bad father on TV. Homer, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Lisa calls back from the top of the stairs, holding her instrument.

 Lisa: But Dad, I'm supposed to practice an hour a day!
Homer: I'll practice you!
 Lisa: You'll practice me...what does that mean?  Is it supposed to be some
       sort of a threat?
-- Kids are getting smarter, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Lisa walks back to her room and continues wailing.  Homer growls in
% frustration. Homer asks Bart to make her stop.
% Bart murmurs in assent, and confronts Lisa, who is sitting on her bed.

Lisa: Look Bart, I have to practice my saxophone, and you can't stop me!
Bart: Oh yeah?  My dear Lisa, you are eight, and I am ten.  And in my two
      extra years on this planet, I've learned a few tricks.
      [Bart thinks for a moment, deciding which trick to use.  He opts for
      the traditional means.]
Bart: Gimmie that sax!
Lisa: No!
Bart: I said gimmie it!
Lisa: I said NO!
Bart: Gimmie it!
Lisa: No!
-- Kids, don't try this at home, ``Lisa's Sax''


% After this goes on for a while, Bart yanks the sax from her hands, and 
% Lisa watches in slow-mo terror as it flies out her window, into the
% street. It lands with a clatter, and is immediately crushed by car, a
% truck driven by Hans Moleman, and a few jumps from Nelson, accompanied
% by the usual "Ha, ha!".  Not to mention the tricycle-riding man from
% Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In falling onto it.  Back inside, Lisa holds her
% beloved instrument on the family room couch, sobbing.

Homer: Aw, Lisa, it doesn't look so bad.
 Lisa: Oh yeah?
       [She turns the saxophone so both we and Homer can see that it's
       been rendered perfectly flat.]
-- ``Lisa's Sax''

Homer: Ew!  Lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better I'll destroy
       something Bart loves.
 Bart: Hey!
Homer: Don't worry, son, if that bothers you, I'll destroy something
       Maggie loves!
       [At this, Maggie looks at Homer and clutches the power drill she's
       holding tighter.]
-- That way everyone's happy, ``Lisa's Sax''

 Lisa: Dad, you don't understand.  This saxophone is like my oldest friend.
       I've had it for as long as I can remember.
Homer: You don't remember how you got it?
 Lisa: [dejected] Nuh-uh.
Homer: Oh, well!  It all happened in 1990!  Back then, "The Artist Formerly
       Known As Prince" was currently known as "Prince".  Tracey Ullman was
       entertaining America with songs, sketches, and crudely drawn filler
       material.  And Bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school.
-- Thank God this isn't a clip show, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Flashback, accompanied by the song "Don't Worry, Be Happy".  Bart,
% lunchbox in hand, stands at the front door as Marge gets him ready to be
% sent off to school.  Baby Lisa sits on the floor nearby, playing with
% letter blocks.  She stacks them to make the word "STAR". She tries to
% show Marge, but Marge says she's busy getting Bart ready.
% With a frustrated "hmph!" Lisa knocks the blocks over with a smack.  They
% form the word "RATS" on the floor.


Homer: Now son, on your first day of school, I'd like to pass on the words
       of advice my father gave me.
       [Homer remembers his own first day, where Abraham was kneeling down
       to have a talk with him.]
  Abe: Homer, you're dumb as a mule and twice as ugly!  If a strange man
       offers you a ride, I say, take it!
       [Homer re-awakens from his mind wanderings.]
Homer: Lousy traumatic childhood!

-- Reminiscing time, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Outside, a horn beeps.

Marge: Ooh, there's the bus!  Goodbye sweetheart! [she hugs him]
 Bart: [happily] School will be fun!
-- If only, ``Lisa's Sax''

% In the school auditorium, Bart's new Principal gives his opening 
% remarks to the new class of students.

Welcome kindergarteners, I'm Principal Sinner...Skinner!
[The crowd of kids laugh.]
Well, that's it.  I've lost them forever.
-- Class after class of ugly, ugly children, ``Lisa's Sax''

Skinner: Now I'd like to introduce you to Lunch Lady Doris, who'll serve you
         healthy, nutrious meals.
  Doris: Yeah, right.
Skinner: Ms. Phipps, the school nurse, who will provide ointments
         and unguents, and Jimbo, the school bully, who will administer
         noogies and nipple twisters.
  Jimbo: I look forward to wailing on all of you.
-- First impressions, ``Lisa's Sax''

% The kids gulp.  In Bart's class, he and his new schoolmates sit in a
% circle, singing "And Bingo Was His Name-O".  We watch as Bart does a solo.

  Class: [singing] There was a farmer, had a dog, and Bingo was his name-O!
   Bart: B-I-(clap)-(clap)-O!  B-I-(clap)-(clap)-O!  
         B-I-(clap)-(clap)-(clap)!  And Bingo was his name-O!
Teacher: [observing with clipboard] Added extra clap; not college material.
-- Bart's inner child, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Later that day, Bart skips through the grass, humming happily.
% Groundskeeper Willie stops him and yells, through a thick Scottish
% accent, undecipherable exclamations at the boy.  Bart looks at him
% blankly. He points to a sign, which reads "Ach! Keep off the grass!".
% Bart sees the sign and walks melancholically away.  Back at home, Bart
% comes home and walks silently inside the front door.  Marge calls to
% him. Marge cheerfully asks how his day was.
% His lunchbox in one hand and his blanket in the other, Bart walks up
% the stairs without answering.  Back in the present, Homer and Marge

-- Sing-song, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Bart and Lisa clap on the couch, though Lisa's was really more of a "golf
% clap", as she's about to point out that something got neglected.

Homer: And that my children, is the story of Bart's first day of school.
 Bart: [relaxing back on couch] Very nice.
Homer: Yeah.
 Lisa: Yeah.  Except you were supposed to be telling the story of how I

[End of act one.  Time: 6:58.]

% Act two.  Marge comes into the family room holding Maggie.

Marge: Homer, I can't get the baby to burp.  Could you try it for a while?
Homer: No problem.  I'll just give her a sip of beer!
-- What a great father, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Homer tries to get Maggie to take a drink, which she wants nothing to 
% do with.

 Homer: Come on, Maggie, it's Miller time!  [baby talk] Yes, it's Miller

 Marge: Homer!
 Homer: Oh, my father gave me beer as a child.  'Til I wrapped my little
        red wagon around a tree.

 Lisa: Mom, can you tell me a story about how I got my saxophone and not
       have it turn into a story about Bart?!
Marge: Well sure, honey.  Bart had just completed his first day of school,
       and Bart...
 Lisa: Mom!
 Bart: Hey, she's just giving the public what it wants: Bart by the 
       barrelfull!
-- Well.. it WAS 1990, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Marge resumes the story after explaining that it just goes like that.
% Back in 1990, Bart is reciting the alphabet for his kindergarten teacher.

   Bart: A-B-C...uh, line?
Teacher: D!
   Bart: D-E...mmm, line?
Teacher: F, Bart.  And believe me, you'll be seeing plenty of 'em.
-- Early disencouragement, ``Lisa's Sax''

% At home, Bart lies on his bed, depressed. Marge comes in asking if
% Bart would like to read a book, or draw. Bart says he already did.
% He points to the wall, where a picture he drew hangs.  It shows Bart,
% lying on the ground, with knives stuck in him, thunderclouds overhead,
% and the word "SAD" written across the page.  Marge reacts in surprise.  
% Meanwhile, downstairs, Homer has all the lights turned out as he watches
% television.  From the TV, a certain rather strange program bathes the
% room in blue light, casting shadows all about.

TV Voice: That's damn fine coffee you got here in Twin Peaks!  And damn
          good cherry pie!
          [On the screen, a man dances with a horse under a tree, from
          which a stop light hangs.  They dance to the saxophone music being

   Homer: Brilliant! [laughs] I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
-- Neither do we, ``Lisa's Sax''

Marge: Homer, I want you to look at this drawing Bart did!
Homer: [faking excitement, watching TV] Oh, it's beautiful!  Oh, oh, let's
       put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!
Marge: Homer, stop.  Will you please look at the drawing?
Homer: Oh, all right.  What...[looks at drawing]...aaah!!  Burn it!  Send
       it to hell!
Marge: I think we're going to have to get Bart some help.
Homer: [cringing] Get it away!
-- The horrible reality, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Later, Homer comes into Bart's room with a cap, ball, and glove.  Bart
% lies on his bed, motionless.

Homer: Bart, son?  You want to play catch?
 Bart: No.
Homer: When a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is
       seriously wrong!
  Abe: [wearing old-time baseball uniform] I'll play catch with you, son!
Homer: Get the hell out!
  Abe: I'm gone.
-- Like father, like son, ``Lisa's Sax''

% In Doctor Hibbert's office, Hibbert, who wears an outfit not unlike that
% of Mr. T, gives Bart a check-up.

Mr. Simpson, physically your son is as sound as the dollar!  I'm afraid
Bart's severe emotional dysfunction stems from a deep-seated psychological
trauma. [laughs]
-- I pity da poor boy, ``Lisa's Sax''

% With nowhere else to turn, as Marge narrates to us, the Simpsons go to
% see the school psychologist.

Dr. Pryor: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, there's nothing to be alarmed about.  
           Public school can be intimidating to a young child,
           particularly one with as many flamboyantly homosexual
           tendencies as your son.
    Marge: Bart's gay?
Dr. Pryor: Bart?  Ah, whoo, wrong file.
           [Dr. Pryor puts a file reading "VANHOUTEN, MILHOUSE" back onto
           the rack.]
-- He thinks I'm gay? (everybody dance now!) ``Lisa's Sax''


Ah, the point I'm trying to make here is, that Bart must learn to be less
of an individual, and more a...faceless slug.
-- Top notch advice. Dr. Pryor, ``Lisa's Sax''

% With this, he looks down to see Lisa, on Marge's lap, who is busy 
% piecing together a jigsaw puzzle, depicting the Taj Mahal, on Dr. Pryor's 
% desk.

Dr. Pryor: Hm, Lisa, how old are you?
     Lisa: I am three and three eighths!
Dr. Pryor: Hm!  Lisa, if I have five apples, and I take away three apples,
           how many apples do I have left?
     Lisa: Two apples!
    Homer: Wait a minute! [counts on fingers] She's right!
-- Great Scott! ``Lisa's Sax''

Dr. Pryor: Heh, very good.  Marge, Homer, I believe your Lisa may be gifted.
    Marge: That's wonderful!  But still, can't you do anything for Bart?
    Homer: Marge, he's five, his life is over.  Lisa's the wave of
           the future!
     Lisa: Wave of the future!
Dr. Pryor: Uh huh, that's right, honey.  If you nurture her gift now, 
           there's no telling what she can do.
    Homer: Wow...just think of the possibilities!
           [In dreamland, Homer imagines Lisa winning the Nobel Prize.
    Homer: Nah!

           it to her.]
    Homer: Hmm!

% Dr. Pryor promises them the address of a good preschool.
% At a nearby highly prestigeous-looking preschool, we see kids using 
% computers, painting, and playing a clapping game while reciting the

% nearby, crafting a horse out of clay.

Headmaster: I can assure you our preschool is of the highest quality.  Over
            seventy-five percent of our graduates go on to first grade!
     Homer: Well, our little girl has a gift, and we're willing to do what
            it takes to help her.
Headmaster: Very good.  Once we receive your six thousand dollar tuition 
            check, she's in.
     Homer: I'll give you fifty bucks.
Headmaster: Our fee is non-negotiable.
     Homer: Seventy-five!
     Marge: Look, I knew private school would be expensive, but I was hoping
            we could get a scholarship of some sort.
Headmaster: Sorry.  I don't have anything to offer you unless you're a
            member of a minority group.
     Homer: [Mexican accent] Excellente!  Muchos gracias seniorata!
Headmaster: Sorry.

-- The man of many faces, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Marge and Homer leave the preschool, taking Lisa with them.
% ``Come on, honey, I guess this is a world you'll never know.''
% Sad music accompanies our journey back into the present, where Homer
% continues to narrate the story.

Homer: Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever.  Bart was
       miserable at school, and Lisa's gifts were going to waste.
 Bart: Uh, Homer?  It's five years later, and I'm still miserable at 
       school.
 Lisa: And my gifts are still going to waste!
Marge: And sometimes I feel so smothered by this family I just want to 
       scream until my lungs explode!!
       [The rest of the family stares at Marge for a moment.  She regains
       her composure after a deep breath.]
Marge: I'll go start dinner now. [leaves for kitchen]
Homer: You do that.
-- Getting some jitters out of the system, ``Lisa's Sax''

[End of act two.  Time: 12:19.]

% Act three.  Grandpa Simpson has come over for a visit.

Homer: Dad, what are you doing here?
  Abe: Looking for my teeth!
       [Santa's Little Helper has the false teeth in place in his mouth.]
  Abe: Gimmie those! [takes teeth] Better wash these off.  Aw, the hell with
       it. [puts teeth in mouth, dog drool and all]
-- Ewwww, ``Lisa's Sax''

Marge: Well, Grandpa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that

Brockman: And so Springfield's heat wave continues, with today's temperature
          exceeding the record for this date, set way back four billion 
          years ago, when the earth was just a ball of molten lava!
   Homer: Oh...so hot...
   Marge: Homer, have you seen the frozen peas?

          peas out from underneath him.]
   Marge: Ahh, you keep 'em.
-- The heatwave, ``Lisa's Sax''

Marge: Now listen, if we can't afford private school, maybe there's some
       other way to encourage Lisa.  Eh, an art class! Ballet lessons!
       They have some fun things you can do at the museum on Saturday!
Homer: Uh-uh.  Forget it, Marge.  There is no way I am spending my
       Saturdays at a museum.  Unless...museums don't have foosball, do

      Moe: Eh, that's a parasol.
-- Decorative, yet useful, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Homer takes Lisa out of Moe's, and arrives at "It Blows", the air
% conditioning store.  He takes a look at a model of A/C, and takes joy in
% the $200 price tag.  So much joy, in fact, he imagines sitting in the cool
% air it would provide, while Patty and Selma melt in the summer heat outside.
% Looking across the street, however, he sees Lisa gazing in the window of
% King Toots.  He goes over to collect her, when he notices what the store
% sells.

Musical instrument?  Could that be a way to encourage a gifted child?
[to the heavens] Just give me a sign! [At that moment, the store owner
happens to put a sign in the window reading "Musical Instruments: The Way
To Encourage A Gifted Child".] Eh, it works for me.
-- Coulda been a lightning bolt to the butt. Homer, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Inside the store, Homer and Lisa pursue their options.

Homer: So, what do you like, Lisa?  Vio-ma-lin?  Tuba-ma-ba?  Oboe-mo-boe?
 Lisa: [pointing] That one!
       [Lisa's adorable little digit points up to a beautiful new baritone
       sax.]
Homer: Oh...saxo-ma-phone. [reads price tag] Two hundred dollars?!
-- Expensi-ma-ve, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Homer's dream of an air conditioned summer go up in smoke.
% Homer decides to buy the instrument for Lisa.
% Homer hands Lisa the sax, who blows once on the horn and giggles.

Store Owner: Would you like an inscription, sir?
      Homer: Yeah.  To Lisa: never forget your daddy loves...[drops sax 
             on foot]...d'oh!
-- So it's settled, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Back to the Simpson house in the present. Homer says the inscription
% is still here today.
% Sure enough, it is: "To Lisa: Never Forget Your Daddy Loves D'oh!"

 Bart: Wow, so that's how Lisa got her sax!
Homer: Next, I'll tell you the origin of Maggie's pacifier!
Marge: What origin?  We got it for $1.95 down at the Safeway!
-- That was a reeeaal nice legend, Midge, ``Lisa's Sax''

 Lisa: Well, I really liked that story.  But it still doesn't fix this.
Marge: You know, Homer, I think we have some money in the air conditioner
       account again, hmm?
Homer: Oh, but Marge!  Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating 
       like a pig?
 Bart: Yeah, not to mention lookin' like a pig, eatin' like a pig...
  Apu: [from front window] Don't forget the smell!
Homer: Will you get off my front lawn?
  Apu: Why don't you make me?
Homer: Why?  Oh, I give up.
-- A typical few seconds at the Simpsons home, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Lisa tries to kid herself and family into the fact that it's not how
% it looks, it's how it sounds. (Yeah yeah, that's what they said about
% Danny Baker --hmw) She blows on the saxophone, and it, unfortunately,
% squeals like a pig.  She moans in defeat.  Later, Homer sits, watching
% TV during a new heat wave.

Well sir, we got a scorcher today!  And to cool off, nothing beats
Fruitopia!  The iced tea brewed by hippies, but distributed by a heartless,
multi-national corporation!
-- Very heartwarming. TV announcer, ``Lisa's Sax''

% In Lisa's room, she admires her new saxophone, complete with a new
% inscription.
% "Dear Lisa: May Your New Saxophone Bring You Years Of D'oh!".

% Lisa plays the theme from Gerry Rafferty's "Baker Street"; as 'other
% instruments' join in, we watch scenes from previous episodes where Lisa 
% played her sax before, including "Lisa's Pony", "Another Simpsons Clip 
% Show", "Moaning Lisa", and "Separate Vocations".  Back in the Simpson 
% household, Marge and Homer sit on the couch.

Marge: You're a good father.
Homer: I learned from the master.
       [He means Abraham, who sits playing "peek-a-boo" with Maggie,
       sitting on his lap.]
  Abe: Where's Maggie?  Where's Maggie?  I'm not kiddin', I can't see, my
       retinas have detached again!
-- Awww, baby talk, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Homer and Marge laugh loudly.  Apu walks in from the kitchen, holding a 
% sandwich.  He joins them in the merriment.  "He is blind as a bat!" Apu 
% remarks, as Abe stumbles around the family room.

% Fade out to the tune of the Simpson theme, played on saxophone.  Over
% the credits, we hear a lively, jazzy version of the same theme.
