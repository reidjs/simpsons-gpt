% First segment title: "The Thing and I"
%
% The night has fallen upon Springfield, and everything is quiet.
% However, Bart and Lisa are awakened by strange moaning and rattling
% sounds.

Lisa: Did you hear that, Bart?
Bart: Maybe it was just the cat.
Lisa: No, she's sleeping with me.
       [Snowball II shows up, wearing a baby bonnet and booties]
-- Like child like cat, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% It appears the sounds originate from the attic. The next morning,
% during breakfast, Bart asks Homer about it.

 Bart: Did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last
       night?
Homer: Attic? Oh, that's silly.  [laughs]  Seriously though, don't ever
       go up there.
-- What a frank attitude, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Marge: Homer, isn't it about time for the... you know?
Homer: Yeah, yeah, I'll go feed it.
       [goes to the fridge, where he picks up a bucket of fish heads]
       [singing] Fish heads, fish heads, doo doo doo doo doo...
-- Nothing suspicious there, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Homer whistles all the way to the attic, followed by Bart and Lisa.
% They can't see what's going on in there, but the sound of animal
% munching they hear is nothing to reassure them.
%
% The following night, Bart not only hears, but also sees something
% crawling in the air ducts. Come morning, the kids ask to be told the
% truth.

 Lisa: What's up there?
 Bart: Is it a monster?
 Lisa: We have to know.
 Bart: Tell us what's the secret.
Homer: No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and
       all you do is...  [Marge is staring at him]  What?
Marge: *Three*. We have _three_ kids, Homer.
Homer: Yeah, three _nosy_ kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids
       who ask too many questions?
 Kids: [quickly]  No, what? Does something happen? Does something happen
       to nosy kids who ask questions? What happens?
-- Never mind, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Since they cannot get any explanation from their parents, Bart and
% Lisa decide to investigate the matter. After Homer and Marge go out
% for a moment, they form a human ladder with Maggie, who opens the
% attic's door.
%
% Slowly and carefully, they step into the attic, where dozens of
% useless items are stacked up, collecting dust. Among them, Bart
% discovers the unsold copies of Homer's autobiography, "Homer, I Hardly
% Knew Me". Lisa quickly directs his attention to a pair of restricting
% chains, from which something has just escaped. The creature emerges in
% the shadows and jumps right before the kids, causing them to run in
% fear.

       [view of 3 vases, matching the kids' height]
Lisa: [muffled]  Bart, do you think it's safe?
Bart: [muffled]  I don't care -- I can't breathe in here!
       [the kids rush out of a nearby closet, gasping for air]
-- They still remember Tracey Ullman, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% At that moment, Homer and Marge come back into the house.

See, Marge, who needs a car-wash when you can just drive around in the
rain?
-- Homer, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Bart+Lisa: [quickly]  Mom! Dad! We saw something in the attic! We saw
           something in the attic!
    Marge: You went into the attic?  [gasps]  I'm very disappointed and
           terrified.
-- Thanks for calming my fears, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Armed with an iron club, Homer pokes his head into the attic, and
% witnesses that "it" has escaped, leaving behind his chains and a dish
% full of bones. The whole family gasps in horror when they hear rapid
% footsteps and see the front door wide open.
%
% Marge doesn't waste any time and picks up the phone.

Marge: Yes, doctor. It's what we've always feared: it's loose. Hugo is
       loose. See you soon!
-- Casual phonecalls, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Of course, Bart and Lisa overheard.

 Bart: Who or what is Hugo?
Marge: Hmm. I'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, Bart.
       You see... you have a brother.
 Lisa: So I have _two_ brothers?
Homer: Lisa, please.  [pushes her aside]
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Homer explains that Bart has in fact a twin brother: "When you were
% born, there was an irregularity."  "A monstrous irregularity" adds Dr.
% Hibbert, coming out of nowhere, much to Marge stupor.

Hibbert: Yes, I remember Bart's birth well. You don't forget a thing
         like... [dramatic] Siamese twins!
   Lisa: I believe they prefer to be called "conjoined twins".
Hibbert: And Hillbillies prefer to be called "sons of the soil". But it
         ain't gonna happen.
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Dr. Hibbert narrates the birth of Bart and Hugo. It seems that one of
% them was pure evil.

        [Hibbert shows Bart-Hugo to Marge]
        [one of them starts gnawing the other ferociously]
Marge: I think I'll bottle-feed that one.
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Hibbert: The routine soul smear confirmed the presence of pure evil. It
         was then I knew the only option was to separate you two
         immediately.  [chops a paper cutter]
         [hands forms to Marge and Homer]  You'll both need to sign
         these.  [chuckles]
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Hibbert: But what to do with poor Hugo? Too crazy for Boys Town, too
         much of a boy for Crazy Town. The child was an outcast. So, we
         did the only humane thing.
  Homer: We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a
         bucket of fish heads once a week.
  Marge: It's saved our marriage.
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% But Bart remains sceptic: "You expect me to believe all this? If any
% of it was true, wouldn't I have a big hideous scar right --". Indeed,
% the scar is there.
%
% The family starts looking for Hugo.

Homer: We'll search out every place a sick twisted solitary misfit might
       run to.
 Lisa: I'll start with Radio Shack.
-- Hey, I used to hang out there!, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game.
-- Homer, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Bart locks every door and window, until he hears rustling from inside
% the house. "You're here, aren't you?" he realizes. His twin brother
% comes out of the shadows, holding a glass and a plate of fish heads:
% "Yes, Bart, I never left you." Bart inquires about what Hugo might
% want from him. "You'll see, Hugo replies, after the surgery."
%
% So here is Bart, tied up in the attic.

Hugo: I went mad after they tore us apart, but I'll be sane... once I
      sew us back together.
Bart: But you'll *kill* both of us.
Hugo: No, it's easy. Look, I've been practicing: I made a pigeon-rat.
       [said pigeon-rat flies into a wall, falls back, and tries to
       enter a mouse hole]
-- Natural evolution, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Well, let's get started: you want to be on the right or the left?
-- Hugo, about to sew himself to Bart, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Fortunately for Bart, Dr. Hibbert shows up right on time.

Hibbert: There, there, Hugo. I understand. All those years caged up in
         here, why, you've probably never ever seen your own face in the
         mirror, have you? Here.
          [Hibbert hands up a frame between him and Hugo]
   Hugo: Mmm?  [stares into the frame, which reveals Hibbert's face]
          [Hibbert punches him through the (empty) frame]
-- No need for violence, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Homer and Marge step in.

We think we saw Hugo at the airport; he was boarding a plane to
Switzerland and...  [sees Hugo]  Oh.
-- Homer, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Marge unties Bart while Hibbert and Homer take care of Hugo.

Hibbert: You know, isn't it interesting how the left -- or sinister --
         twin is invariably the evil one. I had this theory that... Wait
         a minute. Hugo's scar is on the wrong side. He couldn't have
         been the evil left twin. That means the evil twin is, and
         always has been... Bart!
   Bart: Oh, don't look so shocked.
Hibbert: Well, chalk this one up to carelessness on my part.
-- Pobody's Nerfect, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Nevertheless, Hibbert thinks "there's a way to set everything right".
%
% Later that day, everybody -- with Hugo in lieu of Bart -- is gathered
% around the table for a nice family dinner.

Hibbert: Care for a drumstick, Hugo?
          [Hugo noisily eats his drumstick in 3 seconds, wipes his
          mouth, then starts eating the napkin]
   Lisa: Mom, Hugo's eating his napkin.
          [laughter]
   Bart: [from the air ducts]  Hey, can I have some turkey?
  Marge: No, you finish your fish heads. Then we'll talk.  [closes the
         vent]

% Segment two title: "The Genesis Tub"
%
% In front of her mirror, Lisa looks at the newest gap in her dentition.

Lisa: This tooth will be perfect for my science project.
       [sets up her exhibit: "Will cola dissolve a tooth?"]
      Science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and
      chinese food, but I can still ruin soft drinks for everyone!
-- A lifetime mission, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Bart: Hey, Lis. Check out _my_ science project.  [rubs a balloon over
      his head, then touches Lisa with a spark of static electricity]
Lisa: Ow! What's _that's_ supposed to prove?
Bart: That nerds conduct electricity.  [touches her again]
Lisa: Ow!
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Bart runs away laughing, and Lisa gets back to her exhibit. When she
% touches her tooth, now soaking in cola, she gets a shock again.
% "Stupid Bart" she grumbles, not making much a case of it.
%
% Throughout the night, Lisa sleeps deeply, while the tooth and the cola
% seem to undergo some sort of strange electrical reaction. Come
% morning, Lisa wakes up and looks at her experiment.

Oh boy, mold! That's science fair pay dirt.
-- I can't hold my excitement, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% She brings the tub under her microscope for further analysis. "Looks
% about the same" she complains, until she notices the microscope is set
% for 1x magnification. She brings it to 10x, then 100x, to find
% something shocking: miniature prehistoric human lifeform.

 Lisa: [gasps]  Tiny little people! My God! I've created life!
Marge: Lisa! Breakfast! We're having waffles!
 Lisa: Ooh! Waffles!  [runs down]
-- The meal of choice of Darwin, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% She gets disappointed once she reaches her seat, as the promised
% waffles are "just square pancakes", the waffle iron being in the shop.
% "The waffle iron's been in the shop forever" she grumbles back to her
% room.
%
% Taking another look at her microscope, she is stunned to observe that
% her "little stone age tub dwellers" have already evolved into the
% Renaissance.

Wait, one of them is nailing something to the door of the cathedral.
[gasps]  I've created Lutherans!
-- Lisa, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% During the night, light emerges from the tub, lighting up the whole
% room. The following day, the tub has already evolved well beyond our
% own world. Lisa marvels to this sight of our own possible future.
%
% Bart steps in and inquires about her project; when he sees what seems
% like a model city, he squashes some bits of it ("Oops, my finger
% slipped"), and runs away laughing. Looking back at her microscope,
% Lisa witnesses the damage he's caused.
%
% The following night, a squadron of spaceships launch from the tub and
% proceed to attack Bart for a short time before they come back to their
% base. Bearing many bumps on the face, the boy bursts into Lisa's room,
% ready to strike back. Lisa stops him in time.

Bart: Your micro-jerks attacked me!
Lisa: Well, you practically destroyed their whole world.
Bart: You can't protect them every second. Sooner or later, you'll let
      your guard down, and then flush: it's toilet time for Tinytown.
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Bart leaves, and Lisa sits next to the tub, expressing a long sigh.
% Her attention is suddenly caught by a whirring sound from the tub,
% followed by some sort of energy which surrounds her, shrinking her and
% bringing her into the tub. She is dropped on a tooth-shaped seat, in
% front of an audience which seems to comprise every man and woman in
% this world.
%
% A Frink-like man rejoices.

It worked! The de-bigulator world!
-- Tiny Frink, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% The audience hails her, and what seems to be a spiritual leader greets
% her.

Leader: Welcome to our world, most gracious Lisa.
  Lisa: Your world is incredible. _And_ you speak English.
Leader: We have listened to you speak since the dawn of time, O Creator.
        And we have learned to imatoot you exarktly.
-- Close enough, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% The audience bows, revealing a statue of Lisa. She then realizes that
% she is granted the status of godhood, as she is the one who created
% this world. In that aspect, those people are counting on her to save
% them from the devil, ie. Bart.
%
% When she announces that the devil is her brother, murmurs emerge from
% the audience. Gradually, people come forward with the usual boring
% theological questions (why does a good god allow bad things).

 Lisa: Listen, I can take care of everything. All you have to do is
       unshrink me.
Frink: Unshrink you? Well, that would require some sort of a
       *re*-bigulator, which is a concept so ridiculous is makes me want
       to laugh out loud and chortle, and...  [Lisa looks at him]  uh...
       but not at you, O holiest of gods, with the wrathfulness and the
       vengeance and the blood rain and the hey-hey-hey-it-hurts-me...
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% His words are quickly covered by screams from the audience, as the
% grinning face of Bart appears in the sky. He closes the tub, which is
% later opened by... Principal Skinner.

First-rate work, Bart. This universe you've created is even more
impressive than Martin's milk-carton ukulele.
-- Principal Skinner, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Skinner nominates Bart as winner, and instructs Willy to throw out the
% other projects. Children moan.

Principal Skinner, wait! *I* created the universe! Give _me_ the gift
certificate!
-- Lisa, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Lisa: Oh, great. I'm stuck in this lousy tub for the rest of my life.
       [people stare at her]

-- And what a passionating subject, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Kodos explains that they're on a mission of conquest, and need to

 Kang: President Clin-Ton? Excellent.
Homer: Except, um... there's this election next week, so after that, it
       might not be him anymore. It might be what's-his-name, uh...

% Dole and Clinton are stripped bare naked (urgh!) and pushed into some

What the hell is this, some kind of tube?
-- Bob Dole, in some kind of tube, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

% Dole's tube quickly fills up with some sort of fluid which stops his

%
% The aliens link themselves to the tubes, and initiate a
