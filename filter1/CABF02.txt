Homer:	No one told me the plant was closed.
Carl:	Didn't you get the email?
Homer:	What's an email?
Lenny:	It's a computer thing, like an electric letter ...
Carl:	... or a quiet phone call.
Homer:	I don't have a computer.
Lenny:	Heh, heh, too bad, that's why you're at work, and we're 
living it up on our day off!
Lenny:	Hey Carl, turn up the car radio!
Carl:	Why not!  Anything goes today.  [they drive off]

		expensive paperweight.
Homer:		Well, a paperweight would be nice, but what I really 
		need is a computer.  How about that one?  [points to 
		a second machine]
Salesman:	That technology is three months old.  Only suckers 
		buy out-of-date machines.  You're not a sucker, are 
		you sir?
Homer:		Heavens no!
Salesman:	Oh good, because if you were, I'd have to ask you to 
		leave the store.
Homer:		I just need something to receive email.
Salesman:	[whistles] You'll need a top-of-the-line machine for

		That's the same computer astronauts use to do their
