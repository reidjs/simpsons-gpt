%
% Marge finds a book even Homer might like -- the Duff Book of World

% giggles at the pictures of record-breaking deformities.

Bart:	Why would Duff Beer put out a book?
Lisa:	It was originally published to settle arguments in 
	taverns.
Homer:	She said, "tavern!"  I'm going to Moe's.  [runs out]
Marge:	[calls after him] I never agreed to that rule!

Carl:	All right -- outside.

		longest anyone's ever done this?  [jumps around, 
		making goofy faces and noises]
Record Lady:	Three years.
Homer:		Fine.  I'll just play the banjo with this cobra.  
		[begins doing so, then hits a wrong note] Wait, 
		wait, wait!
Record Man:	[interrupting] Uh, technically the cobra would get 
		the record.  He's the one playing.

Record Lady:	Mr. Simpson, there are thousands of people like you 
		with no discernable talent.
Homer:		Yeah, they're called Congress.  [laughs]
Record Lady:	Shut up.
Homer:		Okay.
Record Man:	All the original records were set by crackpots who 
		half-killed themselves.  The only way someone new 
		can get in the book is with some kind of group 
		stunt.
Homer:		Group stunt?
Record Lady:	Like the town that made the world's largest omelet.
Homer:		Denver?
Record Lady:	No, Spanish.
		[ba-dum-bum!  Homer plays a banjo flourish]
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% If it's a group stunt that the Duff Record people want, it's a group
% stunt they'll get.  Homer gathers together as many townsfolk as he
% can, and announces his goal:  To set the record for world's tallest
% human pyramid.  The people are enthusiastic about the chance to give
% Springfield a *real* claim to fame, as opposed to their old claim
% about being the birthplace of the Beatles.
%
% Later, a huge pyramid of people rises on a vacant lot inside town. 
% Homer pauses briefly to make sure everything's going to plan.  (It's
% a pretty simple plan -- just a big triangle.)  Interestingly,
% Homer's knowledge of civil engineering and physics lead him to
% believe that the best place for a man of his physique is at the very
% top of the pyramid.  He starts to climb up, but gets exhausted
% halfway to the top.  At first, he proposes making a base camp there,
% and going for the top tomorrow, but the others in the pyramid will
% have none of that.  Bart yells that Homer can go for the title of
% World's Laziest Stunt Organizer.
%
% The taunt motivates Homer to climb the rest of the way.  It isn't an
% easy task.  Near the top, Homer tries to get a grip on Bumblebee
% Man's "stinger," but it breaks off, and Homer falls.  He breaks his
% fall halfway down by grabbing onto some fellow's foot, and then
% successfully climbs back to the top.
% 
% The Duff Record Lady measures the pyramid from a cherry picker's
% basket.  The townspeople are a foot shy of the record.  Homer
% snatches victory from defeat by putting Maggie on top of his head. 
% Now all the people have to do is hold the pyramid pose for "three
% Mississippis," and the record will be theirs!
%
% Unfortunately, two seconds later, Jimbo and Kearney realize their
% hands are touching.  Ew!  They recoil, and the sudden removal of
% support causes a chain reaction that collapses the whole pyramid and
% forms a giant ball of people.  The people-ball rolls down the hill,
% and nothing in its path can stop it.
%
% Meanwhile, a man in town prepares to jump off a ledge.

Man:	Goodbye, cruel world.
	[he jumps, and lands on the people-ball just as it passes by]
	Hello, ironic twist!
-- The world's most ironic twist, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% The townspeople land in a heap near a truck weighing station.  As
% they try to recover from their trip, the Record Man notices
% something interesting.  The total weight of the people is 64,152
% pounds (29098.858 kilograms).

Record Man:	Wait a minute -- look at the scale.
Record Lady:	[enters numbers into a calculator] Divide by the 
		number of people, subtract belts and shoes ...
Record Man:	[sees the answer] Oh!
		[to the people] Everyone, welcome to the Duff Book 
		of World Records.  Springfield is the world's 
		fattest town.
		[everyone cheers]

% Marge isn't joining the celebration, though.  She wonders why the

% eats a grapefruit, he dips it in a bag of sugar, and then licks it
% off before throwing the rest away.
%
% At the Kwik-E-Mart, Marge has little luck in finding healthier food
% for her family.

		close-up of box so the audience can see that it 
		reads, "Sugar, Free Donuts"]
Marge:		Oh.  Apu, everything in this store is overloaded 
		with sugar.
Hibbert:	Marge has a point.  Sugar is not only fattening it's 
		also terribly, terribly addictive.  Uh, is my carton 
		of Pixy Stix in?
Apu:		No, it hasn't come in yet.
Hibbert:	[slams his fist on the counter] Dammit!  When they 
		come in, you call me at this number.  [hands Apu a 
		slip of paper and leaves]
Apu:		[reading] 9-1-1.
		[to Marge] I am sorry, but everything in this store 
		from the Honey-Glazed Cauliflower to the Choco-
		Blasted Baby Aspirin comes from the Motherloving 
		Sugar Corporation.

%
% Marge, Lisa, and Gil meet to discuss their legal strategy.  To
