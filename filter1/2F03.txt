         isn't there a little _Uter_ in all of us?  [chuckles] In fact,
         you might even say we just _ate_ Uter and he's in our
         _stomachs_ right now!  [laughs] Wait...scratch that one.
-- A little too literal, "Treehouse of Horror V"

% Lisa and Bart run down stairs that evening in a panic.

     Lisa: Mom!  Mom!  You've gotta help: they're cooking kids in the
           school cafeteria!
    Marge: Listen, kids: you're eight and ten years old now.  I can't be
           fighting all your battles for you.
     Bart: But Mom --
    Marge: No buts!  You march right back to that school, look them
           straight in the eye, and say "Don't eat me"!
Bart+Lisa: [disappointed] OK.
-- A new twist on an old saying, "Treehouse of Horror V"

% A much-fatter Mrs. Krabappel writes "Homework: eat a stick of butter"
% on the blackboard.  "Since so many students have been put on permanent
% detention," she begins, then burps, "we've merged everyone into a
% single class.  I trust there are no objections?"  Bart, Lisa,
% Milhouse, Wendell, and Ralph say nothing.  Wendell shivers in fright
% and his pencil falls to the floor.  Mrs. Krabappel looks up, points to
% the hall, and says, "Detention".  Wendell looks appealingly at
% Milhouse and Ralph who look away, and he leaves the class.
%
% Milhouse gasps as he notices Mrs. K reading "The Joy of Cooking
% Milhouse".  "Hey, you guys, I was just thinking that any one of us
% could be next.  So what do you say we make a break for it?"  The two
% Simpson children nod, and the three crawl out of the room.
%
% As they tiptoe down the hall, Bart can't resist looking into the
% detention room.  It's now set up with small cages in which children
% are given some sort of IV.  Martin looks haggard in his cage and he
% shakes convulsively, bringing an admonishment from Skinner: "Easy
% there, young man, you'll only make yourself tired and stringy.  Now,
% to check on the free-range children," he continues, looking out the
% window at a pasture of children running around.
%
% Lunch lady Doris catches the children escaping and she walk towards
% them slowly with an eggbeater.

Willy: Hold on, kids!  I'm coming to rescue the lot of you!
        [Skinner appears and axes him]
       Argh!  Oh, I'm bad at this.
-- Groundskeeper Willy, zero for three, "Treehouse of Horror V"

% The children are backed down the hall towards the auditorium.

Skinner: I'm going to enjoy devouring you, Bart Simpson.  Yes...I
         believe I'll start, as you've so often suggested, by eating
         your shorts.
          [Skinner turns a food processor on to "gooify" and backs the
         children towards it]
   Bart: Don't worry, guys.  Something _always_ comes along to save us.
          [Milhouse falls off the edge into the blender]
         Uh, nevertheless I remain confident that something will come
         along and save the two Simpson children...
-- They're needed for continuity, "Treehouse of Horror V"

% Bart wakes up screaming.

Marge: Relax, honey, you were just having a crazy nightmare.  You're
       back with your family now where there's nothing to be afraid
       of...except that fog that turns people out.
 Bart: Huh?
Homer: Uh oh, it's seeping in.  Stupid cheap weatherstripping!
-- The half-assed guide to weatherstripping, "Treehouse of Horror V"

% The family are indeed turned inside out.  The music for "One" begins.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:35]
%
% Over the credits, the family sings:
% 
% One!  -- chorus line of people, dancing till they make us stop
% Too!  -- many dancing people, covered with blood, gore, and glop.
% Just one sniff of that fog and you're inside out:
% It's worse than that flesh-eating virus you're read about!
% Vital organs, they are what we're dressed in,
% The family dog is eyeing Bart's intestine.
% Happy Hallowe'en!
%
% SLH drags Bart off, devouring him.
