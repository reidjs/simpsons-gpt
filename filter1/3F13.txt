% Many of the class is assembled to watch a film, "Young Jebediah
% Springfield".

I hope they show the time where they traded guns to the Indians for
corn, and then the Indians shot them and took the corn.
-- Bart watches "Young Jebediah Springfield", "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% The film is cheaply made.  After a "fight" with a "land cow",
% Jebediah is asked by a boy how he can hope to achieve such
% greatness.

 Jebediah: [on film] A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.
     Edna: Embiggens?  I never heard that word before I moved to
           Springfield
Ms.Hoover: I don't know why.  It's a perfectly cromulent word.
-- Nice supercalifragilisticexpialidocious word, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Skinner addresses the class after the film is over.

Skinner: Now, as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a
         week away.  Every class will do its part to make our local
         bicentennial just as memorable as our national bicentennial.
         Of course, you children are too young to remember that, with
         the possible exception of Kearney.
Kearney: [shaving] Those tall ships really lifted the nation's spirits
         after Watergate.
-- Quit bugging me about that stupid pirate, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Ms. Hoover tells the class that they are to do reports on Jebediah 
% and the top 18 essays will be put on file in the library.  Ralph asks
% if they can put pictures in it.  At home, Homer reads the news, and
% sees jobs available for the parade.  He wonders if he'll be a water
% churner, typhoid carrier, or an apprentice.

 Lisa: How about town crier?  You'd be great at that.
Homer: You think so?
 Bart: Well, yeah, Dad, you're a big fat loudmouth and you can walk
       when you have to.
-- Homer during the 200th anniversary of Springfield,
     "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Homer decides he'll do it.  Later, Lisa bikes to the Springfield
% Historical Society and checks out a little mechanized thing about
% river crossing.

Dangerous river crossings threatened life and limb but helped our
founding fathers save on bridge tolls.
-- Voiceover on a mechanized act of the founding of Springfield,
     "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% The voice turns out to be the curator, Hollis Hurlbut, talking into
% a coffee mug.

Hurlbut: Sorry if I startled you, but I do love to talk Jebediah, even
         when I'm drinking my chicory.
   Lisa: Hi, I'm Lisa Simpson.  I'm researching a report on Jebediah.
Hurlbut: Oh, you're in for a treat.  You know, some historians consider
        Jebediah a minor patriot, but I think you'll find he's easily
        the equal of William Dawes or even Samuel Otis.
-- Come again?, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Meanwhile, Homer runs ahead in line to audition for the town crier,
% but finds out Ned got the role.  Ned tries a pretty bad rendition.

  Homer: You su-diddely-uck, Flanders! [grabs a bell from him]
         Hear ye, hear ye!  Ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by 
         all!  Chooseth Homer Simpson, and he shalt rock thy world!
 Wiggum: Good God, he is fabulous.
Skinner: Yes, he's embiggened that role with his cromulent performance.
 Quimby: Top-notch criering, I admit, but the hat and bell belong to
         Ned Flanders, so no dice.
    Ned: Oh, they're just family heirlooms.  They shouldn't stand in
         the way of Homer taking my job.
  Homer: Less chat, more hat.
          [Ned hands it over.  Homer puts it on and it rips]
         Woo-hoo!  Hear ye, hear ye!  The Homer Broadcasting System is
         on the air!  All hollering, all the time!  I'm going to--
          [Quimby stops him]
 Quimby: You're going to restrict your criering to the parade and
         selected pre-approved publicity events!
  Homer: [meek] Okay.
-- Auditions for the part of town crier, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Mr. Hurlbut continues to show Lisa around.

This case holds our most treasured exhibit: objects owned and used by
Jebediah [Springfield].
 This is his fife, upon which he sounded the sweet note of freedom.
 And his hatchet, with which he hacked at the chains of oppresions.
 And his -- chamber pot.
-- Hollis Hurlbut, curator of Springfield Historical Society,
     "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Mr. Hurlbut hears a ding.  "Excuse me, my microwave jonnycakes are
% ready."  And leaves.  Lisa tries on a coonskin hat, and tries to
% sound a note on the fife.  But she succeeds only in blowing something
% out of the fife.  It's Jebediah's secret confessions.

Know ye who read this there is more to my life than history records.
Firstly, I did not tame the legendary buffalo.  It was already tame, I
merely shot it.  Secondly, I have not always been known as Jebediah
Springfield.  Until 1796, I was Hans Sprungfeld, murderous pirate, and
the half-wits of this town shall never learn the truth!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-
ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
I write this confession so that my infamy will live on after my body
has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria.

% Upon hearing this last bit, Lisa tries to get the diphtheria germs
% off her body.

% [End of Act One.  Time: 6'08"]

% Lisa remains dumbfounded until Mr. Hurlbut returns.

Hurlbut: Heere's jonnycakes.  Is everything okay?  You look a bit
         flushed.
   Lisa: It's just the excitement from studying Jebediah.
Hurlbut: Looks like you've come down with a serious case of Jebeditis.
   Lisa: Just as I was getting over my Chester A. Arthritis.
Hurlbut: [laughs] You had arthritis?
   Lisa: [chuckles nervously] No.

% Homer gets into his role of town crier the next morning.

Homer: [ringing bell] Hear ye, hear ye!  What's for breakfast!
Marge: Toast.
Homer: I don't understand thee, Marge.
Marge: [sighs] Ye olde toast.
Homer: Ooh.
-- Homer gets his role as town crier, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Lisa tells Homer the story of Jebediah/Hans.

 Lisa: Jebediah Springfield was really a vicious pirate named Hans
       Sprungfeld.  His tongue was bitten off by a Turk in a grog house
       fight.
Homer: No tongue, eh?  How did he talk and eat [melodramatically] and
       laugh and love?
 Lisa: He had it replaced with a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
Homer: Yes, that'll do.
-- "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Lisa tells the story of how Jebediah tried to kill George Washington.
% And earns a reprimand from Marge.  But Homer reassures Lisa that he
% believes her.

% In class...

Hoover: Ralph, A.  Janey, A.  And Lisa, for your, ahem, essay "Jebediah
        Springfield: Super Fraud", F.
  Lisa: But it's all true.
Hoover: [scoffs] This is nothing but dead, white male-bashing from a PC
        thug.  It's women like you that keep the rest of us from 
        landing a husband.
-- Ralph got an A?, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Lisa comes home sobbing, and tells Homer that she got an F.  Homer
% decides to go and wreck the school with a baseball bat.  But Lisa
% would rather get the confession.  Homer sticks with the bat idea,
% though.

% At the historical society, Homer and Lisa go after Jebediah's fife.
% Mr. Hurlbut scans it briefly and dismisses it.

Hurlbut: I think, Lisa, that you've been taken in by an obvious
         forgery.  Unfortunately, historical research is plagued by
         this sort of hoax -- the so-called confession.  It's just
         as fake as the Howard Hughes will, the Hitler Diaries, or the
         Emancipation Retraction.
   Lisa: But it explains why there's no record of Jebediah Springfield
         before 1796.  He was Hans Sprungfeld until then.
Hurlbut: That's preposterous.  Get out!  You're banned from this
         historical society!  You, and your children, and your
         children's children -- for three months.
-- "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Lisa decides to make posters about the fact that Jebediah is a fraud.

 Lisa: Okay, I'd like 25 copies in canary, 25 in goldenrod, 25 in
       saffron, and 25 in paella.
Clerk: OK, 100 yellow.
-- At a copy center, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

Comic book guy: Question: is your name Ripley Scott or James Cameron?
         Homer: No, it's Homer.
Comic book guy: Then I would thank you to stop peering at my
                screenplay, _Homer_.  And if I see a movie where
                computers threaten our personal liberties, I will know
                you have stolen my idea.
         Homer: But I'm just waiting for my kid.
                [thinking] Mental note -- steal his idea.
-- At a copy center, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Lisa tries posting them in the Kwik-E-Mart.

Lisa: Hi, Apu.  Can I put these posters up in your window?
 Apu: Well, of course you can, you little pixy.  You are just as sweet
      as the stix which bear your name.
       [Apu sees the poster]
      No, no, no.  Take that down.  As a semi-legal immigrant, your
      poster could land me in a predicament as red-hot as the candies
      which bear that name.

% Lisa tries Moe's Tavern, with the help of her dad.

 Homer: Hear ye, hear ye.  My daughter has something to say about
        Jebediah Springfield.
   Moe: Aw, look.  That cutie wants to say something cute.
         [barflies murmur]
        Shut up, you bums, shut up! 
        Go ahead, angel.
  Lisa: Ahem.  Jebediah Springfield was nothing more than a murderous
        pirate who hated this town!
         [barflies and Moe's jaws drop]
   Moe: Good God!  Homer, I support, you know, any prejudice you can
        name, but this hero-phobia sickens me.  All right, you and your
        daughter ain't welcome here no more.  Barney, show them the
        exit.
Barney: There's an exit?!
-- Thought it was a portal of natural light, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Moe snitches on the town jubilation committee, who place Homer and
% Lisa under questioning.

Quimby: You are tampering with forces you cannot understand.  We have
        major corporations sponsoring this event.
  Lisa: I hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration of a murderous
        pirate.
   Man: A pirate?  Well, that's hardly the image we want for Long John
        Silver's!
-- Respectable ship hijackers, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

Hurlbut: No, that's the skeletion _of_ Jebediah.
-- Jebediah Springfield's body is exhumed, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Lisa suggests looking in his shoes, but Wiggum sticks to looking in
% the skull.  There is no silver tongue.

Wiggum: Well, that settles it.  There is no silver tongue... is there,
        bonesy?
         [takes Jebediah's skull and uses it as a dummy]
        [as skull] Oh, I wish chief.  With that kind of dough, I could
        buy me some eyeballs!  [laughs]
        That's the spirit, bonesy.  Why don't you sing a song for
        the nice people?
        [as skull] Okay!  Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-dah

% Lisa dreams of Jebediah chastising him, but George Washington tosses
% him out the window, and urges Lisa to keep on going.  "There's only
% one piece left in the puzzle."  Lisa doesn't want to continue...

We had quitters in the Revolution, too.  We called them Kentuckians!
-- George Washington (in Lisa's dream), "Lisa the Iconoclast"

Washington: Looks like I'm going to have to find another little girl

      Lisa: No, not Janey!   She'll pack the Supreme Court with _boys_!
-- Big change, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% At school, milk and cookies are handed out...

 Ralph: Can you open my milk, mommy?
Hoover: I'm not mommy, Ralph.  I'm Miss Hoover.
-- "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Everyone is right to laugh at Ralph, and do, except Lisa, who stares
% at the incomplete portrait of George Washington and realizes the
% answer.  She runs to the historical society and Mr. Hurlbut protests,
% but Lisa has deduced that Mr. Hurlbut stole the silver tongue.
% After a while, he confesses.  Then Lisa tells her part of the story:
% the paper the confession is written on is the bottom half of the
% portrait of George Washington.  After the fight, that piece stuck on
% Hans' shoe.  Mr. Hurlbut and Lisa decide to stop the celebration,
% but Lisa cannot.  She succumbs, and tells Mr. Hurlbut that the myth
% of Jebediah has brought out the good in everyone.

% Homer looks at Ned with scorn as he takes on his role as town crier.
% Finally, he has enough and confronts him mid-cry...

   Ned: Well, hey, it's Homer.  Good to see you, neigh--

 Homer: Get lost!
