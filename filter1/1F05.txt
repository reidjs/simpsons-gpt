% At the breakfast table, Bart makes faces at Lisa to annoy her.  She
% asks him repeatedly to stop, but he ignores her.  "Mom!"  Lisa calls,
% "Bart's making faces!"  Marge asks Bart to stop it and tells Homer to
% speak to him.  But Homer's too busy making faces at Santa's Little
% Helper and Snowball II.  "Stupid animals," he scoffs.
%
% Tiring of that, Homer picks up the newspaper and sighs, "Ah...the
% daily newspaper."  He turns to the "FOR FREE" section.

Ooh!  The Springfield Men's Shelter is giving away sixty soiled
mattresses!

% Marge asks Homer why he bothers reading that section of the paper.
% "They never have anything good."  But as she finishes, Homer gasps at
% an ad he has just spied: "FREE TRAMPOLINE, 534 Center St."

Homer: Oh my God!
 Lisa: What is it?
Homer: Tramapoline!  Trampopoline!  [runs out]
 Bart: He said what now?
Marge: Please, don't bring home any more old crutches!
-- Homer gets excited over a free trampoline, "Bart's Inner Child"

% Homer drives at breakneck speed to the address given in the paper.  On
% the way, he spies a car backing out of a driveway.  "Oh no you don't,"
% he vows, "that trampoline is mine!" as he plows into the right rear
% side of the other car and knocks it on its side.
%
% Once he arrives, he hastily parks on the other side of the road and
% runs, panting, to the front door.  When he pushes the doorbell button,
% the noise it makes is the same as the one a bicycle horn makes, and a
% jet of water sprays him in the face.  Homer is confused; he presses
% the doorbell again, and the same thing happens.  Finally
% understanding, he begins to laugh, and holds down the button while a
% jet of water sprays him continuously.  He lets it splash over
% different parts of his head while he giggles with merriment.
%
% But the owner of the house finally answers the door.  It's Krusty!
% "Hey!" he reprimands upon seeing Homer dousing himself, "that seltzer
% ain't free!"  Homer is surprised to find who lives in the house:
% "Krusty!"  The jovial clown laughs, "That's me!"

Krusty: You here for the trampoline?
 Homer: Yeah.  What's the deal?
Krusty: Well, I used to do a lot of tumbling in my act, but I'm phasing
        it out for more dirty limericks: "There once was a man named
        Enis..."
-- Krusty gives away a trampoline, "Bart's Inner Child"

% Homer thinks it's too good to be true: "And I can just haul it away,
% free?"  Krusty assures him, "It's all yours," and laughs evilly.
% Homer drives away with the trampoline strapped to the roof, and Krusty
% peeks out from behind a curtain to make sure Homer is well and truly
% gone.
%
% Back at home, Bart sits in his room with Santa's Little Helper.  As
% Bart pets his dog, he hears a "Hi, son" coming from the direction of
% his window.  He looks up, and Homer appears quickly at the window and
% says, "Hi, son" again before disappearing again.  "Wow!" exclaims
% Bart, realizing Homer is bouncing on the trampoline.  He runs outside
% to where Homer has set it up.  Lisa is already watching Homer enjoying
% himself.  "I can't believe it!" says Bart incredulously.

Dad, this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering!
-- Lisa, after Homer gets a trampoline for the family, "Bart's Inner

% merrily.

% Marge watches the antics of the three.

       house, and it was free!  Free!
-- Why trampolines are good, "Bart's Inner Child"

% Marge is still worried: "Are you sure it's safe?"  Homer stops
% bouncing and says, "Absolutely.  And this is just the beginning...I've
% got some big plans."
%
% In Homer's plans, we see Homer standing below a crudely painted sign
% announcing, "Homerland, Admission $50".  He collects the admission fee
% from Ralph Wiggum, who's at the head of a long line of children
% waiting to get in.  At "Trampoline Wold", Martin, Sherri, Terri, and
% another boy bounce happily on the trampoline.  At "Muckville USA",
% Lewis and two other children play in a mud pit, while Nelson throws a
% ball of mud at one of the children.  At "Fort Adventure", Homer has
% built a fort out of the aforementioned soiled mattresses.  As Milhouse
% crawls out of hit, he observes, "It smells funny in there."  Homer
% contradicts him, "No it doesn't."
%
% Back in the here and now, Homer is charging admission to use the
% trampoline.  Otto is currently using it and having a ball.  But he
% jumps too close to the edge and lands with his back across the metal
% frame with a bone-crunching smash.

Bart: Otto, are you OK?
Otto: Yeah.  Just pop my shoulder back in.  [Bart does so] Thanks,
      little buddy!
-- Otto injures himself on the trampoline, "Bart's Inner Child"

% Otto sees Wendell has begun jumping on the trampoline, and he rues, "I

% a spring, and he cries, "Oh!  My arm!"  Ralph jumps next, but his
% tongue is hanging out of his mouth while he jumps, and he bites it
% accidentally.  Next up are Rod and Todd Flanders

Todd: Each leap brings us closer to God.

% Marge is watching from nearby.  "Homer, this is terrible!"  Homer
% sneers, "OK, OK, I'll take care of it," and he hammers a small

% so, he glances up, and the camera pans to show a huge field full of

% Homer decides to throw the trampoline off a cliff.  He pushes it over

% {That night, Homer is still trapped under the trampoline.  A wolf
% howls in the background.  "I'm thirsty," Homer whines, but just then,

%
% {Homer's next plan is to use a buzzsaw to slice the trampoline to
% pieces.  "Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline," he announces, and runs towards
% it, screaming maniacally while the buzzsaw whirls.  Unfortunately, his
% extension cord isn't quite long enough, and the cord snaps taut
% suddenly, spilling Homer onto his back and causing him to throw the
% buzzsaw into the air.  The saw lands on the trampoline and wraps the

-- James Brown, closet carpenter, "Bart's Inner Child"

Marge: Er, I don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation,
       but my inner critic says you should have done your job!
  Ned: Hey, now, Marge, let's not "should" this fellow to death.

% Willy concurs: "Yeah!  Next you'll be laying a guilt trip on me for
% not oiling that ferris wheel."  As he finishes, sparks fly from where
% the ferris wheel joins the support, and it breaks off, rolling down
% the street and through the gates to the Springfield zoo.  A horde of
% ferocious animals burst forth and the crowd screams in panic.

      Quimby: In the spirit of the occasion, I must tell you what I
              think.  You two screwed up royal!
      Worker: Ya know, I really don't feel like being blamed.
     Skinner: I feel that you should shut up!
         Moe: You know, you really irritate me, Skinner, what with your
              store-bought haircut and excellent posture.
Hot- dog boy: Mister, I can't stand the sound of your voice!
         Moe: Oh, really?  [pushes him]
     Hibbert: Oh, now, now: there's no need to resort to violence.
         Moe: Oh, sure there is!  [punches the boy]
-- So much for owning their okayness, "Bart's Inner Child"

% Everyone starts brawling, and Marge and Rev. Lovejoy watch.

  Marge: I knew it.  If only I had nagged more!
Lovejoy: God is angry: we've made a false idol of this Brad Goodman.

-- And the Lord said..., "Bart's Inner Child"

% Apu is quick to point out that the whole thing is really Bart's fault.
% The hot-dog boy yells, "Get him!" and Bart says, "Eep."  He begins
% running away.  Fortunately, Homer is hidden inside a "Free as a Bird"
% float, and he snatches Bart and hides him in the driver's box inside
% the float.  "Hold on, son!" he exhorts, as he slams the gas pedal to
% the floor.  The speedometer creeps up to five MPH.
%
% But even this is too fast to hold the colorful tissue on the float.
% It all blows off, leaving just the steel skeleton with Bart and Homer
% ensconced in it.  "So long, suckers!"  Homer jeers as they make their
% getaway.

Skinner: Damn...they're very slowly getting away!
    Moe: They're heading for the old mill!
  Homer: No we're not.
    Moe: Well, let's go to the old mill anyway -- get some cider!

% That night, the Simpsons sit together watching TV.

Homer: Aw, boy: if only Bart had been a better role model for everyone.
Marge: That's not fair.  The lesson here is that self-improvement is
       better left to people who live in big cities.
 Lisa: No!  Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick fix:
       it's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery.
Homer: That's what I've been saying!  We're all fine the way we are!
-- Homer, master paraphraser, "Bart's Inner Child"

    Homer: Ooh!  It's that new show about the policeman who solves
           crimes in his spare time.
     Bart: Crank it, Homer!
    Chief: You busted up that crack house pretty bad, McGonigle.  Did
           you really have to break so much furniture?
McGonigle: You tell me, Chief.  You had a pretty good view from behind
           your desk.
    Homer: Ah, McGonigle: eases the pain.
    Chief: You're off the case, McGonigle!
McGonigle: You're off _your_ case, Chief!
    Chief: What does that mean exactly?
    Homer: [yelling] It means he gets results, you stupid chief!
     Lisa: Dad, siddown.
    Homer: Oh, I'm sorry.
