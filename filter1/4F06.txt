Brockman: A clean-up effort is already underway, and as always, the

[lauging]  No, no.  H-help, h-help.  I'm gonna die.
-- Very perceptive, "Bart After Dark"

% Bart survives his fall to the ground, but has brought the attention of

 Bart: He's tough but fair.  I'll start sorting these bras.
Belle: That's a bit advanced for you, but I know a stopped-up sink that

 Bart: Just glad to be on the team.

% Next thing, Belle introduces Bart to other tasks.

Belle: Well, whoever fits Mel's tuxedo.  [Size: extra small]

      birthday suit.
       [rim shot, heavy laughs]

     Moe: Yeah, well what's wrong with this house?  Is it the plumbing?
