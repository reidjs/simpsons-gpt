% Homer hangs outside the shuttle still, and the handle finally gives in
% and snaps off.  Fortunately, Buzz and Race are there to grab him.

 Buzz: Homer, you broke the handle.
 Race: With that hatch open, we'll burn up on re-entry!  That's it: if I
       go, I'm taking you to hell with me.
Homer: Wait a minute, Race.  Wait a minute...wait!
        [breaks off a support rod]
       Aha!  Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours!
        [tries to swing it, but it catches in the door]
       Aw, stupid bar.
 Buzz: Wait, Homer.  If that bar holds, we just might make it back to
       earth.
Homer: Oh.  [voice rising] I'll bash you good!
-- One-track minds, "Deep Space Homer"

Well, this reporter was...possibly a little hasty earlier and would like
to...reaffirm his allegiance to this country and its human president.
May not be perfect, but it's still the best government we have.  For
now.
 [notices "HAIL ANTS" sign taped up, tears it down]
Oh, yes, by the way, the spacecraft still in extreme danger, may not
make it back, attempting risky reentry, bla bla bla bla bla bla.  We'll
see you after the movie.
-- Kent Brockman, backpedaling furiously, "Deep Space Homer"

% On the dangerous trip back through the atmosphere, the shuttle heats
% up until it glows red.  Buzz and Race hum, "The Battle Hymn of the
% Republic," while Homer sings, "Oh, those Golden Grahams.  Oh, those
% Golden Grahams.  Crispy, crunchy, graham cereal, brand new breakfast
% treat..."

% The Simpson family still watch in suspense.

Lisa: Come on, Dad.  You can make it!
 Abe: Aw, of course he'll make it.  It's TV.
-- Metahumor, "Deep Space Homer"

% The spaceship hurtles towards the earth at a dangerous speed.  It
% smashes into the building where the press is housed, which is
% convenient in terms of post-trip interviews.

     Tom: Uh, how'd you solve the door dilemma?
    Buzz: Homer Simpson was the real hero here.  He jury-rigged the door
          closed using this.
   Man 1: Hey, what is that?
   Man 2: It's an inanimate carbon rod!
Everyone: Yay!
           [Time magazine cover: "In Rod We Trust"]
-- Rod Flanders?  Nope, "Deep Space Homer"

% A parade is organized in honor of the rod.  It gets to ride in its own
% limousine.  The family watch the parade, but Homer turns the TV off
% angrily.

       [Homer shuts off the TV]
 Bart: Aw, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod!
Homer: Oh, stupid rod!  I got gypped.
Marge: Oh, Homey, you should be proud!  Only a handful of people have
       done what you've done.
 Lisa: Yeah, Dad!  How many people have seen the icecaps and the deserts
       all at once, or the majesty of the Northern Lights from one
       hundred miles above?
Homer: Yeah, maybe I do have the right...what's that stuff?
-- Uh, stuff?, "Deep Space Homer"

% Homer thanks his wife and elder daughter.  "Bart, do you have
% something nice to say to your father?"  Bart, who has just written
% "HERO" on Homer's head, says, "Ehh, he knows how I feel."  He tosses
% the marker in the air, and we watch it close up, tumbling slowly.

% It turns into a FOX satellite in space, descending slowly to "Also
% Sprach Zarathustra".  It hits a glass ball containing a baby Homer in
% it, who says, "D'oh!" indignantly.
