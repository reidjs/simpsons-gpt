% Moe Szyslak, bartender of Moe's Bar, checks his watch. It's just about time
% for the evening rush. He grabs a broomstick and thuds the floor, to get rid
% of the rats that infest his cabinets and floor. Just after the rats clear
% off, Homer and his associates - Lenny, Carl, two barflies - enter.

 Homer: Evening, Moe.
Barney: [walks out the men's room wearing a bathrobe and brushing his teeth]
        Morning Moe.
-- Ah, I just don't know anymore, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

Yeah, all right. Listen up, guys. The Springfield Police have told me that
ninety one percent of all traffic accidents are causes by you six guys.
-- Moe, talking to his barflies, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% The barflies celebrate, but the celebration is cut off soon enough. "Yeah,
% I know, I know.  The bad news is we're gonna have to start having designated
% drivers," concludes Moe. The barflies moan.

We'll choose the same way they pick the pope. [Moe reaches under the table for
a large jar of pickled eggs] Everyone reach in a draw a pickled egg. Whoever
gets the black egg stays sober tonight.
-- Moe choosing a designated driver, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Each barfly draws a pickled egg. Last is Barney, who slowly unwraps his
% fingers revealing the black egg. He screams at the top of his lungs, and in
% rage, crushes the egg in his hand.

You got the black one.
-- Homer Simpson stating the obvious, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Later into the night, the denizens of the bar are drunk out of their minds.
% Homer is being carried around in his underwear. Everyone is having a great
% time - except Barney, who is sitting the remainder of the night alone.

Look at me! I'm Peter Pantsless!
-- Homer Simpson, being carried around in his underwear at Moe's, "The City
Of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Barney sits on his own, munching on peanuts, shaking all the way. In the
% distance, party music can be heard. It gets louder. Barney seems to know
% what it is, praying to God - not tonight. The Duff Partymobile parks
% outside Moe's, and two cheerleaders clear the entrance for Duffman.

Hey look, it's Duffman; the guy in a costume that creates awareness of Duff!
-- Lenny, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

Duffman wants to party down with the man that sent 10,000 Duff labels for me
to be here tonight.
-- Duffman, on Barney Gumble, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Duffman has a large mug of Duff in store for Barney. It is presented. The
% small crowd in Moe's begin chanting "Chug! Chug!", but Barney reminds them
% he's the designated driver.
% Later that evening, Barney is driving Homer, Lenny and Carl back to their
% homes. The three drunks give their best shot at singing "Macarena".

Barney: Please, I'm trying to drive!
 Lenny: Hey, let's go to the girls college!
  Carl: No! Playboy Mansion, Playboy Mansion!
 Homer: It's my car, and I say we're going to the Lost City of Gold!
Barney: [angry] Oh, that's just drunk talk!  [dreamy] Sweet, beautiful drunk
        talk...
-- "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Barney drops off Homer at his house. Homer warns him to bring the car back
% tomorrow [just slip it under the door]. Barney agrees [with a plan up his
% sleeve, as we can here in his voice], and drives away, as Homer stumbles to
% his front door, opens it, and slumps to the ground.

% Two months later, Homer is stood outside Moe's [with Moe], pinning up posters
% declaring his car missing.

   Moe: Face it Homer, the car is gone. Barney ain't never coming back.
        [a limo pulls up]
Driver: Here we are, Mr. Gumble.
-- Uh... I meant Barney Rubble, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Homer immediately confronts Barney about his car, as the limo drives away.

All I can remember about the last two months is giving a guest lecture at
Villanova. Or maybe that was a street corner...
-- Barney, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% With no knowledge of his vehicle's whereabouts, Homer scolds Barney. "I
% ought to punch you in the nose!  But I have to pick my kids up at school"
% he says, as he sets off -- on a scooter.

% Later on, Homer is constructing a replacement for his previous car. It's
% basically a car, only it consists of torches, a mattress, and various other
% oddities. Homer rolls on a fourth tyre.

Marge: Homer, I don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself.
Homer: Marge, you can stand there finding faults or you can knit me some
       seatbelts.
Marge: Sorry, sorry. [Marge starts work on some seatbelts, cheerfully]
-- That's my girl, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

 Lisa: Dad, you got a letter from the city of New York!
Homer: Pfft. Throw it away. Nothing good has ever came out of New York City.
-- "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Ignoring Homer's not-wanting-the-letter, Lisa reads it for him. The opening
% line mentions Homer's vehicle, sparking an interest after all.

 Lisa: Dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the burrow of
       Manhattan.
Homer: My vehicle!
 Lisa: If you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car
       will be thrown into the East River at your expense.
-- A fair punishment, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Homer pleads he doesn't want to go.

New York is a hellhole. And you know how I feel about hellholes!
-- Homer, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

Lisa: Dad, you can't judge a place you've never been to.
Bart: Yeah, that's what people do in Russia.
-- Let's not forget Czechoslovakia, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

[sigh] It's about time I told you about a chapter of my life that I had hoped
would be closed forever. I was on my way to the Harrisburg coat outlet to buy
an irregular coat. [grimly] But it required a stop over in New York City.
-- Homer Simpson, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Begin flashback...
% Young Homer is in New York City. Trusting a stranger with his camera, Homer
% has his photo taken. The guy takes the photograph -- and the camera. Homer
% explains to a police officer what happened. The police officer looks
% reassuringly concerned, but grabs Homer's suitcase and runs away with it.
% Homer notices an electronic marquee announcing "Crime is up 8,000,000
% percent" [that WOULD explain a lot]. Someone nabs his wallet, and a bird
% swoops down only to take Homer's hotdog. A man, from his window, empties
% a bag of garbage out of his window; no prizes for guessing who it lands on.
% Homer takes a banana peel from his face, and tosses it behind him. It hits
% a Huggy-Bear type pimp, who chases Homer, who finally finds a ladder --
% that goes down a manhole.
% ... end flashback.

% The Simpsons - minus Homer - would love to go to NYC. Upon learning the
% trip would cost only nine dollars, Bart offers to pay.

Marge: Great! We're all going to New York!
Homer: Lousy Bart with his money. All right New York! I'm coming back! But
       you're not getting this! [Homer grabs his wallet and tosses it into
       the fireplace]
 Lisa: Dad, our baby pictures were in there.
Homer: Don't you start!
-- "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:38]

% OFF are in the coach on the way to NYC. They awaken from their naps.

Bart: That took too long! How come we had to transfer in Atlanta twice?
Lisa: I say we should have paid the extra $1.50 and gotten a bus with
      restrooms.
-- Hmmm. I'd rather have the $1.50, "The City of New York Vs. Homer
Simpson"

% Homer wakes up, and puts his hands on his legs, but can't seem to feel
% them. They're the legs of Wadlow, the very tall man behind Homer who
% stands up, bends over and glares at Homer, angrily.  New York, here we
% are!

[excited] Wow, I feel like such a nobody!
-- Marge, entering New York City, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Bart, however, spots two rabbi's walking a long. He assumes it's the

 Bart: Look. It's ZZ Top! You guys rock!
Rabbi: Eh, maybe a little.
-- "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% OFF arrive at the station, and get out the bus.

Homer: Now remember, criminals prey on small town folk like us. So if

Marge: Homer, you're scaring the children.
-- Halloween special early this season? "The City of New York Vs. Homer

Homer: Good! I don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death

Marge: The bus station is just ONE of the sites we came to see. We'll meet
       you at central park at five o'clock.
Homer: Oh, all right. But not a minute later cause when the sun goes down

% Back to Homer. Homer is waiting by his car, impatiently. {He notices the

-- Life in New York, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Homer phones the number on the boot at a nearby phone booth. He gets

Male rough voice: Grabowski.
-- And don't you forget it, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

They expect me to sit here from nine to five? That's how many hours? [Homer
checks his wrist watch] ten, eleven, denominator, er... Where's Lisa when you
need her?!
-- Homer the genius, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Except Homer, the Simpsons are travelling via the subway. Lisa is talking
% to a bum.

Lisa: Here's a better idea. You give me your address and I'll write to you.
 Bum: OK.  Send it to Jesus, uh, care of the Pentagon.
-- Which `the Pentagon' are we talking about here? "The City of New York Vs.
Homer Simpson"

% Marge marvels at advertisements in the subway car, as Bart [in a different
% part of the car] tries to win money via sympathy by demonstrating his lack
% of taste buds by licking a pole.

% Meanwhile, Homer is sat on the ground by his car, impatiently awaiting the
% arrival of Steve Grabowski, the parking officer.

Homer: {Aww, c'mon, pick up the pace!}
       {[a man drops some spare change for Homer]}

       {Lousy cheapskate.}
-- Times have changed, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% {Homer adds up his change and discovers he has enough to buy a pizza from
% across the road.} He's hungry, but can't leave the car, so he puts his
% foot on the bumper, and stretches as far as he can go, but it is, of
% course, still completely out of reach. He grabs a twig from the ground,
% but is still pretty much the same distance away.  A foreign man, pushing
% a trolley of what sounds like a foreign food, pulls up. The man is
% selling a food called `Klauh Kalesh'. Homer asks the vendor if he could
% go across the road and buy him a slice of pizza, but the vendor
% refuses - he only sells Klauh Kalesh. Homer orders a bowl [a stick, as
% he is corrected], and wolves it down.

 Homer: [licks Klauh Kalesh] That's just awful.
        [soon, Homer has finished the `awful' snack, and is licking the
        stick to get every last morsel.]
-- Absolutely disgusting, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

 Homer: Now what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth?
Vendor: Mountain Dew or crab juice.
 Homer: Blecch!  Ew!  Sheesh!  I'll take a crab juice...
-- Good choice, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Homer drinks a can of crab juice. And another. And another. Needing to
% urinate, Homer tries to drain the lizard into a mailbox, but is stopped
% by the mailwoman. The only alternative is the observation deck in the
% tower.

% OFF, minus Homer, are walking through Chinatown, surrounded by China
% reminiscent stores.

Marge: Are we still in Little Italy?
 Lisa: Actually, I think we're in Chinatown now.
Marge: Only in New York!
-- "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Lisa spots some rabbits in a butcher shop's window.

 Lisa: [gasps] Mom, are those rabbits dead?
Marge: No, no, Lisa they're just sleeping, upside down... and inside out...
-- Looking into the butcher window, "The City of New York Vs. Homer
Simpson"

% Marge spots Bart looking closely at the fireworks store across the road.
% Under Marge's order, he puts down a lit firework which starts a chain
% reaction resulting in the bulk of the store's fireworks setting off.

Oh no! Chinese fire drill! Serious this time!
-- the fireworks store owner, when Bart creates a firework chain reaction,
"The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Meanwhile, Homer is waiting by his car, desperate to go to the bathroom.
% He speaks to nobody, and sees a sign on a bus that reads "Flushing
% Meadows," which leads him into a fantasy where he dances through a
% meadow with flushing toilets scattered all over the place.
% Back in reality, Homer can't take the pressure any more. He runs into
% tower one and gets into an elevator, pushing a lady out the way.

How frightfully rude! I do hope someone stabs him in the eye.
-- A New York citizen, upon coming into contact with Homer, "The City of
New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Homer pays the admission, and rushes through to the men's room. But to
% his terror, it is OUT OF ORDER. He gets back in the elevator, goes down
% and runs out tower one and into tower two. He uses the lift to reach
% the bathroom, and finally can urinate in peace. From outside, Homer's
% extremely loud, relieved moans can be heard. He glances from the window
% beside him and sees the parking officer writing another ticket. Nothing
% but bad luck today. Cue the annoyed grunt, which can be heard from all
% around the near distance.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 14:44]

% Homer returns to his car and reads the latest ticket, for $250. The sun
% begins to set.

Oh no... it's getting dark.  That's it! I'm getting out of this town
alive if it kills me!
-- Homer on New York, "The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"

% Homer gets into the car and accelerates like crazy, until the boot
% scrapes the steel around the wheel off. Homer drives onto the road
% slowly [the boot causes the car to bump up and down, Homer knocking
% his head on the ceiling each time].

% Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa are gazing dreamily into a window filled with
% glamorous shoes.

Lisa:  Look at all those beautiful shoes!  I know they're made from animals
       but WOW!
Marge: Mmmm, If only I didn't already have a pair of shoes.
Bart:  Speaking of shoes, I don't care about shoes.  I'll meet you ladies

-- "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"

% Bart finds the Mad Magazine office, and rushes inside, where there is a

Bart:      Excuse me, is this MAD magazine?
Secretary: No, it's Mademoiselle.  We're buying our sign on the

Bart:      [laughs] Seriously though, my name is Bart Simpson.  My father
           has a subscription.  I'd like the grand tour please.
Secretary: Listen kid, you probably think lots of crazy stuff goes on in

Bart:      Wow!  I'll never wash these eyes again!
-- "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"

% Back to Homer who is still driving his car with the boot on it.  The boot
% is flinging rocks at a truck which moves in to the other lane.  Because of
% the lack of speed caused by the boot, there is quite a bit of traffic
% behind Homer.  He turns on his radio.  "Everything is Beautiful" is
% playing which annoys Homer further, so he kicks his radio in.

% Meanwhile, Marge and the children are looking at a sign for a Broadway

% Homer is still driving his car down the road.  Checking his progress, he

Homer: Ah ha!  I've got it!  Brain, how can I ever thank you?
Brain: Just don't bump me on your way out of the car.
       [Homer gets out of his car, bumping his head on the way out]
Homer: Sorry.

Homer:  Hey!  Hey!  HEY!
Worker: What?
Homer:  The boss says you're fired.
Worker: I'll get him!
-- "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"

% While the worker is gone, Homer takes his jackhammer and uses it to try

% steam and the rear bumper falls off.  He does get the boot off, though.
% He then destroys the boot some more by grinding it with the jackhammer.

Homer one, New York nothing.
-- Homer, "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"

% Then Homer steps on the boot causing it to snap on his foot.  He smashes
% it against he front of his car to get it off.  When he does, he closes
% the hood of his car and thanks the other drivers for their patience.  A
% bullet hits a sign above Homer's head, suggesting that the drivers'
% patience might be running a little thin. Back into the car he goes.

% In Central Park, Marge and the children are in a horse drawn carriage.
