% The scene opens on the Stern Lecture Plumbing van ("I told you not to
% flush that"), then focuses on the Simpsons' basement window.  A
% plumber stands in a foot of water in front of a leaky pipe.

Plumber: Looks like you got a leak.
  Marge: Could you start fixing it pretty soon?  The basement is getting
         awfully flooded.  And I think the cat's down there.
          [Snowball II meows balefully from underwater]
Plumber: Yeah, I probably won't be able to get the parts I need for two,
         three weeks and that's if I order them today -- which I won't.
  Marge: Oh, dear.
          [his pager beeps; he looks, it shows "Low Battery"]
Plumber: Hmm, emergency call.  Gotta go.  [starts to leave]
  Homer: What should we do until you get back?
Plumber: Ehh, put a pan down there.

% Homer arrives at work quite late and pulls into the last available
% spot, right on the end of a row.  From the other side of a fence, Bart
% waves to him from his bedroom window: "Hi Dad!"  Homer makes
% dismissive noises and walks towards the power plant entrance.  As he
% gets close, Lenny and Carl pull up in their cars into parking spots
% right at the entrance.  "Hey," asks Homer suspiciously, "how come you
% guys got such great parking places?"  Lenny answers quietly, "It's a
% secret."  Carl tells him "Shh!  Shut up!"
%
% Homer walks to his station at work and sits on his chair, which
% promptly collapses.  He looks at the bottom of the stool, which reads
% "Econo-save budget stool: Factory Second".  "All right, Econo-save,
% you just made the list!"  Homer says menacingly, pulling out "Homer's
% Revenge List" and adding "Econo Save" to the end.
%
% He walks into the room where Carl and Lenny work and asks, "Hey!  Will
% you guys help me fix my -- " but stops when he sees them sitting in
% big, comfortable, vibrating chairs with their names on them.  "Hey...
% how come you guys got better chairs than me."  Lenny answers him
% again, "It's a secret!" and again Carl warns, "Shh!  Shut up!"
%
% At the soda machine, Lenny presses a ring with a special pattern onto
% it into a special place on the machine and gets a soda without paying
% for it.  Homer walks up, starts putting change in some change, and
% asks the boys if they want to go bowling tonight.  "Naw, we're busy,"
% replies Lenny, and Carl adds, "Yeah, we got, er, things to do."  "Like
% what?" asks Homer, slyly.  "Uh, it's a secret," says Lenny for the
% third time.  Carl, in the middle of drinking, stops and eyes Lenny,
% leaving Homer to say, "Shut up!"
%
% At dinner, Homer tells the family about his day.

Homer: So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays and they
       don't tell me where they go.  It's like a conspiracy.
 Bart: A conspiracy, eh?  You think they might be involved in the
       Kennedy assassination in some way?
Homer: I do...now.  Anyway, I'm going to follow them tonight and see
       where they go.
Marge: Oh, Homer, don't start stalking people again.  It's so _illegal_.
       Remember when you were stalking Charles Kuralt because you
       thought he dug up your garden?
Homer: Well, something did!
Marge: I don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
Homer: Oh, OK, have it your own way, Marge.  I'll be back in a minute

% The pair stop in front of a strange-looking building.  Homer's mouth
% opens wide in amazement.  Getting out, Lenny asserts, "There's our

% and when the man blocks his entrance, he turns around quickly, still
% humming.
%
% Inside, a large open hall is filled with men all wearing the same odd
% robes.  Homer, not deterred, is sprawled over the glass-dome skylight.

% At work the next day, Homer confronts his two chums.

Homer: I saw weird stuff in that place last night.  Weird, strange,

 Carl: We don't, uh, know what you're talking about, Homer.
Lenny: And you can't join the Stonecutters because it's too exclusive!
 Carl: [sighs] Well, it was a real nice secret organization we had once.

Homer: Stonecutters, eh?  How do I join?
Lenny: There are only two ways to gain membership: be the son of a

Homer: Next?
Lenny: -- or, save the life of a Stonecutter.

Homer: Hey!  [grabs it, stomps on it]
       I saved your life!  That egg sandwich could have killed you by
       cholesterol.
Lenny: Pfft, forget it, Homer.  While it has been established that eggs
       contain cholesterol, it has not yet been proven conclusively that
       they actually raise the level of serum cholesterol in the human
       blood stream.
Homer: So one of those Egg Council creeps got to you too, huh?
Lenny: Aw, you've got it all wrong, Homer.  It's not like that.

-- It was the best of times..., "Homer the Great"

% At the next Stonecutter meeting, Homer bangs his gavel as the crowd
% toast each other with beer steins.  They turn to face him and cheer.

Homer: Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson: helping others makes
       our own lives better and makes us better people.  So instead of
       just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use
       what we have to help the less fortunate.
        [crowd stares, dumbfounded; crickets chirp]
  Moe: He's gone mad with power like that Albert Schweitzer guy.
-- Albert, Adolf, what's the difference, "Homer the Great"

% So Homer starts a "Stonecutters Daycare Center" in front of the
% Stonecutter temple.  Homer seesaws with a bunch of kids at once;
% Barney is covered with children as he walks; Lenny and Carl play
% jumprope with a child.  At the top of a twirly tube slide, Moe calls
% "Whee!" and slides down with a child in his lap.  Only the child makes
% it to the bottom, though, as Moe calls out, "Ooh, for the love of God!
% Somebody get the jaws of life."
%
% Herman throws a ball at a child with his arm, and Monty Burns tries to
% push a child in a swing.  "Higher!" screams the hardly-moving child,
% "Higher!"  Monty intones, "Oh, I'll give you higher, my filthy little
% urchin," and pushes hard.  He forgets to move out of the way, though,
% and gets smucked in the face first, then the back of the head.
% "You've won this round," he concedes, only to get smacked by the child
% again.
%
% Homer assembles the crew to repaint an apartment building covered with
% graffiti.  The superintendent walks out and kisses Homer.  "It looks
% so much better...a beautiful sky blue," she admires as a helicopter
% crashes into it.
%
% At home, the pets watch Homer with respect as he talks to his family.

     Homer: You were right, Lisa: I've never felt so spiritually
            fulfilled.  And with my brothers the Stonecutters behind me,
            this is the beginning of a better world for all of us.
       Moe: We've got to kill him!
Number One: Take it easy, Moe.  Let's hear from the Stonecutter world
            council before we act too rashly.
   Orville: Kill him.
 Nicholson: Kill him.
     Mr. T: Kill the fool!
      Bush: I'm afraid I have to disagree with Orville, Jack, and Mr.
            Can't we just do something to his voice box?
-- Sage World Council advice, "Homer the Great"

Number One: We might as well face the truth: as long as we're
            Stonecutters, he will control our lives.
       Moe: Maybe...but _maybe_ we don't want to be Stonecutters no
            more.
             [a crane removes a "Baskin Robbins" sign and replaces it
            with "Abandoned Store"]
Number One: Silence!  I now call to order the first meeting of the
            ancient mystic society of...No Homers.
             [George Bush unveils a logo]
  Everyone: Yay!
     Homer: [knocking] Hey fellahs, can I join?
Number One: Sorry...no Homers.
  Homer G.: Hyuck hyuck.
-- No Homers, plural, already!, "Homer the Great"

% So Homer calls a meeting at the old Stonecutter meeting hall.

    Homer: Loyal Stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the
           Battle of Gettysburg.
            [camera pulls back to reveal scattered, costumed monkeys]
    Marge: [walking in] Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with
           these globus monkeys.  Somebody's going to get parasites.
    Homer: Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club.
    Marge: Oh, Homey.  You know, you _are_ a member of a very exclusive
           club.
    Homer: Black panthers?
    Marge: No, the family Simpson, which has just five members -- and
           only two of those members have special rings.
Bart+Lisa: Yeah!
            [they blow on their whistle rings]
    Marge: I meant our wedding rings!
-- "Homer the Great"

Homer: You know, Marge, you're right.  The Simpson family is the best
       possible club I could belong to.
        [group hug]
        [at home, Bart paddles Homer]
Homer: This club better be worth it!
        [Bart paddles Homer more]
Marge: All right, all right.  It's Lisa's turn.
-- Democracy in the Simpson family club, "Homer the Great"

% Over the credits, the Stonecutter theme song plays.  When the Gracie
% logo appears and the woman says "Shh!", Carl's voice says, "Shut up!"
