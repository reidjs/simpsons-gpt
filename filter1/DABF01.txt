Nader:		[raises his hand] Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!
Burns:		You've already done enough, Nader.
Krusty:		Let's get rid of PBS!  Those lousy Muppets have been 
		taking food out of my mouth for too long.  Humph!
Dracula:	I say we crack down on the hippies.  Blah!
Tex:		What about this dang environment?  Back in Texas, we 
		got rid of it, and made everyone a lot happier.
		[the other Republicans murmur their assent]
Burns:		Excellent!  We shall destroy the environment by 
		scrapping every anti-pollution law.  Now, Bob Dole

% Industry immediately takes advantage of the lax pollution laws.  The
% smokestack of steel mill sends a column on thick black smoke into
% the sky.  The smoke factory next door does the same thing.  So does
% a nearby day care center.  The pollution produces acid rain so

	[collapses on the ground, as his overalls dissolve]
	It burns like a Glasgow bikini wax!
-- Which explains why Scots are so hairy, "Brawl in the Family"

% Marge looks out the window and figures the family should stay
% inside, "at least until the squirrels stop melting."  That's okay
% with Homer, who settles on the couch for some TV.  "First Date," a

% The acid rain melts the antenna, cutting off the TV signal.  Homer
% rushes outside to fix the antenna, but is burned by the acid rain. 
% He screams and runs back inside.  When he sees that there's still no
% TV picture Homer screams again, and runs back outside into the rain. 
% The cycle repeats until Marge interrupts him.

Marge:	Stop screaming, Homer.
Homer:	Quit trying to control me.
Marge:	We don't need TV to have family fun.  Why don't we play 
	Monopoly?
Lisa:	[walking to the closet where the board games are kept]
	Which version?  [flips through different versions] We've 
	got "Star Wars" Monopoly, Rasta-Mon-Opoly, Galip-Olopoly

Homer:	They told me it would be like this on the outside.
Lisa:	[picks up one of Bart's "hotels"] These hotels are made of 
	Legos.  Bart, you're cheating!
Marge:	Lisa, it was probably an accident.
Lisa:	Oh, sure, you take his side, just because he bought you 
	that house on St. James Place.
Bart:	Who else is going to take care of her?  Dad?
Homer:	Why, you little ... [throttles Bart]
Marge:	Stop fighting!  [throttles Homer]
Lisa:	Mom, that's not how you pry them apart!  [grabs Bart's arm 
	and tries to pull him away from Homer]
Marge:	I've been prying them apart since before you were born!
-- Family game night at the Simpsons, "Brawl in the Family"

% Maggie grows concerned about the family's brawling.  She crawls to

	[four men turn left, but the fifth turns right.  They bump

-- Well, it beats Brown, "Brawl in the Family"

% As if on cue, a choral note, like the one that opens the "Simpsons"
% theme song, plays.  A man in a natty white suit approaches the
% family's cell.

Gabriel:	Hello, I'm Gabriel.
Homer:		[gasps] A heavenly choir!  You must be an angel.
Gabriel:	[laughs] No, that's my pager.  [turns it off]  I'm a 
		social worker.  I'm here to help you stop fighting, 
		and become a family again.
Homer:		No, you are an angel, like Denzel Washington in "The 
		Preacher's Wife," or Will Smith in "Bagger Vance," 
		or Slimer in "Ghostbusters."
Marge:		Sir, we know you're not an angel.  My husband sees 
		too many movies.
Homer:		Don't blame me -- blame Tinseltown and its second 
		golden age.  May it never end.
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Before family therapy begins in earnest, Gabriel does some field
% work, observing each family member in his or her own habitat.  He
% starts with Lisa.  Sitting at her desk, she declares that her room
% is her sanctuary, and that her family respects this.  Just then
% Bart, who has just been sprayed by a skunk, runs into her closet and
% uses some of her sweaters to clean himself up.  Lisa uses an
% executive stress ball and chants a mantra -- "Just ten more years"
% -- to keep her anger under control.
%
% Bart's next.  Some kids might be embarrassed to be trailed by a
% therapist.  Not, Bart, though.

Bart:		Attention, everyone!  This is Gabriel, my personal 
		social worker.  He has to be here -- I'm just that 
		nuts.
		[the schoolyard kids are impressed]
Milhouse:	How come you get a social worker?  I'm the one with 
		stigmata.  [holds up his bloody hands]
-- You get a part in Mel Gibson's next movie, "Brawl in the Family"

% By contrast, Marge seems to be the picture of sanity.  Gabriel eats
% a home-baked brownie.

Gabriel:	Thank you Marge.  You sure do love cooking.
Marge:		Food keeps my family happy, so I make a few practice 
		dinners before showtime.  'Cause at six o'clock, we 
		go live!
		[Gabriel looks disturbed]
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Gabriel observes Homer in his favorite place -- Moe's Tavern.

Homer:		Okay, Gabriel, this is a bar.  It's where I go to 
		drink alcohol, which is the mortal equivalent of 
		your ambrosia.
Gabriel:	Homer, I am not an angel.
Homer:		Pfft.  Well not with that temper.
		[seven beers later]
		Look, the think about my family is, there's five of 
		us:  Marge, Bart, Girl Bart, the one who doesn't 
		talk, and the fat guy.  How I loathe him.  [falls 
		off the barstool, and groans.  Gabriel jots 
		something down in his notebook, and shakes his head]
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Now that Gabriel has appraised the situation, he's able to think of
% a way to help the Simpsons.  He takes the family to a picturesque
% clearing in the woods.

Homer:		Okay, why are we in the woods?  Is this Heaven?
Gabriel:	No, Homer.  I brought you out here to shake off your 
		negative behavior patterns.  Marge, you medicate 
		your family with food.  Bart, you'll do anything for 
		attention -- cut that out!
		[cut to Bart, who is wearing a beard of bees]
Bart:		They chose me.
		[back to Gabriel]
Gabriel:	Homer, your problem is quite simple.  You're a 
		drunken, childish buffoon.
Homer:		Which is society's fault because ...
Gabriel:	It's your fault, Homer, but I've got an exercise 
		that will help all of you break out of the roles 
		you're stuck in.  Who feels like lunch?
Lisa:		Me!
Homer:		     Me!
Bart:		          Right here!
Marge:		                       Me too!
Gabriel:	Good.  I hung it at the top of that tree.  [points 
		up.  A backpack hangs from one of the top limbs of a 
		tall pine tree]
Bart:		But how are we supposed to get it?
Gabriel:	You'll just have to cooperate.
Homer:		Cooperate?  Well, this is one family that doesn't 
		swing that way.
Gabriel:	Are you sure?  I made roast beef sandwiches -- one 
		falafel --
Lisa:		Thank you.
Gabriel:	And plenty of beer.
Homer:		Give me that beer!
-- It's all in the motivation, "Brawl in the Family"

% When it comes to beer, Homer can be a downright ingenious thinker. 
% Rather than taking the obvious route of climbing to the picnic
% basket, Homer gets in the car and rams the tree.  It falls over,
% just barely missing Gabriel.  (He may not be an angel, but evidently
% they are watching over him.)  The tree slides toward a canyon,
% hooking Gabriel in its branches and dragging him over the edge.
%
% The tree bounces off the sides of the canyon a few times, before it
% becomes wedged horizontally between the two canyon walls.  Gabriel
% holds on to one of the branches, which is the only thing preventing
% him from falling hundreds of feet to the canyon floor.  He's unhurt
% -- for the moment -- but the scent of the lunch has attracted a pack
% of wolves and cougars, who gather underneath the tree.

Marge:	We've got to do something -- but what?
Homer:	Okay, family huddle.
	[the family huddles together.  Homer lowers his voice to a 
	whisper]
	Now, here's how it's going down.  As a family, we drive 
	away.  We cover for each other, as a family.  It's what 
	Gabriel would have wanted.
Lisa:	Look, we can't fall into old patterns.  We've got to think 
	of a plan.
Homer:	Okay, but talk like this.
Lisa:	[whisper] Fine, I'll talk like this.
Homer:	[normal voice] What?
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% As a family, the Simpsons devise a rescue plan.  As the rest of the
% family steadies his descent, Homer climbs down the canyon wall and
% onto the tree.  He has to move quickly, for the wolves and cougars
% have formed their own plan-making huddle.

Lisa:	Dad's on the log.  Now Mom, you get the car and pull them 
	to safety.
	[Marge runs toward the car, but trips on a tree root]
Marge:	Oh, my driving ankle!  Bart, I know this sounds crazy, but 
	do you think you can drive a car?
Bart:	[innocently] Okay, but it's my first time.
Marge:	Here's the keys.  [hands him the keys]
Bart:	I got a set.  [walks to the car and laces up a pair of 
	driving gloves]
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Bart expertly backs the car to the edge of the cliff.  Lisa ties the
% rope to the bumper, and Bart slowly drives forward, hauling up Homer
% and Gabriel.  The two men aren't out of danger yet, though.  The
% wolves and cougars know the value of teamwork, too.  They form a
% sort of "totem pole" by climbing onto one another.  Soon, they're
% close enough to swipe at Homer and Gabriel.  The social worker tells
% Homer to throw the food at the animals to distract them.

Homer:		Oh, no!  The roast beef is making them stronger -- 
		and the falafel is making them angrier!
		[the animals rig a catapult-like device, and use it 
		to launch a cougar towards the men]
Gabriel:	Give them the beer!  It will impair their motor 
		skills.
Homer:		No!  I will never -- [looks at the beer] Oh, wait, 
		it's Blatz.  [tosses it to the animals]
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% The animals bite into the cans, drink the beer, and immediately get
% wasted.
%
% With everyone safe, the family and Gabriel head home, singing
% happily.

All:	[singing to the tune of "We Are Family"]
	We are family!
Bart:	Our bitter fights are now history!
All:	We are family!
Homer:	Wolves and cougars ate our roast beef!
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Gabriel is really satisfied with the way the Simpsons have come
% together as a family.  He has truly earned his Wings ... CD.  As he
% listens to "Band on the Run," Marge reflects on how the trip to the
% woods has affected her family.

Marge:	You know, we've been through some 280 adventures together, 
	but our bond has never been stronger.
Homer:	Yep, our family is as functional as all get-out.
Lisa:	Could this be the end of our series ... of events?
-- Tonight, on self-reference theater ... "Brawl in the Family"

% The family bond is soon tested.  As they pull up to the house, two
% women are waiting in the driveway.  They are Amber and Ginger, the
% two floozies that Homer and Ned unwittingly married during their
% trip to Las Vegas.

Marge:		Can I help you?
Amber:		Yeah, I'm looking for Homer Simpson.
Homer:		Oh, it's the woman I married in Vegas!
		[everyone in the car gasps]
Gabriel:	Homer, you're a bad man, and your seed should be 
		wiped from the earth.  [to Bart and Lisa] No 
		offense, children.

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:25]

% Homer tells Marge that while he did marry Amber, he also abandoned
% her.  Strangely, Marge is not mollified.

Ned:	Oh, we've got a real shower upstairs.
Ginger:	Upstairs?  I hit the jackpot!

Marge:	Get out, Homer.
Homer:	Look, I married her, but that is as far as we went.  We

Marge:	Homer, I don't know if I can ever forgive you.  Please go

Homer:	Fair enough, but I'm going to come back with the greatest 
	gift a husband can give his wife:  An annulment from his 
	secret wife.
-- When diamonds don't quite say it, "Brawl in the Family"

% That's easier said than done, as Homer finds out in Judge Harm's

% Marge kicks Homer out of the house, in spite of his protests that

% residence in Bart's treehouse.  Amber climbs up, bringing with her
% the makings for a pretty good midnight snack.
