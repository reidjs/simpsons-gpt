% Homer's watching TV.  That's not unusual, but his choice of 
% programming is.

Bart:	You're watching PBS?
Homer:	Hey, I'm as surprised as you, but I stumbled across the 
	most delicious British sitcom.
	[the title of the show appears on the screen]
Bart:	[reading it] "Do Shut Up"?
Homer:	It's about a hard-drinking yet loving family of soccer 
	hooligans.  If they're not having a go with the birds, 
	they're having a row with the wankers.
Bart:	Cheeky.
-- "Missionary: Impossible"

% On screen, Eighties punk music plays as two brothers celebrate 
% Christmas, hooligan-style.

Brother 1:	Jolly sodding X-mas, major.  [presents a bottle of 
		beer] Choke on it!  [whacks the other man over the 
		head with it.  Bart and Homer laugh]
Brother 2:	Oh, crikey!  You gave me a smash on the noggin last 
		year.
		[pulls out a crowbar, and the two begin to fight]
Mum:		[walks into the room with a teapot of water] Not in 
		my parlor, you don't.  [throws the water on them]
Brother 2:	Aw, me eyes!
Brother 1:	Aw, I'm scalded, I am.
Homer:		The mother's the voice of reason.
Bart:		Here come the cricket bats.
		[the two brothers advance on their mother]
Mum:		You don't have the cobbles.
		[suddenly, the show is interrupted by a man wearing 
		a sweater]
Man:		[chuckles] Classic.  Not hard to see why it's 
		England's longest-running series, and today, we're 
		showing all seven episodes.
-- The network wanted eight, but the writing was getting stale,

% Yes, it's that scourge of public-television enthusiasts everywhere:  
% The pledge drive.  Bart groans with frustration.  Today, actress 
% Betty White helps beg the viewers for money.

If you watch even one second of PBS and don't contribute, you're a 
thief.  A common thief!
-- Betty White, "Missionary: Impossible"

% To entice viewer generosity, the two describe the thank-you gifts 
% the network offers.

Man:	With your donation, you'll receive this classic PBS tote 
	bag.  [holds it up]
White:	Or this umbrella -- [opens it] featuring a picture of our 
	classic tote bag.
Man:	[holds up a CD] And the next twenty callers will get this 
	album of museum noises.  Now your music room can sound 
	just like the Metropolitan Museum in New York.
	[we hear footsteps echo through a quiet hall, then a 
	cough]
	Outstanding.
Homer:	Why are you torturing me?  I'm just a man!
-- "Missionary: Impossible"

% Ms. White claims that only US$10,000 more is needed before the 
% conclusion of "Do Shut Up" can roll.  Eager to get things moving as 
% quickly as possible, Homer dials the PBS pledge number and promises 
% the entire ten grand -- anonymously.

Bart:	Dad, you don't have ten thousand dollars.
Homer:	Eh.  How are they going to find me?
	[at PBS Pledge Central, the "mercury" in a thermometer 
	display rises all the way to the top and rings a bell]
White:	Folks, we've just reached our goal of ten thousand, seven 
	hundred dollars, and it's all thanks to one generous 
	caller ... who didn't leave his name.
Homer:	[laughs]
White:	But thanks to Insta-Trace, we've learned it's Homer 
	Simpson, of 742 Evergreen Terrace.  [a picture of Homer 
	appears on the screen.  He screams]
Homer:	Oh, why did I register with Insta-Trace?
-- For the Insta-Trace tote bag?  "Missionary: Impossible"

% There's no time for regret now with the PBS Pledge Enforcement Van 
% on its way.  Bart beats a hasty retreat to the back yard, where he 
% plays on the swing set.
%
% As promised, the van swiftly arrives, carrying a complete TV crew 
% and various other hangers-on.  Homer answers their knock, and the 
% pledge drive man hails him as, "the man who saved PBS."  Meanwhile, 
% in a store where Marge and Lisa are shopping, a wall of TVs shows 
% the scene.

Lisa:	Mom, Dad's on PBS!
Marge:	Hmm?  They don't show police chases, do they?
Homer:	[on TV] Um, it's an honor to give ten thousand dollars.  
	Especially now, when the rich mosaic of cable programming 
	has made public television so very, very unnecessary.
	[the crowd claps]
Marge:	From now on, one of us always stays home.
Lisa:	Agreed.

% Homer offers to write a check later, when the banks open.  Betty 
% White points out that it's only 12:15 (and a weekday, presumably).  
% Insisting that they'll probably be closed, Homer agrees to head to 
% the bank anyway.
%
% At the bank, Homer peers through the window at the activity within.  
% People are walking in and out, doing business with the tellers and 
% talking with the loan officers, but Homer still tries feigning that 
% the bank is closed.  The PBS people, perhaps because the watch a lot 
% of educational television, are too smart to fall for this.

Homer:	I'd like to withdraw ten thousand dollars, please.  [hands 
	teller a slip of paper and winks]
Teller:	[reading the paper] "You are on television, please play 
	along."  Are you robbing me?
Homer:	[aside to teller] I'll pay you later.
Man:	Um, is there a problem, Mr. Simpson?
Homer:	Uh, why, no, everything is just --
	[grabs a pen and tries to stab the PBS man in the chest.  
	The pen is chained to the desk, and the chain is too short 
	to reach its target.  Homer finally breaks down]
	Oh, I can't do it, I can't kill a man!
	[regains his composure, and tries stabbing the man in the 
	groin]

% Betty White finally gets Homer to confess that he doesn't have the 
% money.  Then, she sics the hooligans from "Do Shut Up" on him.  
% Homer flees from the bank, and what seems like the entire lineup of 
% PBS gives chase.

It's a beautiful day to kick your ass!
-- Fred Rogers, showing his darker side, "Missionary: Impossible"

% Yo Yo Ma, the cellist, uses his instrument to bows at Homer.  The 
% Teletubbies use their antennae to zap Homer with powerful laser 
% beams.  Homer tries to evade them by running down an alley.  
% Suddenly, Big Bird swoops down from the sky.  Looking for a way out, 
% Homer spots the First Church of Springfield.  He runs in and bars 
% the door with a collection basket, claiming sanctuary all the while.  
% Reverend Lovejoy regrets teaching Homer what the word "sanctuary" 
% means.
%
% The PBS crowd closes in.  A garbage can sails through one of the 
% stained-glass windows.  Oscar the Grouch and Elmo the Overhyped Toy 
% pop out and demand the money.  Homer promises Lovejoy he'll do 
% anything, and the two men make their escape.  Outside the church, 
% Lovejoy's car is surrounded by the angry mob.  "Nothing to see here, 
% people," he assures them, "just heading down to the dump with these 
% children's letters to God."  He pats a letter bag, in which Homer is 
% hiding.
%
% The mob is fooled, and lets Lovejoy pass.  Next, he puts Homer on 
% board a cargo plane.

Lovejoy:	We'll send you someplace safe 'til the heat dies 
		down.
Homer:		Great, but why am I on a plane?
Lovejoy:	Homer, how would you like to be a missionary in the 
		South Pacific?
Homer:		South Pacific?  I didn't agree to --
		[Lovejoy shuts the door on him, and taxis down the 
		runway.  Homer gets out of his seat and runs to the 
		cockpit]
		Wait, I'm no missionary!  I don't even believe in 
		Jebus!  Let me out.
Pilot:		Sorry, no can do.
		[Homer runs to the door and pounds on it.  Cut to a 
		shot outside one of the door window]
Homer:		Oh, save me Jebus!

%
% Back in Springfield, Lovejoy enjoys some of Mrs. Simpson's pie.  
% After some time, he finally gets around to breaking the news that 
% her husband is twelve thousand miles away, in Microatia.  He gives 
% the family a ham radio, on which we can hear Homer desperately 
% calling for Jebus.
%
% Once Homer gets to the island, things don't look so bad.  A colorful 
% butterfly even alights on his arm.  Then it suddenly curls up its 
% wings and burrows into Homer's arm.  The little bulge of the bug 
% under Homer's skin allows him to trace its route through his body, 
% until it arrives at his brain.  (Where, at least, it can't do much 
% damage.)
%
% The islands outgoing missionaries are a young couple dressed in a 
% "Banana Republic" kind of way.

Craig:	Welcome aboard, brother!  You must be Homer.  I'm Craig 
	[indicates] that's Amy.  Well, see ya!  [get on board the 
	plane]
Homer:	You're leaving?  Wait!  What do I do here?
Amy:	First of all, forget everything you learned in missionary 
	school.
Homer:	[pause] Done.
Craig:	We taught them some English and ridiculed away most of 
	their beliefs.
Amy:	So, you can take it from there.  'Bye!
Craig:	Don't let the bedbugs bite!  [closes plane door]
	[opens the door] Seriously.  [closes plane door]
-- Welcome wagon, "Missionary: Impossible"

% The plane takes off, leaving Homer to introduce himself to the 
% natives.

Homer:		Me Homer.  Me hiding from PBS.
Q'Toktok:	I am Q'Toktok, and this is Ak.  [Ak kisses Homer's 
		hand]
Ak:		Welcome Reverend Homer.  We look forward to learning 
		about the Bible from you.
Homer:		[reaches into a trunk and retrieves two bibles.  He 
		hands these to Q'Toktok and Ak] Here you go.  Knock 
		yourself out.
Q'Toktok:	We cannot read.
Homer:		Oh, does the word "jet lag" mean anything to you 
		people?  [slowly] Jet ... lag?
-- "Missionary: Impossible"

% Later, Q'Toktok, Ak, and Homer stroll around the island.  Homer is 
% drinking from a fuzzy brown object with a straw in it.

Q'Toktok:	Are you enjoying your ox testicle?
Homer:		Oh, yes -- very much so.
Q'Toktok:	Really?  You sure you wouldn't rather have a 
		coconut?  [chuckles] They're delicious.
Homer:		No, I'm good.  [slurps happily.  Q'Toktok and Ak 
		look at each other and shrug]
		[Homer sees two attractive sarong-wearing women walk 
		by]
		Hey, what happened to all the shirtless girls you 
		see in all the geographical magazines?
Q'Toktok:	Craig and Amy gave us the gift of shame.  All the 
		naked women are on that island.  [points to a 
		distant island]
Ak:		Yeah, anything goes over there.  Bouncy, bouncy!
Homer:		Aw.
		[the ground shakes]
		[startled] What was that?
Q'Toktok:	Oh.  We call that [makes gagging noise] ... sorry, 
		fishbone in my throat.  [plucks bone out of his 
		mouth, and tosses it away]  We call that, 
		"earthquake."
Homer:		Great.  Now my testicle's got ants on it.

		dropped.  The ants have indeed gotten to it]
-- "Missionary: Impossible"

% Homer meets Oovilu-Eeoo-Kitana-Wanjay, a little girl who looks (and 
% sounds) like an Island version of Lisa.  Homer bestows upon her a 
% copy of the Bible, and the more manageable name of "Lisa, Jr."  Then 
% he asks Q'Toktok and Ak what the islanders do for fun.  They answer 
% with a list of Craig and Amy's civic projects.  "Craig and Amy, 
% Craig and Amy," says Homer, irritated.  "Why don't you just marry 
% Craig and Amy?"  The two island leaders, in fact, regret missing 
% their chance to do so.

Homer:		Oh, how's the TV reception here?  Excellent, or ...
Q'Toktok:	[wondering] Tee ... vee?
Homer:		You don't have TV?  But what will I watch when I'm 
		sitting on the couch?
Ak:		[slowly] Couch?
Homer:		No couches either?  Oh, man, I need a beer.
		[Q'Toktok and Ak just stare at each other]
		[Homer collapses to the ground]
		Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!

		God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!
-- ... not a single luxury ... "Missionary: Impossible"

% As a substitute for beer, Homer tries licking the island's toads for 
% their intoxicating effects.  It takes a few false starts before 
% Homer finds one that does the trick.  "Homer, Homer ..." one of he 
% animals appears to call to him, "hello, Homer.  Is there anybody in 
% there?"  But the voice turns out to be Marge, calling on the ham 
% radio.

Marge:	Homer, are you all right?
Homer:	I guess so, but that first month was pretty rough.
Marge:	You've only been gone two days.
Homer:	Really?  Without TV, it's hard to know when one day begins 
	and the other ends.
Bart:	I miss you, Dad.  Mom won't let me read "Hagar the 
	Horrible."
Marge:	I just don't think it's funny.
Homer:	Hmm, I can see the house is falling apart without me, so 
	here's the new order:  Bart, you're the man of the house.  
	Lisa, I'm promoting you to boy.  Maggie's now the brainy 
	girl.  The toaster can fill in for Maggie.  And Marge, 
	you're a consultant.
Marge:	[disappointed] Ohh ...
Lisa:	Dad?
Homer:	Yes, boy?
Lisa:	I just want to tell you how proud I am that you're showing 
	an interest in your fellow man.
Homer:	Really?  You're proud of me?
Marge:	Oh, yes.  The whole town thinks you're a real 
	humanitarian.  Ned Flanders is green with envy.
Homer:	Oh, really?  Well, if you'll excuse me, I've got some 
	civilization to spread like butter on the English muffin 
	that is these people, with all their little nooks and

Bart:	Dad, are you licking toads?
Homer:	I'm not *not* licking toads.  Well, it's time to get to

-- Birth of a philanthropist, "Missionary: Impossible"

% Homer tries to spread God's word by reading from the book of "Puh-
% salms," and tries to answer the islanders' to questions about 
% religion.

Lisa, Jr.:	Amy said that there are lots of religions.  Which is 
		the right one?
Homer:		Well, not the Unitarians.  If that's the one true 
		faith, I'll eat my hat.
Ak:		If the Lord is all-powerful, why does He care 
		whether we worship Him or not?  Ak just saying.
Homer:		Well, Ak, it's because God is powerful, but also 
		insecure, like Barbara Streisand before James 
Brolin.  	Oh, he's been a rock.
-- The Gospel according to Homer, "Missionary: Impossible"

% Homer soon realizes he's in over his head, and confesses that he's 
% not really a missionary.  He tells the islanders that what they need 
% is something with a little razzle-dazzle.
%
% The natives and Homer begin an elaborate project.  Homer tries using 
% a pelican as a living cement mixer, as on "The Flintstones," but 
% that trick doesn't work in Microatia.
%
% Meanwhile, Bart settles into his now position as man of the house.  
% He pulls into work on is skateboard, sits at Homer's workstation 
% (replacing Marge's photo with one of Krusty) and starts the day's 
% work.  Before he can get going, though, Mr. Burns storms into the 
% room.

Burns:	Simpson!
Bart:	Aah!
Burns:	I've just reviewed your ten-year performance record, and 
	it's appalling.
Bart:	But I'm not Homer Simpson.
Burns:	I think I know who Homer Simpson is.  [leafing through a 
	thick report] In ten short years, you've caused seventeen 
	meltdowns.  One is too many!
Bart:	Yeah, but ...
Burns:	You sold weapons-grade plutonium to the Iraqis -- with no 
	markup!
Bart:	I ...
Burns:	And worst of all, you took the Hamburgler's birthday off 
	last Monday *and* Wednesday.  [throws down report] Which 
	is it?  Now my voice is giving out, so I'm just going to 
	poke you for the next hour or so.  [repeatedly pokes Bart 
	with a long stick.  Bart groans resignedly]
-- Man of the house isn't such a hot position after all, "Missionary:

% At last, Homer's project is complete.  It's something that has 
% revitalized cities back home, and Homer is confident that it can do 
% the same here.  It's ... the Lucky Savage, Microatia's new casino, 
% featuring Island versions of blackjack, craps, Texas Hold 'Em, and 
% roulette.  (Betting on roulette is extra-challenging here, since the 
% "ball" can walk under its own power to any number.)  For 
% refreshments, there's a bar that serves a mixture of Dristan and 
% holy water.

So have fun, everybody!  And who knows, maybe you'll hit the jackpot, 
get off this island, and spend the rest of your days in a tropical 
paradise.
-- Homer Simpson, "Missionary: Impossible"

% The islanders immediately begin gaming.  When Marge hears the news, 
% she's impressed, and Homer says he knows how casino entrepreneur Bob 
% Stupak feels.  The feeling doesn't last long, however.  The next 
% day, Homer arrives at the casino to see that the place is trashed, 
% and that a massive fight has broken out.  Ak, drunk, accosts Homer.

% attend church to avoid Hell.  He isn't happy to learn it's an every-
% Sunday thing.
%
% The chapel's iron bell tolls, calling the faithful.  Homer tells 
% Lisa Jr., who is doing the ringing, that since God is "way up on the 
% Moon," they'll have to ring louder.  Grabbing hold of the bell-rope, 
% Homer pulls with all his might and proclaims that he's doing the 
% Lord's work.
%
% Then did God smite the island and all who dwell within.  The ringing 
% of the bell starts an avalanche, which sets the ground to shaking.  
% Suddenly, the earth cleaves in two and lava flows across the island.  
% The chapel stands briefly on an island of its own, in the middle of
