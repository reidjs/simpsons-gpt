%
% The next morning, Marge walks through the kitchen, remarking to

% she figures out the source of the optical distortion:  a gas leak. 
% It's probably coming from the makeshift hose line running from
% behind the stove, out the window, across the back yard, and to
% Homer's Tiki idol.  The gas fuels a lighter in the idol's mouth. 
% Homer stand's behind the Tiki, trying to impress Bart and Lisa, who

%
% Suitably refreshed, Homer takes Barney to an AA meeting.

Barney:	My name is Barney, and I'm an alcoholic.

Clerk:	East St. Louis?
Homer:	Is there any other St. Louis?
-- Possibly, "Days of Wine and D'oh'ses"

% Homer finds the right meeting place, at the First Church of

Kirk:		Ah, welcome back, Homer.  I see you've finally hit 
		rock bottom.
Homer:		Pffft.  Not a chance!  I can sink way lower.  I just 
		came to help my friend Barney.
Lindsey:	We all know why we're here, don't we?  To keep 
		ourselves sober ... and to network.  So let's get 
		started.
Gil:		Well, after I lost my third job in two days, old Gil 
		was in a pit of despair.
Lindsey:	And that's when you realized you were an alcoholic?
Gil:		Oh, no, I never touch the stuff.  But you don't have 
		to be drunk to know the value of Amway.  [the AA 
		members gasp, and Gil holds up a small jar]  Now, 
		this is used crankcase oil, [spills it on the floor] 
		which you ladies know is murder to clean up, you 
		know.  And company's coming -- [two men pick up Gil 
		and carry him out the door] Aw, you're doing this at

% Bart and Lisa rummage through a closet containing memorabilia from

Barney:	Great singer, though.
Pilot:	Oh, absolutely.  You know who else I like is that, uh, Leo 
	Sayer.  Anyway, we're nice and level now.  How would you 
	like to take the controls?
Barney:	You think I'm ready?
Pilot:	Sure, I do.  One sec -- [leans toward a microphone] 
	Testing!  Black box!  One, two.  [screams twice]
	[turns to Barney] She's all yours, friend.
Barney:	[nervously grabs the control stick.  The chopper wobbles 
	around, then appears to stabilize]
	Hey, I think I'm gettin' it.
Pilot:	Yes, that's great.  [reassuringly] Now let's just pull 
	ourselves out of this tailspin here.
	[camera pulls back to reveal the helicopter plunging 
	straight toward the ground]
Barney:	[as the helicopter regains control] Oh-h-h, ooh.  Oh, I'm 
	sorry about that.
Pilot:	That's okay; that's what the diapers are for.
-- Same principle as barf bags, "Days of Wine and D'oh'ses"

% The helicopter flies over the Springfield town square, where Lisa
% stands on a ladder and trains her camera on a bird's nest.

Lisa:		Now, when the momma bird returns to feed her babies, 
		we'll have a prize-winning picture.
Bart:		Lisa, people these days don't want to see a baby 
		bird; they want to see celebrities at their worst.
		[just then, Rainier Wolfcastle, looking rather 
		flabby, walks out of the Kwik-E-Mart with a chili

% the whirlybird away from the house.
%
% As Barney demonstrates his newfound skills, Homer catches him up
% with the news.

Homer:	So, you missed some big changes at Moe's.  He hangs

	flying this helicopter?
Pilot:	Power lines!  Power lines!
Barney:	Whoops, sorry.  [pulls up to narrowly miss the power 
	lines, and then resumes normal flight]
	When I think about all the time I wasted at Moe's ...
Homer:	Wasted?  What about our staring contests?  And the way we 
	always knew what football coaches should have done?  
	Remember the day we jumped that census guy and stole his 
	clicker?
Barney:	Those are all priceless memories, Homer, but I don't want
