Marge, can't we get some clear plates?  I can't see the TV!
-- Practical Homer, "A Milhouse Divided"

% Marge wonders aloud if it is necessary to watch TV while they are
% eating, since they are getting food all over.  Just then, a meatball
% falls to the floor, eyed by Maggie, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball
% II.  Each of them tenses, prepared for the kill, when suddenly, Homer
% reaches down and secures it with a fork.  "Yoink!"

 Bart: If you really wanted us to be neater, you'd serve us out of one 
       long bowl.
Marge: You're talking about a _trough_.  We're not going to eat from a 
       trough.  And another thing, it's only 5:15.  Why are you in your 
       underwear?
 Bart: Hey, this ain't the Ritz.

Marge: [off-screen]  Hello, Marge.  How's the family?

Homer: Keep it down in there, everybody!
-- "A Milhouse Divided"

% Later that night, Marge speaks to Homer in bed.

Marge: Homer, is this the way you pictured married life?
Homer: Yeah, pretty much.  Except we drove around in a van solving 
       mysteries.
-- "A Milhouse Divided"

% But Marge pictured a more social life.

Marge: Homer, I want to throw a dinner party.
Homer: [whining] Oh, I hate having parties.  The toilet always gets

Marge: I don't care if the sink shoots sludge.  We're having a party.

% Bart shows Lisa a non-stick wok, into which he drops Maggie.  She
% proves that it is indeed frictionless as she slides inside it, popping
% up on each side.

% In another part of the store, Marge gasps at a huge crystal punchbowl.

Marge: Ooh!  A punchbowl like that just screams good taste.  Wouldn't it
       be perfect for the dinner party.
Homer: Oh, we can't afford that.  Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?
Marge: Well, maybe we could use it once, and then return it.
Homer: Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here.
-- How about the one that Flanders threw away?  "A Milhouse Divided"

         in?
Lovejoy: My coat was stolen at last week's interfaith banquet.  So I 
         helped myself to a few of the better umbrellas.

 Marge: Did anyone see that new Woodsy Allen movie?
   Ned: You know, I like his films except for that nervous fellow that's
        always in them.
-- "A Milhouse Divided"

% But something's not right with the Van Houtens.

Luanne: If you want to talk nervous, you should've seen Kirk deal with

  Kirk: Ha.  Should've asked them to hurl some bacon.  Then maybe I
        could have had a decent breakfast for once.
         [long pause, everyone is uneasy]
 Homer: You know what you two need?  A little comic strip called "Love
        Is..."  It's about two naked eight-year-olds who are married.
         [even longer pause]
-- Not Lisa and Ralph, I hope, "A Milhouse Divided"

% Once everyone's done eating, Julius congratulates Marge on the meal,
% but Kirk can only think about stabbing at Luanne, saying he's never
% eaten that well since he was in the army. Once again, everyone is

%
% After Luanne gets in a quick dig at her husband, Marge loudly suggests

% Next up are the Van Houtens.

 Luanne: Kirk, I don't know what it is.
   Kirk: [sighs] It could not be more simple, Luanne.  You want me to 
         show this to the cat, and have the cat tell you what it is?  
         'Cause the cat's going to get it.
 Luanne: I'm sorry, I'm not as smart as you, Kirk.  We didn't all go to 
         Gudger College.
          [timer dings]
   Kirk: It's dignity!  Gah!  Don't you even know dignity when you see

 Luanne: Kirk, you're spitting.
   Kirk: Okay, genius, why don't _you_ draw dignity.

Homer: Shut up and let the woman talk.
-- Aw, we were getting to the good stuff now, "A Milhouse Divided"

 Luanne: Okay, Kirk, I'll tell a story.  It's about a man whose father-
         in-law gave him a sweet job as manager of a cracker factory.
  Homer: Bo-ring.
 Luanne: A man whose complete lack of business sense and managerial
