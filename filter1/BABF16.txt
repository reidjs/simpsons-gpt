% Bart brings the mail to his dad, earning three dollars for
% convenient on-couch delivery.  The mail brings Homer an interesting
% magazine.

Homer:	Ooh, my first issue of "Self-Test Monthly!"  Finally, I 
	get to find out what makes me tick.
Bart:	I'm betting it's hunger and rage.
Homer:	Yeah, but in what ratio?
-- "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% The cover of "S-TM" poses questions such as, "Are you a good
% driver?"  Homer answers "yes" to all of them, pleased that he's
% testing out so well, until Lisa points out the quizzes are on the
% inside of the magazine.  She suggests that Homer be the quizmaster,
% giving the questions for others to enter.
%
% Homer gets into his new role, wearing a robe and an orange traffic
% cone with a question mark painted on it.  The new quizmaster's first
% subject is Ned Flanders.

Homer:	Okay, Flanders, your love quiz score is ... 61.  That 
	makes you a, "Frigid Frieda."  I took off 30 points for 
	all that crying you did.
Ned:	[sniffs] Well, it was a little insensitive of you giving 
	me a sex test, seeing as my wife just passed away.
Homer:	No way!  When?
Ned:	Six months ago.  You were at the funeral.  You fell into 
	the grave!
Homer:	[laughs] Oh, yeah.  I saw a gopher.  What a day!
-- Not a memorable day, evidently, "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% Homer quizzes his co-workers at the power plant.

Homer:	Okay, last question.  Who is your favorite Back Street 
	Boy?
Lenny:	Oh!  The little rat-faced one.
Carl:	No, no, no -- Nick!  He's so good to his mother.
Homer:	According to this, you're both idiots.
Lenny:	Hey, thanks.  What do we owe you?
-- "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% A quizmaster's job is never done, or so it seems.  Homer tries
% testing Marge as she tries to get some sleep.

Homer:	[reading] Okay, there's a black widow at the door, a 
	rattlesnake in the window, and a scorpion on the phone.  
	Do you:  (A) None of the below, (B) -- 
Marge:	Homey, for God's sakes, it's two a.m.
Homer:	Fine, I'll take the next quiz.  [flips pages, and reads] 
	How long will you live?  In an average week, how many 
	braised ribs do you eat?  Marge, do you think that counts 
	honey braised?
Marge:	[holding a pillow over her head] I don't know!  I'm trying 
	to sleep.
	[dissolve cut to later that night.  Homer polishes off a 
	bucket or ribs as he finishes the test]
Homer:	Okay, non-smoker, add eight years, [adds figures] so 
	according to this I'll live to be ... forty-two?  Ohhh, 
	that's horrible!  I won't even live to see my children 
	die!  [puts his hands to his face and cries]
Marge:	[wakes up] Now what's wrong?
Homer:	I've only got three more years to live.
Marge:	Well, maybe you added it wrong; let me have it.  [takes 
	the magazine, rechecks Homer's math, and recoils in 
	horror]
Homer:	See?  And these quizzes are never wrong, Marge.  They're 
	put together by the finest scientists in the magazine 
	business.
-- Iron-clad credentials, those, "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% Unnerved by the news, and afraid of dying in his sleep, Homer stays
% awake to watch Charlie Rose interview movie producer Robert Evans.

Homer:	Can't sleep -- gonna die.  Can't sleep -- gonna die.
Rose:	We're back with legendary producer Robert Evans.  Now, 
	before you did "The Godfather," there was "Love Story."  
	Tell us about that.
Evans:	Ah, "Love Story" -- the little picture that could.  Was 
	Paramount chomping at the bit to make it?  Heh, heh, you'd 
	better believe they weren't.  But once that tear-jerker 
	hit John Q. Popcorn, it was boffo-boo-boo box office all 
	the way.  [chuckles]
Rose:	And the critics loved it, too.  I remember Vincent Canby 
	said, [turns to the camera] "I'm going to kill you, Homer.  
	You are so dead."
Homer:	[screams]
Rose:	Now "Chinatown" was a classic, but you had problems with 
	the sequel, "The Two Jakes"?
Evans:	Oh, boy.  Disappointed?  I had the blues like Chasen's had 
	chili.  I said to myself, "Evans, you forgot Hollywood 
	Rule #1:  [turns to camera] Kill Homer Simpson."
Homer:	[screams and ducks under a blanket]
	[Marge and the kids walk down the stairs]
Bart:	Hey, what's all the screaming?
Lisa:	Some of us have grammar school in the morning, you know.
Marge:	You should see a doctor, Homey.  A head doctor.
Homer:	I'm not crazy.  It's the TV that's crazy!  [yells at the 
	TV set] Aren't you, TV?
Evans:	The crisis?  Charlie Bludorn's birthday.  The solution?  A 
	snappy banner.  Out comes the phone, in flies Bobby Towne, 
	and six drafts later, I had myself a party.
Homer:	You see?  Gibberish, all gibberish.
-- Hard to argue with that, "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% The next day, an inspection of the power plant goes smoothly --
% until Burns and the inspector run into Homer.  Wearing a children's
% cowboy sleeping bag, he "nurses" a baby doll on the theory that if
% he is a mother, he cannot die.  Burns cannot convince the inspector
% that Homer is just there "to remind the employees of the precious
% gift of sanity," so Homer is sent to the company psychologist.
%
% The shrink figures that Homer's irrational behavior is caused by
% lack of sleep, which in turn springs from Homer's fear of death.

Doctor:	What you need is a good, long rest.  I suggest Florida.
Homer:	Florida?  But that's America's wang!
Doctor:	They prefer, "The Sunshine State."
-- I dunno, I kind of like it, "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% Whatever you chose to call it, Homer and his family are on the way
% to Florida.  Their destination is peaceful Palm Corners, but when
% they get there, they can't help but notice a huge crowd of revelers
% filling the streets.  The town is probably quiet eleven months of
% the year, but the Simpsons have the poor fortune of arriving during
% Spring Break.
%
% The partygoers rush the car, and one well-endowed woman presses her
% breasts up against the passenger's window.  Marge turns to tell
% Homer they will look for someplace more relaxing, but Homer isn't
% there.  He's joined the party, and even helps tip over the car. 
% Through the windshield, Marge can see Homer running off with the
% crowd, yelling, "Party!"
%
% [End of Act One.  Time:  5:48]
%
% Marge surveys the typical Spring Break hijinks -- people running
% half-naked through the streets, playing loud music, drinking, and
% vandalizing signs -- and concludes that Homer will never get the
% rest he needs.  That is, not unless Marge literally straps him to
% the hotel bed.
%
% She underestimated Homer's party-animal nature.  Soon after she
% takes the kids sightseeing, Homer hops out of the hotel, bed and
% all, chanting, "Party!"  He even manages to hitch a ride to the
% beach.
%
% At the beach, MTV hosts its annual Spring Break concert.

Sepulveda:	Whoo!  Sepulveda here, doing the veejay thing for 
		the most out-of-control Spring Break ever.  And 
		since it's my birthday, we'll party extra hard!  [a 
		jewel inset into Sepulveda's palm blinks] Ah!  No!  
		Not yet!  I'm only twenty-five.  [a pair of burly 
		guards drags her away, and a new girl runs to the 
		mike]
Cienega:	What up, chew-toys! {dt}  Cienega here, tightening
		the hose clamps for you bad girls.  We got Kid Rock 
		coming up for all you mosh monkeys.
Homer:		Whoo!  I like music!
-- Then you came to the right place.  Maybe.  "Kill the Alligator
   and Run"

% Kid Rock and crew take the stage.  Homer mistakes Joe C. for a lost
% child and tries to tackle him, but concert security nabs him before
% he can get very far.  Kid Rock begins their set with "Badwitaba,"
% and Homer sings along, off key.
%
% The rest of the family enjoys an airboat tour of the local
% swampland.

Guide:	And if you look to your left, you see another endless 
	stretch of stagnant water.  [some of the tourists take 
	pictures] Oh, well, look who turned out to greet us, 
	folks.  It's our town's most famous resident, Captain 
	Jack.  [a big alligator swims near the airboat]
Lisa:	Look at the size of that gator.
Marge:	Is he a man-eater?
Guide:	Only convicts and hoboes.
Bart:	Do you have any hobo chunks we could throw to him?
Guide:	Ha -- 'fraid not.  Now years ago, Captain Jack helped 
	build Palm Corners by dragging sticks and stones from the 
	swamps.  Legend has it he designed the town flag.  
	[gestures to a tattered flag flying on the airboat's mast]  
	Say hello, Captain Jack.
	[the gator rolls over, showing his belly, and the tourists 
	say, "Aw"]
Marge:	Aw, he can crawl up through my toilet any day.
-- "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% The concert continues.

Kid Rock:	Thank you.  It's the pimp of the nation, Kid Rock, 
		tearing it up at Spring Break, y'all.  Now, what 
		we'd like to do next is bring it down for a minute.
Homer:		[in crowd] Bring on the Rapping Granny!  [the crowd 
		stares at him, incredulous] What?  She's hilarious.
Kid Rock:	You know, a lot of my homies didn't make it to the 
		party, and we're going to give props to the fallen 
		by pouring a forty on the curb.  [some dancing girls 
		wheel a curb onto the stage, and the crowd cheers] 
		But this ain't no forty ounce curb, so we're going 
		to need forty gallons, y'all.  [the crowd cheers 
		wildly, but their cheers turn to boos when Homer 
		grabs the forty-gallon bottle of malt liquor, and 
		begins drinking it]
Homer:		All for Homer.  [drinks] All for Homer.
Kid Rock:	What the?
Joe C.:		Hey, who's that fool?
Kid Rock:	Yo, let's waste that biotch.
Homer:		Biotch?  Moi?  [shakes up the bottle, and sprays Kid 
		Rock and Joe C. with the foam.  They're blasted 
		back, and Homer runs up to the stage microphone]
		[singing badly] We built this city on rock and roll 
		...
		[crowd boos]
		[Homer turns to see a threatening sight.  Two men 
		have grabbed the sleeves of Joe C.'s shirt.  Joe 
		himself has walked toward the back of the stage, 
		stretching the arms of the shirt to such lengths 
		that he looks like a giant slingshot.  Kid Rock 
		exchanges Joe's hat for a German WWI helmet, the 
		kind with a spike on the top]
Kid Rock:	We'll give that punk a Joe C-section.
Joe C.:		Let's do this thing.
Sheriff:	[walks onstage] All right now, boys, that's enough.  
		[The men let go of the sleeves] Kid Rock, that's not 
		like you.  And Joe C., would your mama want you 
		stretching out that sweatshirt like that?
Joe C.:		No, sir.  Please don't tell mama.
Homer:		They called you a pig, sheriff.
Sheriff:	Well, I don't care what they call me, as long as 
		they play "Fists of Rage."  That's a good song.  
		[chuckles]
-- "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% Marge paces nervously in the hotel room.  The sheriff comes by with
% Homer, who is still quite drunk.  "Guess how many boobs I saw today,
% Marge," he asks, before answering, "Fifteen!"  With that, Homer
% passes out on the couch.  The sheriff laughs good-naturedly and
% figures Homer was just blowing off steam.
%
% Homer wakes up the next morning to find that his insomnia is gone,
% and that his mental health (such as it was) has returned.  He goes
% out for more Spring Break fun, but the party is over and the
% students are getting ready to return to campus.  Homer vows to party
% on.
%
% The family charters an airboat, and roars through the swamp, playing
% "Louie, Louie."  Homer's having a good time, but the rest of the
% family is clearly counting the minutes before they return to dry
% land.

Homer:	[singing] We built this city, this kick-ass city,
	What kind of music built this city?  [pantomimes holding a 
	microphone to Lisa]
Lisa:	[singing, dispirited] Rock and roll.
Bart:	Dad, look out!
Homer:	[singing] Look out for what?
Bart:	[singing] The giant gator!
Homer:	[singing] The giant -- aah!
-- "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% The imperiled alligator is Captain Jack.  There isn't enough time
% for him to get out of the way, and the airboat scores a direct hit
% on him.  He floats upside-down, apparently on his way to gator
% Heaven.
%
% Just then, a police airboat pulls alongside the Simpsons, and the
% sheriff says that Homer is deep in trouble now.  Homer tries to make
% a break for it, but the swamp critters persuade him to go along
% quietly.
%
% The family returns in handcuffs to the police station.

Marge:		Did you really have to handcuff the children?
Sheriff:	No, ma'am, I did not.
Marge:		You seemed so understanding before.  What happened 
		to, "boys will be boys"?
Sheriff:	You see, during Spring Break, the beer companies pay 
		me to look the other way.  The rest of the year, I'm 
		a real hard-ass.
-- Now he tells us, "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% The standard-issue handcuffs don't fit Maggie, so the sheriff goes
% into the station to get a smaller pair.  Homer sees a set of keys
% hanging on a nail, and a chance for freedom.  He reaches toward
% them, and then uses the nail to split the chain holding his cuffs
% together.  The family runs to their car, and they speed off.
%
% The sheriff gives chase.  Using a bullhorn, he tells Homer to pull
% over, but Homer isn't going down without a fight.  Up ahead, there's
% a railroad crossing, and the lowered crossing bars indicate a train
% is coming through.  Homer gets an idea.

Marge:	Homer, no!  You'll kill us all.
Homer:	Or die trying!
-- That's the spirit, "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% Homer guns it, and the family makes it across the tracks, just
% before the train reaches the intersection.  The sheriff is trapped
% on the other side.  The Simpsons get a few moments relief, but they
% have stopped on another set of tracks, just beyond the first.  Sure
% enough, a train headed in the other direction plows right into them,
% and carries them down the track.  Inside the car, Lisa asks her
% father what to do now.  Homer makes the most of the situation, and
% goes to sleep behind the wheel.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:28]
%
% Dawn breaks, and the train is still pushing the car down the track. 
% Lisa wakes up to find that Homer is missing.  Soon, he climbs in
% through the side window, having just visited the snack car.  He says
% he spoke with the engineer, and received his assurance that there's
% a procedure for just this sort of situation.
%
% The procedure is to pry the car off the train so it can roll down
% the hill.  It comes to a rest after flipping over several times. 
% The family gets out, and Homer puts out his shirt, which caught fire
% as the car was rolling.

Marge:	This family has hit a new low.  We're on the run from the 
	law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes, and 
	it's all your fault.  [points to Homer]
Homer:	I love being married.
-- "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% The family trudges down a back road until the reach a diner, which
% has some "help wanted" signs in the window.  Homer figures they can
% hide there until the heat's off.  The Simpsons walk into the diner,
% each one taking a sign as they enter.

Velma:	You took the signs out of the window?  That's pretty 
	presumptuous.  How do you know I'm going to hire you?
Bart:	Sorry, I just want to be a broom boy so bad.
Velma:	I like your attitude.  You're hired.  [to Lisa] How 'bout 
	you, missy?  You want to be a mop girl?
Lisa:	Not really, no.
Velma:	I like your honesty.  You're hired.  [to Marge and Homer] 
	And you two haven't said a word.  I like that -- you're 
	hired.
Homer:	Woo Hoo!
Velma:	Hey, keep it down!
-- She doesn't like that, "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% The jobs come with some fringe benefits, like lodging.

Velma:	Y'all can stay in this trailer.  Now, it ain't Buckingham 
	Palace --
Homer:	[disappointed groan]
Velma:	-- but I raised eight young'uns, three chillun's, and a 
	baby here.  [opens the door.  The trailer is in really bad 
	shape]
Lisa:	Ew.
Marge:	Oh, it's so cozy.
Velma:	You're insincere.  I like that.
-- "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% The Simpsons start work at the diner.  Music plays on a radio in the
% background, until the DJ announces that authorities are on the
% lookout for a family of fugitives.  Velma quickly realizes the
% Simpsons are those fugitives, but figures they can stay, even when
% she catches Homer about to knock her out with a frying pan.
%
% Safe for now, the family members settle into their new lives.

Homer:	Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
	Jimmy crack corn and I'm not there
	We built this city on rock and r-o-o-o-ll
	Something, something, day.
Lisa:	Wow, look at all the stars you can see here.
Marge:	Those noxious gasses from the swamp must magnify them.
Bart:	I'm getting used to this country life.  Teacher says I'm 
	whittling at a tenth-grade level.
Marge:	And y'all hardly ever bicker any more.
Lisa:	Too hot to bicker, I reckon.
Homer:	You know, killing that gator was the best decision I ever 
	made.
Bart:	Got that right.
Marge:	Dern tootin'
Lisa:	Boy, howdy.
Homer:	Yep, this place is great.  And some day, when Lisa and 
	Bart get married, it'll all be theirs.
Bart +
  Lisa:	Yuck!
Marge:	You mean when they marry other people.
Homer:	Okay, but I ain't paying for two weddin's.
-- "Kill the Alligator and Run"

% That night, the family is awakened when their trailer starts moving. 
% The long arm of the law has finally caught up to them.  The sheriff
% hitches his cruiser to the trailer, and drives the family to jail. 
% Velma looks on, declaring (you guessed it), "I like that."
%
% Homer represents himself at the trial.  He opens his defense by
% saying, "Drunken hicks of the jury ..."
%
% The next thing they know, the Simpsons are on a chain gang, busting
% up rocks.  The work is hard, and the gang boss whips his prisoners
% at the slightest provocation.

Marge:		We'd be much better rock-breakers if we weren't all 
		chained together.  [gets whipped]
Boss:		No talking.
Marge:		You know, you catch more flies with honey than with 
		vinegar.  [gets whipped again] Ow!  I'm beginning to 
		dislike the man with the whip.
		[the sheriff drives up in his car]
Sheriff:	Afternoon, folks.  Got a new assignment for you.  
		The judge is having a little soirée and he needs 
		some help.
		[Homer gets whipped]
Boss:		No listening.  You hear me?
Homer:		Uh, no.
Boss:		You just don't learn, do you?  [whips Homer]
Homer:		Ow!

% The judge's party that night has a unique Florida ambiance. 
% Socialites from the town gather around a buffet table, upon which
% has been placed an ice sculpture of Old Sparky, Florida's electric
% chair (now retired).  The Simpsons, still dressed in their festive
% orange prison jumpsuits, tend to the guests by offering hors
% d'oeuvres.  The gang boss is there, keeping the prisoners in line
% with his whip.

% Marge concocts a plan to escape.  She directs Bart to get the

		grab his keys.  [Bart winks and walks off]
Lisa:		What should I do?
Marge:		Restock the possum bar.  We're almost out of claws.
Lisa:		[disappointed] Ohh.  [walks offscreen]
		[the sheriff walks up to the punch bowl]
Marge:		My goodness, what a lovely suit, sheriff.  Is that 
		seersucker?
Sheriff:	Nah, not on a civil servant's salary.  It's

% The sheriff notices Bart unshackling Marge's chains.  The family
