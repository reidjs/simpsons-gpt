  Bart: And that's what really happened.
Waiter: This is an outrage!  I am not a clumsy Clouseau-esque waiter.  I
        will --
         [trips on chair, falls out window into truck containing rat
        traps]
Waiter: At least, there were no big ones -- [snap] -- aie.
-- Only one big one, it seems, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

   Hutz: How could you have seen all this, Bart?  Weren't you supposed
         to be in school?
   Bart: [slowly] I sort of skipped school.
Skinner: I knew it!  I knew you'd slip up sooner or later, Simpson!
    Apu: What slip up?  What are you talking about?  He confessed it!
Skinner: Quiet, I need this.
-- Apu, accidental lawyer, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% The judge finds Freddy innocent and dismisses the case.  Quimby shakes
% his nephew's hand.

Skinner: Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there.  You testified
         for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in
         a noose.  On the other hand, you skipped school.
   Bart: I guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?
Skinner: [sighs] I'm a small man in some ways, Bart.  A small, petty
         man.  Three months' detention.
   Bart: [groans, {walks away}]
Skinner: {Wait a minute, Bart.  Make that...four months' detention.}
-- "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% In their bedroom that night, Homer and Marge lie surrounded by a horde
% of souvenirs from the Springfield Palace Hotel.

Homer: Well, Marge, it was horrible.  Everyone was against me in that
       jury room.  But I stood by the courage of my convictions and I
       prevailed.  And that's why we had chinese food for lunch.
Marge: Good for you, Homey!  You know, a lot of things happened around
       here while you were gone.
Homer: Right, Marge, I wanna hear all about it.  [puts on "open eye"
       glasses] Heh heh --
Marge: Gimme those!
Homer: Aw...[snap]
Marge: And those...
Homer: Aw...[snap]
Marge: And those...
Homer: Aw...
