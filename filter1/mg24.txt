% Homer and the kids walk through an aquarium exhibit.  Behind them is
% a wall of glass, through which we see seaweed floating and the
% occasional fish.

H: Stick close by, kids, and I'll explain everything you need to know about
   the briny deep.
L: [with reverence] I want to see a giant squid attack a sperm whale and
   battle to the death.
B: I want to swim free with the fishes.

% Bart produces a pair of swim trunks.

B: I brought my lucky red swim trunks.
H: All right, can the chatter and listen up.

% Close-up on Homer as he plays tour guide.

H: Here, we have the hideous Moray eel.

% The eel swims out of its hiding place, then scoots off.

H: And over here, we have the tasty but repulsive sea bass.

% The resemblance to Homer is uncanny.

L: [points offscreen] Yuck!  What the hell is that?

% Homer turns and reacts.

H: Bart!

% In the tank floats Bart, who gurgles...

B: Come on in!  The water's fine!

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:27]
%
% Bart floats in the tank as the girls and Homer watch.  Maggie sits on
% the railing.

H: [pointing at Bart]  Boy!  You come out of that tank right now!
L: Do some tricks, Bart!

% A shark swims past, Bart riding it like a horse.

L: Oh!

% The girls applaud.  Homer turns his back and folds his arms.

H: [grumbles]  Stop that.  It only encourages him.

% The shark swims past again, Bart standing on one leg on the shark's back.

L: Ah!

% The girls applaud.  Homer defiantly closes his eyes.

L: Dad, you gotta see this!

% Homer turns around, opens his eyes, and gasps.
%
% The shark swims past slowly, Bart's limp head hanging out of its mouth.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:42]
%
% Homer and the girls are on the aquarium roof looking into the tank.

L: Bart should be coming up for air any minute now.  Look, I see something!

% In the water floats a pair of swim trunks.  Homer fishes it out.

H: [sadly]  Lucky red swim trunks...
L: [sadly] Well, the trunks were lucky, even if Bart wasn't...

% Bart's head pops out of the water.

B: I'll take those.

% The girls smile with relief.  Bart leaps out (naked), grabs the
% swim trunks...

B: Thank you very much.

% ... and scurries off.

H: [trying to contain his anger] Bart... Come over here...

% Bart is back in the pool, as a shark circles him menacingly.

B: I'd like to accomodate you, Homer, but I'm afraid it's safer in here.
