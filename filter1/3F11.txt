% Abe wants to see what's on the other broadcasts and ends up wrecking
% the TV.  From whence the family drop him back off at the Retirement
% Castle.  Then the family cheer because now they get to buy a new
% TV.

 Bart: Let's go to the Sharper Image.  They've got a TV shaped like a
       '50s diner.
 Lisa: No, let's go to the Nature Company.  They've got a TV assembled
       by Hopi Indians.
-- The Simpsons go to buy a new TV,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Marge says they can't afford a store with philosophy just to get a
% TV, and the family goes to the Outlet Mall in Ogdenville.  Signs 
% pass: "Paved Road Ends - 64 Miles", "Former Japanese Internment Camp
% 90 Miles", "Ogdenville - 277 Miles"... Homer and Bart check out the 
% TVs available in a grey-market store.

   Homer: [gasps] Look at these low, low prices on famous brand-name
	  electronics!
    Bart: Don't be a sap, Dad.  These are just crappy knock-offs.
   Homer: Pfft.  I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it.  And look,
	  there's Magnetbox and Sorny.
Salesman: [walking up] Listen, I'm not going to lie to you.  Those
	  are all superior machines.  But if you like to watch your TV,
	  and I mean _really_ watch it, you want the Carnivale'.
	   [shows Homer and Bart a TV very similar to their old one]
	  It features two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand grip well,
	  durable outer casing to prevent fallapart...
   Homer: Sold.  You wrap it up, I'll start bringing in the pennies.
-- Seems like that TV and me have been together forever,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Meanwhile, Lisa and Marge shop for clothes.

   Marge: [holding up a headband] Mmm, honey, I don't think these 
	  clothes are us.
    Lisa: Who are they?
  Cletus: Hey, Brandine.  [holds up a short shirt reading "Classy 
	  Lassy"] You can wear this shirt to work.
Brandine: Oh, Cletus.  You know I gotta wear the shirt what Dairy
	  Queen give me.
-- Not even theirs?, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Lisa discovers a Chanel suit hidden within the racks of the bargain
% basement clothes.  It's $90, but marked down from $2800.  Marge
% tries it on, and Lisa thinks she looks sophisicated, "just like Mary
% Hart", but Marge still isn't convinced...

It wouldn't be right to buy something just for me.  If it were a
suit we all could wear, maybe...
-- Marge tries on a Chanel suit,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

 Lisa: Come on, Mom, you never treat yourself to anything.
Marge: Oh sure I do.  I treated myself to Sanka not three days ago.
-- You were out of Montreal Morn, I presume?,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

 Lisa: Just buy [the suit].  You don't have to rationalize everything.
Marge: All right, I will buy it.  It'll be good for the economy.
-- All Keynesian models considered,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Homer.

Homer: [whistles at Marge] You look great.
Marge: Really?  You like it?  Oh, I'd love to wear this someplace
       special.
Homer: Spurlock's Cafeteria, it is.
-- They got cocktail weenies there,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Marge was thinking more along the lines of the symphony or the
% theatre...

What's the point of going out?  We're just gonna wind up back here 
anyway.
-- Homer, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Later, we see an aria being sung, but as a vacuum fires up and
% lines of fuzz appear on your view, we see it's on TV.  (Marge is
% vacuuming with her suit on.)

% Marge buys some foodstuffs from the Kwik-E-Mart, wearing her suit.

Apu: Oh, Mrs. Simpson, you are looking very prosperous today.
     Might I interest you in some of our impulse items here by the
     cash register?  Perhaps a crazy motorized wiggle pen.
      [demonstrates]
     [laughing] Ohh, look at... the craziness.
-- Marge shops at the Kwik-E-Mart wearing a Chanel suit,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

 Woman: Attendant, I'd like some gas.
   Apu: Yes, I'm sorry, I do not speak English, okay.
 Woman: But you were just talking to...
   Apu: Yes, yes.  Hot dog, hot dog.  Yes sir, no sir.  Maybe, okay.
-- I learned my English from the Police Academy movies,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

Evelyn: Well, I can't pump [the gas] myself.  I'm calling AAA.
 Marge: [stops her] I used to be a little overwhelmed too, but it's not
	that hard.  I can show you.
Evelyn: Marge, is that you?  Marge Bouvier from high school?
 Marge: Um... yeah.  Hi... hi, Evelyn.
Evelyn: How about that?  Marge, you look wonderful.  And to think I
	heard you married Homer Simpson.
 Marge: I did marry Homer.
Evelyn: [pause] Come, you must show me the pumps.
-- Didn't go to the prom with him, though,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Outside, Marge shows Evelyn how to operate the gas pumps...

 Marge: 90% of the time, if the gas isn't pumping, this is your
	problem.  
	 [turns a switch at back which resets the pump]
Evelyn: Automotive skills and fashion sense.  Why, you've come a long
	way from the girl I knew nothing about in high school.
 Marge: We ran with our different crowds.  You had your debutante balls
	and... skinny-dipping, and I had my... home shoe repair course.
Evelyn: Oh Marge, you haven't changed a bit as far as I know.  Say, why
	don't you drop by the country club tomorrow?
	 [drives off]
	Oh, and bring the family. 
	 [Marge watches her pull off and smiles]
	 [Burns pulls up in a quadricycle]
 Burns: [honks horn (awooooga)] You there, fill it up with petroleum
	distillate, and re-vulcanize my tires, post-haste.
-- Love in the Time of Leaded Gasoline and Tiller Steering,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Marge gives the family advice on how to behave for the country
% club.

Marge: Bart, comb your hair.  Homer, I don't think you should wear a
       short-sleeved shirt with a tie.
Homer: But Sipowicz does it.
Marge: If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that too?
Homer: Ohh, wish I was Sipowicz.
 Lisa: Do I have to go?  That country club is a hotbed of exclusionist
       snobs and status-seeking social climbers.
Marge: I've told you, I don't like you using the word "hotbed".
       Please, Lisa, we so rarely get to do things like this.  And
       everybody, everybody _please_ be on your best behavior.  Bart,
       no grifting.
 Bart: [puts a deck of cards in his sleeve] Aw, raspberries.
-- Raspa-raspa-raspberries, 
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% The family arrive at the gates of the country club.

Gatekeeper: Name, please.
     Homer: Simpson family.
     Marge: We're not poor.
	     [looks around nervously]
	    Well, we're not.
-- At the gates of the country club, 
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% The gatekeeper says, "Go on in.  They're expecting you at the
% clubhouse."   The Simpsons drive in and "wow" excitedly at their posh

Everybody, keep smiling, and I know we're going to fit right in.

% [End of Act One.  Time: 6'27"]

% Evelyn welcomes Marge and her family to the country club.

Evelyn: Karin, Gillian, Elyzabeth, Patricia, Rauberta, Susan, meet
	Marge.
	 [the ladies greet Marge]
 Marge: Pleased to meet you.  You look like such a happy bunch... of
	people.
 Susan: That's the trouble with first impressions.  You only get to
	make one.
-- And you just made yours, jealous wannabe,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Evelyn reminds the family that they're free to enjoy the club,
% but they prefer to wait in the car until Marge is done fitting
% in.

% Later, Evelyn, Marge, and their warped rich friends discuss the
% benefits of mail order...  

I get the sneaking suspicion that L.L. Bean and Eddie Bauer are selling
me the same honey.
-- Susan, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Marge adds her two cents:

   Marge: I get food in the mail, but in a different way.  Every month,
	  Good Housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with 
	  recipes.  Sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you
	  cook yourself.
	   [pause from the ladies]
Patricia: Mmm.  That's so true, Marge.  One night, Wif and I came home
	  late.  We decided not to wake Iris, so instead, we microwaved
	  our own soup.  [laughs]
	   [the ladies murmur and agree]
	  Of course, it was a horrible mess, but Iris didn't mind
	  cleaning it up.
-- The secret ingredient is turntables,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% At home, Marge asks if everyone enjoyed the country club, but the
% family have a hard time agreeing.

 Bart: That place is weird.  A man in the bathroom kept handing
       me towels, until I paid him to stop.
Homer: [holding a stack of towels] Should have held out longer,
       boy.
-- You can never have enough towels,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

 Lisa: The rich are different from you and me
Marge: Yes, they're better.
-- Socially better, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

Today, while the rest of you were being different, I did a very good
job of fitting in.
-- Marge, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% ... so good, in fact, that Evelyn gave her a guest pass, and Marge
% hopes they might be invited to join.  "Boy, Marge." Homer remarks.  
% "You must have really done a number on those rich suckers!"  "Don't
% thank me," Marge tells him, "thank my beautiful new suit."

% Bart and Lisa observe Kent Brockman's daughter reject a baloney
% sandwich, telling the server she asked for abalone.  Lisa is
% infuriated, but her tirade is distracted by a man riding a pony.
% She cuts her tirade short to find out about the ponies.

% Meanwhile, Marge (still wearing the same Chanel suit) plays bridge
% with her friends, and discovers she has a winning hand.

Marge: [thinking] Oh, we've got a winning hand, we can take the 
       rest of the tricks.
	[camera pans higher up]
       [thinking] Oh, we'd better be careful.  The purpose of this
       game is to make friends.  You don't make friends by winning.
	[camera pans higher up]
       [thinking] Still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious
       winner.
	[camera pans to the end of her hair]
       [thinking] Don't ask me, I'm just hair.  Your head ended 18 
       inches ago.
-- A hair-brained scheme,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Marge plays her hand.  "I believe the rest are ours," she announces.
% Rauberta remarks that she and Susan could have stopped her if Susan
% had changed to a different suit.  Susan remarks, "I thought that 
% perhaps changing suits had gone out of fashion, eh Marge?"  Marge 
% "mmm"s to herself.

% Homer tries unsuccessfully to hit his golf ball, hitting himself in
% the foot.  He then attempts to cheat by changing his score card,
% but a fellow golfer tells him that the usual way of cheating is
% decreasing your score.  He introduces himself as Tom Kite, PGA golf
% pro, and shows Homer how to play.

Tom Kite: Now, you don't want to overthink.
   Homer: Not an issue.
Tom Kite: Keep your head down.
   Homer: [raising his head] Huh?
Tom Kite: Pretend there's no one else here.
	   [Homer scratches his butt with the club and burps]
	  And just go at your own pace. 
	   [Homer hits the ball very close to the hole]
	  Wow, very impressive.  You're a natural, Mr. Simpson.
   Homer: Really?
Tom Kite: Uh huh.  All you need is your own set of clubs, and stay
	  the _hell_ out of my locker!
	   [grabs the clubs]
	  [walking off] You can keep the shoes!
-- You're stuck here! (Mood swings!),
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% At home, Homer reads a book about golfing, while Marge alters her
% suit.

Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap?
-- Homer reads a book about golf,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

Marge: Homer, please.  I have to alter this suit so it looks
       different for tomorrow.
Homer: [yawns] Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed,
       will you, Marge?
-- Some rhinestones oughta do nicely as well,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Her friends at the country club are impressed by Marge's altered
% suit.

Rauberta: Love your outfit, Marge.  The vest says "Let's have lunch",
	  but the culottes say "You're paying".
-- At the country club, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Lisa gallops by on a pony.

Mom, look, I found something more fun than complaining!
-- Lisa rides the pony at the country club,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Evelyn tells Marge that if all goes right at Saturday's ball, she
% would be willing to sponsor Marge for membership.  Marge says "I'll
% be there with bells on", but Susan says, "Where exactly will you be
% attaching them to that mangled Chanel suit?"  Marge groans.

Don't worry, Marge.  [Susan's] idea of wit is nothing more than an
incisive observation humorously phrased and delivered with impeccable
timing.
-- Evelyn, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% At work, Homer shows off his golfing talent to Lenny and Carl by
% hitting golf balls into the toilet, and impresses them thoroughly
% by hitting one into the handicapped stall, seat down.  Meanwhile,
% Burns watches him intently on his video monitors.

   Burns: Who is that lavatory linksman, Smithers?
Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir.  One of the fork and spoon operators
	  from sector 7-G.
   Burns: Well, he's certainly got a loose waggle.  Perhaps I've
	  finally found a golfer worthy of a match with Monty Burns,
	  eh?
Smithers: His waggle is no match for yours, sir.  I've never seen you
	  lose a game.  Except for that one in '74 when you let
	  Richard Nixon win.  That was very kind of you, sir.
   Burns: Oh, he just looked so forlorn, Smithers, with his [imitating
	  Nixon]  "Oh, I can't go to prison, Monty.  They'll eat me 
	  alive!"
	   [Smithers laughs]
	  I wonder if this Homer Nixon is any relation?
Smithers: Unlikely, sir.  They spell and pronounce their names
	  differently.
   Burns: Bah.  Schedule a game and I'll ask him myself.
-- I run my plant precisely on "shedule",
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"
       
% At home, Homer tries to talk to Marge about the golfing challenge
% he got from Burns, while Marge once again alters her suit.

Oh, this game could mean big things for me, Marge.  If I beat
Mr. Burns, I mean really wallop him bad, I'm sure to get that big
raise I've been gunning for!
-- Homer, unclear on the concept,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

Marge: All right, all right, but if you win, don't make a
       scene and dance around with your "woo-hoo"s, please!  We
       can't afford a single slipup.  They're judging us.
	[Homer kisses Marge and Lisa, who is on the bed]
 Lisa: Mom, did you like horses when you were my age, 'cause I--?
Marge: I don't know.  Look, tonight is very important.  Mommy has to
       alter her suit so it looks like a totally new suit.
 Lisa: [75 RPM] Mom, do you want to know the fifteen reasons I like
       horses better than cars? One, a horse never has to--
Marge: I really need to concentrate on this, Lisa, would you mind
       just--?
 Lisa: You know how a horse goes like this?  [jumps up and down on
       the bed]  Mom, like this!
Marge: I've already altered this so many times, it's not impossible--
 Lisa: Whinny, whinny!  Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mo-m!
Marge: [yelling] LISA, PLEASE!!!
	[pause]
	[Lisa runs out while Marge continues her sewing] 
	[Marge pulls out her altered suit and examines it]
	[Marge pushes on the pedal and her suit gets pulled into the
       sewing machine]
       No!  No, no, no, noooo!
	[pulls out her mangled suit]
       At times like this, I guess all you can do is laugh.
	[5 second pause]
-- Or sit until we fade to black,

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 14'16"]

% Marge seeks help from Patty and Selma.

Marge: I need a formal dress for tonight!
Patty: You've come to the right place.
Selma: We've got classy duds up the yin-yang.
-- No dress too horrible, 
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% The first dress is "Fantasy in Maroon", an exceedingly large dress.
% "It's got some cigarette burns, but you can patch them with 
% NuVinyl."  Marge puts it in the "Maybe" pile.

% Then there's a Halloween costume that's too tight, but somehow made
% its way into Selma's regular rotation.

% Homer, meanwhile, arrives to play golf with Burns.

Homer: Good morning, Mr. Burns.  Beautiful day to be outside, isn't
       it?
Burns: Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add
       savor to my inevitable triumph.
Homer: [pause] Yes.
-- No, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Homer drives the ball up high, and he yells "Woo-hoo!" while it
% flies in the air, but it lands in the sand trap: "D'oh!"  Burns
% adds, "Yes, you're in deep d'oh now."  It's Burns' turn, and
% he hits the ball far.  Smithers remarks "Perfect as always, sir.
% Right on the green."

% Homer tries to get the ball out of the sand trap.

Burns: Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club.
       The sand wedge!
Homer: Mmm... open-faced club sandwich.
-- One-track mind, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Marge hurries back to the Ogdenville Outlet Mall.

% Homer and Burns advance to hole eight.  "You're four strokes behind,
% Simpson," Burns reminds Homer, and proceeds to hit a hook.  But
% Smithers uses binoculars to see the ball get on the green.  Homer
% bats his club on the ground repeatedly in anger, wondering how
% Burns can hit so far, and the club flies away from his hands,
% hitting Krusty (being advised by Tom Kite) in the head.  Kite
% scurries away.

     Marge: Miss? Miss?  Do you have a Chanel suit or any other
	    high quality clothes?
Saleswoman: No, ma'am, but we do have a shipment of slightly burned

     Marge: Oh, I give up.  [walks away]
    Cletus: What time and how burnt?
-- At night, burnt to a crisp,

% Burns and Homer continue their golf game, and Homer hits one far

% aid.

   Burns: Smithers, what are you doing up here?
   Homer: And what are you doing with this ball, and all those other
	  balls?
	   [many anagrammed golf balls pour forth from Smithers'
	  clothes]
Smithers: Uh, there are no other balls, just these, uh, reptile eggs.
	  Step away, they're endangered.
   Homer: [puts one in his mouth]  These aren't reptile eggs.  You've
	  been cheating!  No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball,
	  you put a fresh one on the green.
   Burns: [gasps] Cheating?  For me?  Why, Smithers, that's patently
	  unnecessary.  I'm one of the world's finest golfers.  Why,
	  in all the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a--
	  [realizing] Oh.
-- Megalomania is shot down again,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Smithers would prefer that Homer kept silent so that they could

% At night, Marge searches one of the posher parts of Springfield

	[Homer drives to the entrance of the country club]
Marge: Homer, what are you doing?
Homer: I'm driving up to the main building.  They got valet parking.
Marge: We can't drive this up there.  They'll see the dent.  They'll
       see the coat hanger antenna.  Stop the car, we're walking.
Homer: But Marge, valets!  Maybe for once, someone will call me "sir"
       without adding, "You're making a scene."
-- Yes, sir, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% But Marge will have none of it.  She pulls the keys out and they

 Homer: I'm going to regale everyone with my anecdote.  You know, the

	"bleep" me this time?
  Bart: I'm going to pose as an Italian count and get some old lady to
	leave me all her money.
  Lisa: I'm going to ask people if they know their servant's last

 Marge: No, no, no!  Not tonight!  No vulgarity, no mischief, no

Let's go.  I wouldn't want to join any club that would have _this_
