% The living room.  Marge sits on a chair and knits.  Bart plays with a
% punching bag, Lisa spanks a rabbit doll (which goes ``squeak'' at each
% spank), Maggie toys with a rattle.  And Homer stands behind a genuinely
% ancient camera, the kind with an accordion lens and a <huge> flash.

H: Come on everybody, it's time for the family portrait!

% Nobody pays any attention.

H: Let's bunch together now.  Here we go!

% Nobody pays any attention.

H: Move it!

% The rest of the family zip into position.  From left to right, Bart,
% Lisa, Marge and Maggie.  Marge has one arm on each of the girl's shoulders.

H: Perfecto.  Everybody smile.

% They do, to an extreme.  (Including Maggie, who smiles through her
% pacifier.)

H: I'm going to set the automatic timer.

% Homer sets the timer and rushes to get into the picture just as the flash
% goes off.  Bart has been pushed out of the frame (only his arm is showing),
% Lisa and Maggie have been separated from their mother, and Homer stands
% directly in front of Marge, creating a four-armed creature with Homer's
% face and Marge's hair.

% The family wait impatiently.  This time, they've left a space for
% Homer to stand in.

H: [o.s.] Almost ready.  Here we go.
B: Let's get the show on the road, man.
   We've got things to do.
L: Yeah, Dad.

% Homer sets the camera timer.

H: Okay, here we go.
L: Make room for Jumbo...

% ... and joins the family between Lisa and Marge.
% They all smile.  Marge and Maggie smile without showing their teeth.

H: [through his teeth] What'd you say?
L: [through her teeth] Nuthin'.
H: [through his teeth] All right, everybody.  Squeeze in real tight.

% They squeeze together.  Marge shows some cleavage.

H: [through his teeth] I want us all to get us all in the picture this time.
   Closer.

% They squeeze in even more tightly, and everybody shows their teeth.
% Bart folds his arms and leans in from the left.  Maggie and Lisa move
% in front.  Marge puts her arm around Homer.

H: [through his teeth] Closer!

% Just has he pulls everyone in tighter, the flash goes off.
% The family are mushed together into a jumble that would make Picasso
% proud, with eyes, noses, mouths, and arms all over the place.

% Third time's a charm.  Or so they say.  Marge is visibly tired.

H: Okay, hold still.  This is the last picture on the roll.
B: [tired, rolls his eyes] Praise the Lord.
H: Watch your mouth, you little smart-ass.

% Homer peers into the viewfinder and focuses on Bart sticking out his
% tongue.

L: Yeah, Bart.

% Homer looks up at Bart, who has since put on an innocent face.  Homer
% scowls, then brightens.

H: Nothing's going to ruin this one.

% Homer sets the timer.

H: The timer's a-tickin'!

% Homer joins the family.  Bart makes a weird face.

L: [tattling] Bart's making faces, Dad.
H: Bart!

% Bart's face quickly returns to normal.  Everybody smiles a toothy smile,
% including Maggie.  Marge's half-closed eyes slowly droop.

H: [through his teeth] This one's going to be the Simpsons at our finest.
   Smile.  Look cheerful.  Here we go...

% Bart resumes making faces.

H: [through his teeth] Here we go...

% The faces get weirder.

H: [through his teeth] Here we go...

% And weirder.

H: [through his teeth] Why you little...!

% As the picture is taken, Homer lunges for Bart.  The Simpsons Family
% Portrait consists of Homer strangling Bart, Lisa and Maggie making
% faces at the camera, and Marge asleep.
