% Bart and Lisa watch an Itchy and Scratchy episode, "The Last Traction
% Hero".  Scratchy works out with a large dumbbell; after three overhead
% lifts, his entire upper body becomes huge and muscular.  He flexes a
% bit, proud, then walk over to Itchy menacingly.  Upon seeing him flex
% his biceps and chest, Itchy thinks for a moment, then smiles and pulls
% out a pink balloon and a pin.  He bursts the balloon, then pokes
% Scratchy in the chest, hoping for the same result, but all that
% happens is that a drop of blood leaks out.  Scratchy laughs evilly,
% but Itchy pokes many holes in his upper torso in rapid succession.
% This, too, seems to have no effect, and Scratchy laughs again, but as
% the blood leaks out from all the pinpricks, Scratchy feels weak and
% sits down on a bench to rest.  Itchy brandishes a chainsaw and slices
% off the cat's bicep and chest muscles.
%
% Bart and Lisa, as usual, laugh.  Itchy stops and turns to the camera.

   Itchy: Thanks, kids.  Now we'd like to speak to you seriously for a
          moment.
Scratchy: Yup.  This week is the grand opening of "Itchy and Scratchy
          Land" -- the violentest place on earth[tm].
   Itchy: And to celebrate, for this week only, we're cutting ticket
          prices in half.  [pulls out scissors]
           [Scratchy pulls out a card saying "ticket prices"]
           [Itchy stabs the scissors through Scratchy's brain]
Scratchy: Yow!  [pulls out scissors and brain together]

           [camera pulls out to show Krusty standing next to a TV which
          he turns off]
  Krusty: Kids, you heard the cartoon rat.  If you haven't already run
          to your parents begging to go, do it now.  You won't be
          missing anything funny: I'll just be sitting here reading this
          grownup's newspaper.  ["Racing Form"] [laughs] Go now!
-- Those krazy klown endorsements, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Bart and Lisa scream briefly then run off.  Homer sits on the couch
% reading the Bible as the children run in.

     Lisa: Dad, remember how you said going to Itchy and Scratchy Land
           would be too damned expensive?
    Homer: Oh, everything's too damned expensive these days.  Look at
           this bible I just got -- fifteen bucks!  And talk about a
           preachy book...everybody's a sinner!  [points to a verse]
           Except for this guy.
     Bart: But now Itchy and Scratchy Land is cutting ticket prices in
           half!  Can we go, Dad?  Can we, can we, can we?  Take it,
           Lis.
     Lisa: Can we?

        [Homer and Marge look interested]
       Yeah!  Dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars

Marge: Hmm, Recipe-Related Bumper Cars.
-- Something for everyone, it seems, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Bart and Lisa gasp, look at one another, then cheer and jump on the

Marge: Now wait a minute, I'm not sure about this.  Every time we've
       ever gone on vacation I end up being horribly embarrassed.  We
       end up in a big fight and we come home more miserable than when
       we left.  You have to promise me that this isn't going to happen
       this time.
Homer: Embarrassed?  What are you talking about?
Marge: Well, there was our trip to the Amish country...
Homer: Oh, yeah...

 Bart: Don't worry Mom, we'll make you proud of us.

% The car is packed with everyone inside, and Marge gives last-minute

   Abe: No!  I ain't senile, dad blast it.
 Marge: OK, bye bye.
 Homer: Bye!

Homer: [looking at map] North...south...aw, nuts to this!  I'm going to
       take a shortcut.
Marge: Homer, no, you're going to get lost.
Homer: Trust me, Marge.  With today's modern cars, you _can't_ get lost,

-- A typical Homer non sequitur, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Homer turns off the highway onto a dirt road.  In the next shot, the
% car is missing its roof and has a wooden cart wheel in place of one of
% its tires.  A US Army missile and school crossing sign decorate its
% front while a homecoming banner drags behind it.  But they _have_
% arrived at Itchy and Scratchy Land, as Homer promised.  A chicken
% flies out of Marge's hair as Homer says, "All right, we're here.  Now
% let us never speak of the shortcut again."
%
% The family walk away from their car and Homer asks everyone to
% remember that they're in the Itchy lot.  The camera pulls back to show
% a huge number of cars in the same lot, then pans to show another
% packed lot called the Scratchy lot.
%
% The family takes a helicopter to the island.

Pilot: We're now approaching our final destination, Itchy and Scratchy
       Land: the amusement park of the future where nothing can possi-
       blye go wrong.
        [everyone looks worried]
       Er, possi_bly_ go wrong.  Heh, that's the first thing that's ever
       gone wrong.
-- Second, actually, the first being that nothing could go wrong, "Itchy

% The helicopter flies into the mouth of a giant stone Scratchy hewn
% from the very living rock.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 7:03]
%
% The entrance to the park is a bustle of activity.  Above the "Itchy &
% Scratchy Land Grand Opening" sign, a giant Itchy repeatedly pounds a
% giant Scratchy's head with a bat, while the latter pounds the former
% in turn with a mallet.  The ticket booths are large bombs with lit
% wicks.  At the booth the Simpsons are in front of, a sign announces
% the rides not working today: the Head Basher, the Blood Bath, the
% Mangler, and the Nurse's Station.  Homer steps up to the booth.

Homer: One adult and four children.
Woman: Would you like to buy some Itchy and Scratchy Money?
Homer: What's that?
Woman: Well it's money that's made just for the park.  It works just
       like regular money, but it's, er..."fun".
 Bart: Do it, Dad.
Homer: Well, OK, if it's fun...let's see, uh...I'll take $1100 worth.
        [he walks in, sees all the signs: "No I&S Money", "We Don't Take
       Itchy and Scratchy Money", etc.]
       Aw!
-- So much for fun, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% One "ride" is the "Tavern on the Scream", the door to which is guarded
% by a giant Itchy in a chef's uniform who chops in front of the
% entrance with a meat cleaver repeatedly.  The family runs inside,
% Homer just missing getting chopped.

 Bart: Oh wow, cool!
 Lisa: Aw, cool!  That is neato.
Marge: Such a violent motif.
 Bart: Yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is _actually_
       beneficial for children.  [kicks Lisa]
 Lisa: Ow!  [punches Bart]
 Bart: Ow!
Marge: Hmm...
Guard: [laughs] There's no need to murmur, ma'am.  Here at Itchy and
       Scratchy Land we're just as concerned about violence as you are.
       That's why we're always careful to show the consequences of
       deadly mayhem so that we may educate as well as horrify.
Marge: _When_ do you show the consequences?  On TV that mouse pulled out
       that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe, but in the next
       scene the cat was breathing comfortably.
Guard: Just like in real life.

 Marge: Bart!
 Homer: Eyeball stew.
 Marge: Homer!  We just got here and already I'm mortified beyond belief
        by your embarrassing behavior.
  Bart: I was just ordering a cheeseburger, Mom.  They have violent
        names for everything here.
 Marge: Oh, I see.  All right, hmm...I'll have the Baby Guts.
Waiter: Lady, you disgust me.  Ew.
  Lisa: [embarrassed] Mom, that's veal.
 Marge: Oh...
-- Mmm...extra pus, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Marge drops Maggie off at the child care center and asks the woman

-- Marge reads the park map, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Homer exclaims, "Oh, look!  It's the 12:00 noon robot parade.  Hurry
% up or we'll have to wait for the 12:05 parade."  Bombs and sticks of
% dynamite with legs march along to an up-beat version of the Itchy and
% Scratchy theme music.  A Scratchy robot wields an axe; an Itchy robot
% runs a chainsaw.  Bart and Lisa smile as they watch.
%
% An Itchy and Scratchy robot pair walk next to each other and hit each
% other with mallets; blood even flies from their heads.  Another pair
% shoot each other repeatedly with short bursts from a machine gun.  The
% people watching the parade getting splattered by blood don't seem to
% mind -- rather, they seem to be enjoying it.  "Wow," gasps Bart, "this
% is so much like my dreams, it's scary."  A steamroller driven by a man
% in an Itchy costume rolls by, a flattened Scratchy rolling around and
% around on its roller, followed by some marching axes.

 Lisa: Aw, look at that cute little baby ax.
        [baby ax runs to catch up with bigger axes]
Marge: It's cute, but I'm sure it's very sharp and probably dirty.
Guard: [walks up] [laughs] Dirty, mabye -- dangerous, hardly.  These are
       the latest state-of-the-art animatronic robots.  They have
       sensors that ensure they only attack each other, never the
       guests.  [laughs]
        [Itchy robot's point of view shows it identifying "Scratchy" and
       "Kill", then "humans" and "Do not hurt"]
        [robot turns, takes the top of its head off and bows]
Marge: See all that stuff in there, Homer?  That's why your robot never
       worked.
-- What without all those silicon chips and such, "Itchy and Scratchy
    Land"

% After the parade, the family enter the "Log Ride" which appears to
% have a steep, tall mountain as part of it.  They are seated in a log-
% shaped boat and metal handrails are locked in front of them as the
% ride begins.  "This is just what I hoping for -- spending the day
% together as a family --" Marge begins, but just then the log drops
% suddenly down a steep slope and everyone screams.  The log goes
% through a series of crossbows and cannons which fire and just miss
% them, stopping suddenly inches shy of long metal spikes placed
% strategically at eye-level.  But the horror doesn't have time to sink
% in as the boat falls down another steep slope straight towards a
% buzzsaw.  The boat is sliced in half (the family managing barely to
% avoid the same fate), and its members are dumped unceremoniously on a
% mat next to the river.  Bart and Lisa cheer happily.

Marge: You know, part of spending time together as a family is spending
       time apart as individuals.
Homer: Parents' Island?
Marge: Y'uh huh.  I'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when
       we meet up at dinner.  Are you kids going to be all right?
       [looks around] Kids?

% playing.

%
% Maggie manages to claw her way to the surface of the sea of balls, as

%
% Bart and Lisa watch "The Roger Meyers Story" in a stand-up movie
% theater.

Roger Meyers senior, the gentle genius behind Itchy and Scratchy, loved
and cared about almost all the peoples of the world.  And he, in turn,
was beloved by the world, except in 1938 when he was criticized for his
controversial cartoon, "Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors".
-- The narrator tells "The Roger Meyers Story", "Itchy and Scratchy
    Land"

% "Among his proudest achievements was the full-length musical
% `Scratchtasia'," continues the narrator.  A clip shows Scratchy
% dressed in a red robe wearing a blue hat with white stars trying to
% escape being chopped by Itchy with an ax.  Scratchy manages to wrest
% the ax from the mouse's grasp, then, glaring threateningly, he chases
% the mouse through a door.  In silhouette we see Scratchy chop the
% hapless Itchy into pieces.  Relieved, he walks back into the room, but
% the individual pieces of Itchy each turn into a miniature ax-wielding
% Itchy.  The troupe threaten Scratchy again, but he chops them all up
% and pounds them into a red pulp.  Exhausted, he pulls up a stool, sits
% down, and breathes deeply.  The fumes from the Itchy pulp enter his
% body and turn into microscopic Itchys that hack away at his insides.
% Scratchy grows old quickly, his skin wrinkling and turning grey, then
% crumbling from his body.
%
% Outside, at another robot parade, a yokel drawls, "Hey Moe, I'm gonna
% get me a picture of this crazy critter."  The flash from his camera
% makes a Scratchy robot spark.  The ubiquitous guard walks up, laughs
% nervously, and says, "Uh, no flash photography, please."  The sick
% robot walks disjointedly away.
%
% Bart and Lisa continue to watch "The Roger Meyers Story".

           and run amok in an orgy of blood and kicking and the biting
           with the metal teeth and the hurting and shoving.
Repairman: How much time do we have, professor?
    Frink: [checks clipboard] Well, according to my calculations, the
           robots won't go berserk for at least 24 hours.
            [Scratchy robot grabs men by the throat]
            [Itchy robot goes after another man]
           Oh, I forgot to, er, carry the one.
-- A small miscalculation, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Marge manages to get her husband and son released.  They walk out.

Marge: I have nothing to say to you.
Homer: But Marge, I was a political prisoner!
Marge: How were you a political prisoner?
Homer: I kicked a giant mouse in the butt!  Do I have to draw you a
       diagram?
-- Homer, master flowcharter, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Suddenly, the power goes off all over the park.  "Oh, for gosh sakes,
% what now?" grumbles Marge.  A group of robots walk out, look over at
% the family, then raise their weapons menacingly and walk inexorably
% towards them.  Through the eyes of an Itchy robot, we see it identify
% Homer as Scratchy with the message "Kill".  "Hey look, this one's
% coming on to me.  Yoo hoo!  Mr. Robot!"  Homer calls flirtatiously.

% The Itchy robot continues to walk towards Homer, its ax raised.

 Lisa: Dad, I think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your
       friend.
Homer: Lisa!  [robot swipes at him with ax] Don't [swipe!] contradict
       [swipe!] your [swipe!] elders!  [swipe!  Homer's two hairs are
       cut off] Aah!  My hair.  You chopped off my hair!  Oh God, I'm
       ugly.
-- Truth is slow to dawn sometimes, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% "I _knew_ we should have gone to the bird sanctuary," rues Marge.
% There, however, everyone is suddenly chased by birds gone mad.  Hans
% Moleman orders a seed bell in a phone booth as birds crash into the
% glass all around him.
%
% Our favorite family runs away from the robot horde.

Bart: A chopper!  We're saved!
 Man: [in Itchy costume] Hey!  You're the guys that didn't like our
      capering.  When you get to hell, tell 'em Itchy sent you.  [kicks
      Bart and Homer]
-- Hell hath no fury like an Itchy scorned, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

       [the robots close in]
Marge: Oh, my.  It looks like we're doomed.
Homer: Back, you robots!  Nobody ruins my family vacation but me...and
       maybe the boy!
-- He got that part right, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Homer pulls his wallet from his pocket and throws it at the robots,
% followed by two handfuls of change, a banana, his underwear...and his
% camera.  The flash goes off, making four robots collapse.

 Lisa: Dad!  The flash must have scrambled their circuits.
Homer: What are you, the narrator?
 Lisa: Aah!  Just keep taking pictures!
        [Homer snaps another shot and an Itchy collapses]
 Bart: [grabbing its mallet] I'll get more cameras!
        [runs over to camera shop, smashes window, grabs cameras]
        [turns back] Smashy, smashy!  [smashes another window]
Marge: I don't approve of that...
-- Not the time for approval, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% The family all snap pictures repeatedly, and robot after robot fizzles
% and falls over.

 Bart: [German accent] Hey mouse...say cheese.
        [snaps picture; an Itchy robot collapses]
       With a dry, cool wit like that, I could be an action hero.
        [the family snaps more photos]
        [Homer emerges from a pile of robots]
Homer: Die, bad robots, die!  [laughs] With a dry, cool wit like that, I
       could be an action hero.
-- Yeah, real dry, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

 Bart: Who would have thought that our visit to Itchy and Scratchy Land
       would turn out to be our best vacation ever?
 Lisa: Yeah, best ever!
Marge: Are you two bonkers?  We almost got killed...not to mention all
       the embarrassment I suffered.
 Lisa: But Mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation: it brought
       us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors,
       and we have so many memories.
Marge: [pause] You know, you're right.  This truly _was_ the best
       vacation ever.  Now let us never speak of it again.
-- "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Roger Meyers Jr. puts in an appearance.

Meyers: As Roger Meyers Jr., the owner of the park, I'd like to thank
        you for stopping the killer robots, and to show my appreciation,
        here are two free passes.
 Homer: But there are five of us.
Meyers: [angry] Here are two free passes!
 Homer: That's better.
-- I don't get it, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Dr. Frink kneels over the inert body of a robot.

    Frink: Man, if this is happening here, I'd hate to think of what's
           happening in Euro Itchy and Scratchy Land, n-hey.
            [shot of empty parking lot in said park]
Booth man: [French accent] Hello?  Itchy and Scratchy Land open for
           business.  Who are you to resist it, huh?
           Come on.  My last paycheck bounced.  My children need wine.
-- Art imitates life, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"

% Back at home, safe, the children laugh at the end of an Itchy and
% Scratchy cartoon.  Marge watches it with them.

Marge: I hope you realize now that violence on TV may be funny, but it's
       not so funny when that violence is happening to you.
 Bart: [smug] But it _would_ be funny to someone who was watching us.
Marge: Hmm...
 Lisa: No, Mom, he's right.  [takes off shoe] Observe:
        [throws it at Bart]
        [Marge laughs involuntarily; Lisa and Bart laugh too]
Marge: Oh, my!  Lisa, go to your room.
 Lisa: Aw...
-- Marge refuses to see the light, "Itchy and Scratchy Land"
