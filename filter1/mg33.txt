% In the living room, Homer reclines on the couch while Marge knits.

H: Urgh.  [annoyed]  Do you hear that?
M: What, dear?
H: The punching bag.
M: They're just playing, Homer.
H: I can't sleep with that racket.  Go tell them to knock it off.
M: I like the punching bag sound.  You go tell them if you don't like it.
H: [threatening]  I said do it, now move it!

% Marge angrily gets up off the couch.  The punching doubles in intensity.

H: D'oh!

% Homer lies face-down on the floor as the rest of the family look on,
