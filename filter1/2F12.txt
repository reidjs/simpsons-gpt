% It's the Krusty the Klown Show.  Krusty rides out on a bicycle, in
% front of the camera and off to the side.  He rides back on a smaller
% bike, then a smaller one still, then a smaller one still, until he's
% riding a bicycle no more than six inches tall.  He does a loop-the-
% loop around a metal track without falling off, then poses triumphantly
% on one knee, tossing the bicycle into the air and swallowing it.  The
% children cheer happily.

Lisa: When Krusty wants to, he can still blow 'em away.
Bart: Yes.  He can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle
      and make it funny.

% grin turns somber.  He pulls out a pack of cigarettes.

Krusty: Ah, there's nothing better than a cigarette...unless it's a
        cigarette lit with a $100 bill!

Krusty: Did you send those thousand roses to Bea Arthur's grave?
  Bill: [exasperated] Yes, but she's still --
Krusty: I don't want to hear the end of any sentences!
 Woman: [over intercom] George Carlin on three.
Krusty: [answers it] Yeah?...Lawsuit?  Oh, come on.  My "Seven Words You
        Can't Say on TV" bit was _entirely_ different from _your_ "Seven

           [points it at Homer, cocks trigger]
          I cannot do it.  To murder a funny man of such genius would be
          a crime.  Ah, tell you what, Krusty: do for me my favorite
          trick where you ride the little bike for me through the loop,
          and I will let you live.
   Homer: Oh, but I've never been able to do that --
           [trigger is cocked] Hey, how about if I just squirt you in
          the face with my boutoniere?
           [trigger cocks more] OK.
-- The power of persuasion, "Homer the Clown"

% Homer grabs a little bike and frets, "I'll never be able to do this
% trick.  Never!"  At Vittorio's prodding, he balances on the bike and
% succeeds in riding it towards the loop.  "Hey!  I'm doing it, I'm
% doing it!" he cries gleefully, riding up the loop -- but as he gets to
% the top, he slides back down to the bottom again.  "Ta da," he
% finishes lamely.

Vittorio: The fact that you did not do the trick well is the biggest
          insult of all -- [cocks gun]
  Krusty: [bursting in] Hey guys, I came to -- oh, you've got a deadly
          game of cat and mouse going.  I'll come back.
    Legs: [gasps] I'm seeing double here: four Krustys!
   Homer: Krusty!  Oh thanks, thanks a lot.  You came here to save me!
  Krusty: [slowly] Yeah, that's what I did.
Vittorio: My apologies to you.  I almost made a grievous error.  [cocks
          gun at Krusty] Goodbye, Krusty.
  Krusty: Wait: he can't kill anybody if he doesn't know which one is
          the real Krusty.
           [grabs Homer by the head and plays the shell game with
          himself and Homer]
Vittorio: I am confused.
   Homer: Heh heh.  Good one, Krusty.
           [Vittorio cocks the gun at Krusty]
  Krusty: Oh, crap.
-- That's putting it mildly, "Homer the Clown"

% Vittorio menaces, "Because of that disrespectful display, I shall now
% kill both of you -- unless you _both_ go through the loop...together!"
% The two klowns moan at the thought, but they try it, Krusty riding,
% Homer perched on top.  In his fear and in his attempt to hold tight,
% Homer covers Krusty's eyes with his hands.  Krusty admonishes him, but
% they miss the loop entirely and ride up a pool cue right onto the pool
% table.  They ride straight into the racked-up Boston balls -- and sink
% every one of them.  The Italians are visibly impressed.
%
% The antics don't stop there, however.  The two klowns jump across a
% gap onto the bar; Homer's head plays "The Godfather" theme music on
% the wine glasses that dangle from the roof.  "Ah!" gasp the Italians.
% Krusty sees that the part of the bar that lifts up so the bartender
% can get out is raised.  Thinking quickly, he knocks it closed with
% seltzer.  The Italians even applaud, but Vittorio moans, "Ah, but
% without the loop it is nothing," cocking his gun again.
%
% He's spoken too quickly -- Krusty and Homer fly off the bar, straight
% towards the loop, and whizz around and around it many times.  They fly
% off together and skillfully land in the "Ta da!" pose; the miniature
% bike flies towards them, and Krusty, although he opens his mouth to
% catch it, is beaten to the punch by Homer, who swallows it and makes
% the bell ring by opening his mouth.

Italians: Yay, Krustys!  [applauding]
Vittorio: Grazie, grazie.  You have a brought great joy to this old
          Italian stereotype.
    Legs: No, no, Don Vittorio, you're not --
Vittorio: Yes, I am, I know it, I am.  Anyway, thank you, Krusty.
  Krusty: You're welcome.  So, uh, we're even now, huh?
Vittorio: No, we just won't kill you.  But you still owe us the money.
          [ominous] $48.
  Krusty: [hands him a bill] Here's $50.
Vittorio: And two your change, and we thank you.
-- Come again!, "Homer the Clown"
