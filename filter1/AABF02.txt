Burns:         Ah, lunchtime!  Well, let's see what I've packed for

Smithers:      Would you like me to drain Simpson while he's passed

Burns:         No, no.  To attract the top grads, we'll need to make a
               recruitment film.  A picture that showcases our cutting-
               edge technology.
Smithers:      A "talkie", sir?

Homer:    Well, there were script problems from day one.

Lisa:     You might as well.  You already made up a phony film credit.
Homer:    No!  Homer Simpson does not lie twice on the same form.  He
          never has, and he never will.
Marge:    You lied dozens of times on our mortgage application.
Homer:    Yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies.  The

% Grateful Dead bears walk by, a skeleton tips his hat (skull attached)
% to wish him good morning, the hammers from Pink Floyd's "The Wall"
% march by, and the Rolling Stones' lips fly at him.  He screams.
%
% Meanwhile, on a park bench somewhere, Abe and Jasper sit laughing
% stupidly and uncontrollably, each with a bottle of the vegetable
% drink.
%
% Down at the police station, Chief Wiggum looks over to see one of his
% officers spinning in a chair, laughing dreamily, holding a bottle of
% Homer's beverage.

Wiggum:   Lou!  Lou, are you all right?
Lou:      The electric yellow has got me by the brain banana ...
Wiggum:   I ... see.
          [Chief Wiggum takes the bottle from Lou's hand and dabs his
          finger with it, giving it a taste]
Wiggum:   My God, it's nothing but carrots and peyote.
Eddie:    Damn longhairs never learn, Chief.
Wiggum:   Eh, it's time for an old-fashioned hippie ass-whomping!
-- Any time's a good time for that, "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Moments later, three squad cars and a police truck and tank pull up
% to Groovy Grove.  Wiggum addresses the house's inhabitants with a
% bullhorn.

Wiggum:   Attention hippies!  Come out peacefully so we can smash your
          drug mill and all your worldly possessions!
Seth:     Officer, please.  We can explain.
Homer:    Not so fast, pig.  We're making a stand!  A freaky stand!
          You can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll
          have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!
Munchie:  This man does not represent us.
Wiggum:   All right, boys, set your nightsticks on "whomp".
Eddie:    Uh, mine's ... stuck on twirl.
Wiggum:   Oh, for the love of ... [sets baton] there.  Now let's crack
          some skulls.
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% The cops advance on them, anxious to crack a few skulls, when Homer
% puts his arms around his juice-making associates.

Homer:    Seth, Munchie.  They can destroy our bodies and our ponchos,
          but they can never silence our song of protest!  [singing]
          Uptown girl, she's been living in her white-bread world ...
          come on, guys!
Wiggum:   Forget the clubs, just shoot 'em!
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% The police officers each hold up a rifle, cocking them loudly; Homer
% makes his final stand.

Homer:    Look at yourselves!  Pointing guns at your fellow man.
          Hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free.  Yes, the
          sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since
          extinguished, but it's ideals live on!
          [gathering a handful of daisies, he places a flower into the
          barrels of each officer's rifle; with every one, he invokes
          the names of those ideals]
          Freedom!  Love!  And peace.
          [as he places the last flower inside Chief Wiggum's rifle, he
          screams "D'oh" when the gun goes off]
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Later, at the Springfield Cemetery, a small group gathers for a
% funeral.
%
% Elsewhere, at the Springfield Hospital, Homer lies in a hospital bed
% with a flower stuck in his forehead.  His family and Dr. Hibbert look
% on.

Marge:    Doctor, will he be all right?
Hibbert:  Yes, he was lucky.  If that had been a gladiola, he'd be dead
          right now.
Bart:     Why don't you just pull it out?
Hibbert:  [laughs] I'm a doctor, not a gardener!
Homer:    Can't you just prune some of the leaves so I can watch TV?
Hibbert:  What did I just say?
-- I'm a doctor, not a gardener, dammit!  "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Instead of the normal credits, we see a psychedelic background, as
% the Simpsons theme is played on sitar.  Homer sings a few lines from
% "Uptown Girl," over the credits.  When the Gracie Films logo is shown,
% he murmurs, "I buried Flanders".
