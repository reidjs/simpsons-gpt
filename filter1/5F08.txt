% Marge is frustrated with SLH because he refuses to go outside to do his 
% business; she tries shoving SLH out the door, but he remains still in 
% place.  Homer is in the kitchen, eating and watching her.

Homer: The experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you 
       should do it yourself first to show him how.
Marge: [angrily] I'm not going to the bathroom in the backyard!
Homer: Sorry, your majesty.
-- Queen of Dog Business, "Bart Carny"

% Marge walks outside to the backyard and clearly sees that the yard has 
% grass up to her knees.  "Yuck!" she says, and complains that the kids
% should have kept the yard clean.  Marge walks along the yard picking up 
% things the kids left all over.  When she comes upon a snake, Marge shrieks 
% and reacts quickly by throwing it into the Flanders' yard.  At this, we 
% hear Ned scream.

Marge: Ned, I'm so sorry.

% The kids make "ding ding" noises, wanting their allowence.
% The noises the kids make are loud enough to make Homer run out of the

Marge: That backyard is a disgrace. Now get busy.
 Lisa:  That's a good suggestion, mom.
 Bart:  We'll take it under advisement.
-- To see, to view, to take under advisement, "Bart Carny"

% about.

Marge: [proceeding to yard] Kids, I made some lemonade for you.
 Bart: [from living room couch, off-screen] Sounds great.
 Lisa: Bring it in here.
Marge: [realizes they're inside] What the...? What are you doing in 
       here?
 Bart: Work was hard, so we quit.
Marge: What?!
 Lisa: Hard work made us quit.
Marge: I see. Well, then, no chores, no allowance.
 Lisa: Okay. We get our room and board free anyways.
 Bart: And Santy Claus provides the rest. [Marge grumbles]
-- Love thy Santy Claus, "Bart Carny"  

% Bart and Lisa hear carnival music playing outside. They rush to the window 
% to see a line of carnival trucks pass by their house. Bart exclaims that

       what you need!

-- "Bart Carny"

% The family walk up to a ride known as the 'Tooth Chipper'. It does
% exactly what it says.

Homer: Ooh, ooh!  Me first.
Marge: You can't go on that.  You have a heart condition.
Homer: Heart condition?  Get out of here.
Marge: You had a quadruple bypass.  You nearly died.  Don't you remember?
Homer: Obviously, I don't.  Now if you get out of my way.
-- "Bart Carny"

He's not just some guy, Marge.  He's a Carny and part of a noble tradition.

they may be rat-like in appearance, they are truly kings among men.
-- Homer on carnies, "Bart Carny"
         
% Later, Bart and Lisa walk off to the ride, 'Screamatorium'.
% Bart and Lisa check out the ride, which turns out to be just as pathetic
% as it's title. They exit dissatisfied.

[angrily] Why does this always happen when I stand here?  What is it about
this exact spot? [He gets squirted again] It's happening again.
-- Krusty stood next to a clown-squirting game, "Bart Carny"

% Some carnys look for "pigeons." Daddy carny notices Homer. They trick him
% into playing a ring-toss game, and he loses.

Cooder: Oh, listen, pal.  I got a son of my own.  Here. [Cooder hands
        Homer a large-sized comb]
 Homer: [sniffles] A novelty comb.  Kings among men.

% Homer and Bart listen to Colonel Tex's attraction of Hitler's Limousine.
% Colonel Tex entertains the crowd by stating that it was the first

Hey, come on.  He doesn't have any money.  Look at his clothes.
-- Homer, on Bart, "Bart Carny"

  Tex: I don't know. You going to get drunk and start a lot of 
       trouble?
Homer: Sure.  Anything you want.
  Tex: All right.  See you tomorrow, 6:00 a.m. And you're gonna work
       like you've never work before! [walks away]
-- Homer trying to get a job as a carny, "Bart Carny"

        your snow cone.
  Spud: Aw, heck!
-- Breakfast of Carnies, "Bart Carny"

% Homer and Bart approach Cooder and Spud.

Cooder: Hey, you lost your money fair and square!  I didn't scam nobody!
 Homer: [laughing] Put down your stick.  We're here to work.
  Bart: Starting today, we're Carnies, just like you.
Cooder: Well, in that case, let me show you how I scammed you.
-- "Bart Carny"

% After chatting a while, Colonel Tex appears and sets them off to work.
% The boys get boring jobs, not what they expected to come with being a
% carny, such as scooping up horse manure.

  Tex: All right.  Now, this geek bit is pretty straight forward.  
       You just bite the heads off the chickens and take a bow. [He hands 
       Bart and Homer chickens] Go on.  Give it a try.  Big smiles.
Homer: [through clenched teeth] Uh, Bart?
 Bart: [also through clenched teeth] Yeah, dad?
Homer: Do I like chicken?
 Bart: Does it matter?
Homer: I guess not.
-- Rehearsing the Geek Show, "Bart Carny"

% Cooder and Spud have to leave for their AA meeting, so Homer and Bart

% Cooder and Spud explain that the rings don't ever fit on the good
% prizes, and that they have to do anything to attract customers.

  Bart: Like rube?
  Spud: Now you're on the trolley!

% Later that night, Homer and Bart are on the look out for 'pigeons' to
% scam. Homer spots someone -- a sleazily dressed guy, smoking and
% shuffling cards -- definitely not a pigeon.

Hey, high pockets?  Win something for your girlfriend?
-- Bart, attracting Principal Skinner and Agnes to the ring toss game,
   "Bart Carny"

Skinner: All right, Simpson. Be honest with me. Is it actually 
         possible to win this game?
   Bart: If I like it, it is.
Skinner: Hot dog! Let's go.
-- Pigeon, "Bart Carny"

% He pays Bart and Bart hands him the rings.  Skinner throws many misses.

You're failing, Seymour. What is it about you and failure?

% Skinner has two rings left.  He thinks then decides to go for the bowie 
% knife next to the lamp.  He misses.
% Some time later, Homer places the money in the box.

 Bart: We're natural-born Carnies, dad. If only we weren't tied down 
       with a family.
Homer: Yeah. We should start our own game, where people throw ducks 
       at balloons and nothing's the way it seems.
-- An upcoming episode? "Bart Carny"

% Chief Wiggum arrives at the ring toss game.

Wiggum: Uh, I hate to interrupt your fun, boys. But, I got a few 
        complaints that your game is crooked.
 Homer: And how?
Wiggum: Gee, I hate to close you down.  Maybe we can reach a little 
        uh, understanding here.
 Homer: [monotone] I understand.
  Bart: Um, hey dad, I.. I.. think he wants..
 Homer: Not now, son. Daddy's talking to a policeman. 
Wiggum: Let me put it this way.  I'm looking for my friend, <Bill>. 
        Have you seen any <Bills> around here?
 Homer: No, he's Bart.
Wiggum: [frustrated] Listen carefully, and watch me wink as I speak, 
        okay?
 Homer: Okay.
Wiggum: The guy I'm really looking for [wink] is Mr. <Bribe>. [wink, 
        wink]
 Homer: [clueless] It's a Ring Toss game.
Wiggum: Alright, I'm shutting this game down.
-- The factious truth of Bribes, "Bart Carny"

% A tow truck hauls the game away, just as Cooder and Spud get back from

Look at them, Bart.  If a Carny can wind up homeless, it can happen to
anyone.
-- Homer, "Bart Carny"

% Feeling obligated to stick to the carny code, Homer invites the carnies

Let me get you a coaster for those feet.
-- Marge, to the carnies, "Bart Carny"

% Marge takes Homer aside, while Spud tries to impress Lisa by unhinging
% all his bodily joints at once.

 Marge: How long are those roustabouts going to be staying here?
 Homer: Oh, it won't be long. Once their resume` gets out, they'll have
        all kinds of offers. The older one can pull out his left eye.
        [An eye rolls into the kitchen scaring Marge.]
Cooder: [off-screen] Little help?
-- "Bart Carny"

% Later that night, the carnies entertain the family.

transients you've ever brought home.
-- Lisa, "Bart Carny"

% mail slot.

Tell us where the extra sheets are and get off our property.

Marge: We can't just give up on our house.  There's got to be a way 
       to get these guys out of there.
 Bart: I say we set fire to the house -- kill them that way.
Marge: We don't want to kill them, Bart. We just want our home back.
 Lisa: [thinks it over] Well...if we did set fire to the house..
Marge: No fires!
Homer: [excited] I've got it!
Marge: No fires!
Homer: Aw..
Marge: There must be a way to outsmart them.
Homer: [discouraged] Uh, you can't outsmart carnival folk.  They're
       the cleverest folks in the world.  Just look at the way they sucker
       regular folk with those crooked games. [Gasps] That's it! Fire!
       [Marge looks angry] Or..
-- F.. "Bart Carny"

% Later, OFF appear at the doorstep. Homer is carrying a hula hoop.

 Homer: [through the peep-hole Cooder is looking through] One game of
        Ring Toss.  If I can throw this hula hoop onto the chimney,
        you'll give us our house back.  If I miss, I'll sign the deed

 Marge: Homer, no!
  Bart: Aw, you'll never make it, dad!
-- Homer tries to win back his home, "Bart Carny"

% Cooder agrees and steps into the lawn to watch, leaving the front door
% ajar. Homer aims and mentally practices the throw, and the whole family
% dash into the house through the open front door, slamming it behind
% them and giving the Cooders a taste of their own medicine.

  Spud: Hey, they just ran into the house. That Homer fella gritted
        you good, dad.
Cooder: Well, there's no shame in being beaten by the best.
  Spud: But, he didn't seem..
Cooder: [angrily] We were beaten by the best, boy.
