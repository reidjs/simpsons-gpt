-- Yipes!, "The Day the Violence Died"

   Bart: You invented Itchy? The _Itchy & Scratchy_ Itchy?
Chester: Sure. In fact, I invented the whole concept of cartoon

% fun!")  "Come on, Itchy! Kill that guy!" Milhouse screams.  Milhouse
% reads the next cue card, "A chance for more mischief".  Bart laughs
% at the "fat oaf", but Milhouse tells him that it's Teddy Roosevelt.
% The cue card reads: "Ah, Manhattan Town. An agreeable sight for an
% Old Knickerbocker such as myself."  Never running out of ideas, Itchy
% grabs an axe and chops Roosevelt's head off. Covered with blood, he
