Bart:      That's the best you can do?  You could have at least said

               between their careers and their hearts.
Mrs. Flanders: Excuse me Edna, I don't think were talking about love
               here.  We're talking about S-E-X.  In front of the C-H-I-
               L-D-R-E-N.
Krusty:        Sex Cauldron!  I thought they closed that place down.
-- Keep up those spelling lessons, Krusty, "Grade School Confidential"

% Skinner asks what is going on.  Various members of the crowd respond
% tell him they heard that Skinner and Krabappel were having "sordid
% public sexual congress" in the closet.

Skinner:   This is absurd!  I did not have relations in that closet
           and the fact is I haven't ... [hesitates] um ...
Chalmers:  Yes?
Krabappel: Seymour, I think you'd better tell them.  It's the only way
           to clear our names.
Skinner:   Well, everyone, the fact is, I haven't ever had relations.
           I am a virgin.
           [the crowd is stunned]
Nelson:    Ha - ha!
Homer:     Hey, does this mean that Mrs. Krabappel is a virgin, too?
Krabappel: [offscreen] Ha!
-- Let's not push it, "Grade School Confidential"

% Superintendent Chalmers decides to back down.

Chalmers:  Well, it's clear you've been falsely accused.  Because no
           one, anywhere, ever, would pretend to be a 44-year-old
           virgin.
           [the crowd walks off]
Krusty:    Oh, that's for sure.
Hibbert:   I'm, uh, I'm inclined to agree.
Willie:    Ach!  I'll never look at him the same again.
Lenny:     That was more than I wanted to know.
Chalmers:  [clears throat] Okay, well um, Edna, Seymour, in light of
           these uh, uh, revelations, I uh, suppose we uh,
           overreacted.
Krabappel: Do we have our jobs back?
Chalmers:  What?  Oh yes, yes, sure.  Just uh, you know, keep the
           lewdness to a minimum.  [hurries off]
-- Uncompromising standards, "Grade School Confidential"

% Relieved, Skinner, Krabappel, and Bart return to the school.  Bart
% gets his things out of the locker and begins to head home.

Bart:      I'm outta here.  Skinny, Krabby, catch ya later.
Skinner:   Uh, hold on, Bart.  May we have a word with you?
Krabappel: We want to thank you for helping us through a difficult
           period.
Bart:      Oh, no problemo.  So I guess now you'll be getting married
           or something, huh?
Krabappel: Well, actually, Seymour and I have decided to break up.
Bart:      Huh?
Skinner:   Mm.  We can't continue on like this, trying to build a
           private relationship in public, the whole town watching our
           every move with a fine-toothed comb.
Krabappel: Mmm-hmm.  I'm used to humiliation but not in front of a
           crowd that size.
Bart:      Aw, but you seemed like such a good couple.
Krabappel: Bart.  When you get a little older you're going to learn
           that sometimes romances don't turn out exactly the way
           you'd like them to.
Bart:      [sighs and trudges out of the building]
Skinner:   That's why I love elementary school, Edna.  The children
           believe anything you tell them.

% Skinner produces some champagne, and he and Edna repair to the
% janitor's closet.  Before we fade to black, we hear a cork pop and the
% loving couple laugh heartily.  True love has triumphed again.
