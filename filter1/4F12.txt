% Krusty then introduces the next feature: a new Itchy & Scratchy
% cartoon, "Why Do Fools Fall in Lava?"
%
% Tourist Scratchy visits a volcano with a bungee jump, operated by a
% certain homicidal mouse.  He pays for the jump, but is shocked when
% Itchy slashes him open with a knife, ties his intestines to the
% railing, and pushes him over the edge.  Luckily, his fall is broken by
% his entrails, suspending him a few feet over the lava.  Up above,
% however, Itchy has inserted a funnel into Scratchy's intestine and is
% pouring gasoline into it.  Scratchy frantically covers his mouth to
% keep any of the flammable liquid from escaping, but eventually, his
% cheeks swell up, and Scratchy lets the gasoline burst out of his
% mouth.  He is instantly vaporized.

       Itchy.  I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish
       I would go away.  I think we got off on the wrong foot.  I know I
       can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry.  But if
       everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog
       that nobody wanted, I know we can make them laugh and cry until
       we grow old together.
-- "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show"

% "..aaand cut!"  The writers and producers applaud Homer's sentiments.
%
% Some time later, the latest "I&S&P" episode is about to air.

Now kids, I know you loved the old Poochie, but the new one is going to
be better than ten Super Bowls!  I don't want to oversell it, judge for
yourselves.
-- Homer, "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show"

% At an ice sculpture contest, Itchy begins cutting into Scratchy with a
% chainsaw.  Suddenly, Poochie wanders by.

  Itchy: Hi, Poochie.  You look like you've got something to say.  Do
         you?
Poochie: Yes, I certainly do!
         [Roger Myers' voice] I have to go now. My planet needs me.
          [the cel with Poochie on it is crudely moved upwards]
          [some crudely-scrawled titles move up, stating "Note: Poochie
          died on the way back to his home planet"]
   Bart: Wow, Poochie came from another planet?
   Lisa: Uh, I guess...
-- "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show"

% Homer is shocked to have been double-crossed.

Krusty: Poochie's dead!  [laughs]
         [children in the audience cheer loudly]
        Well kids, we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters
        die, they're back again the very next week.  That's why I'm
        presenting this sworn affidavit the Poochie will never, ever,
        _ever_ return!
Lawyer: This document conforms to all applicable laws and statutes.
         [kids cheer]
-- Never feer Poochie: The Next Generation,
      "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show"

% Bart and Lisa are cheering too, but they hide it (badly) from their
% father.

 Bart: Tough break, Dad.  I guess people just weren't ready for Poochie.
       Maybe in a few years.
  Roy: Good news, everybody. I'm moving into my own apartment with two
       sexy ladies.
Marge: Oh, then I guess this is good-bye, Roy.  Maybe we'll see you in a
       few years.
-- Until he gets his own show on Fo-ox!,
      "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show"

Well, I guess I learned my lesson.  The thing is, I lost creative
control of the project.  And I forgot to ask for any money.  Well, live
and learn.
-- Homer, no longer the money-driven workaholic he once was,
      "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show"

% Later, Bart and Lisa are in front of the tube, watching a new Itchy &
% Scratchy episode, back to its traditional form.
%
% Itchy & Scratchy are doing a William Tell act.  Scratchy is
% understandably nervous, but is relieved that the arrow strikes the
% exact middle of the apple.  Unfortunately, it pierces the tank of
% Carbolic Acid that he is standing in front of.  The acid streams out
% and instantly skeletonizes the cartoon feline.

Bart: It's back to the basics, classic "Itchy & Scratchy."
Lisa: We should thank our lucky stars that they're still putting on a
      program of this caliber after so many years.
       [they both stare at the tube for a while]
Bart: What else is on?
       [Lisa changes the channel, screen goes to static]
-- Switching to `3rd Rock'?, "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show"

% The Executive Producer credits go up over static.

% [End of Act III, Time: 21:27]
