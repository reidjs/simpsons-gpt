% The scene opens on the front of Springfield Elementary.  Principal
% Skinner enters the double doors, silhouetted.

Skinner: Ah, is there nothing so intoxicating as the school hallway at
         early morn?  [sniffs] Hmm, school normally doesn't smell so
         rank.
          [sniffs under his arm] Ah, washbasin fresh.  That funk must be
         coming from one of the classrooms.

          [sees gerbil in cage] Aw, poor fellow: crushed by his own
         waterbottle.

Skinner: Willy, some time over the holiday weekend the beloved grade
         four gerbil, uh, Superdude, lost his life.  I need you to air
         out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial.
          [Willy looks inside the box, gets a whiff]
  Willy: Gah!

         Eh, you're lucky you're getting a decent burial.  Me own father
         got thrown in the bog.

           utmost importance.  I need to send this parcel with the
           profit projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena.  And it
           absolutely, positively _has_ to be there overnight.

 Skinner: Hmm?  Oh, it's an unrelated article.
Chalmers: It's an unrelated article?
 Skinner: [nodding] Mm hmm.
Chalmers: Within the banner headline?
 Skinner: Yes.  [puts the newspaper down] Now, to redirect our
          conversation slightly, I had a few ideas on how to spend this
          oil money.
Chalmers: Well, we could give each student a full college scholarship.

 Skinner: Oh, mercy.  Seriously though...
-- No 78th-grade readers yet, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

           [sits on desk; groans as his knee bends painfully]
          Well, me and my fourth form chums think it would be quite

          plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue!
 Skinner: That hotel's a dump and your monopoly's pathetic.  This
          school's oil well is not for sale, particularly to a
          blackhearted scoundrel like yourself.
   Burns: I see.  Then I'll just have to...attack you!

Marge: I'm happy for the school.  It sounds like this money's going to
       provide a lot of new opportunities.
 Bart: Big deal.  They didn't approve my idea; they said it was
       unfeasible.
 Lisa: It _is_ unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart.  And even if the
       Three Stooges _were_ alive I doubt they'd want to hang around
       with you.
 Bart: Oh yeah.  I guess they'd probably want to be with their families
       or something, huh?
Homer: Oh, I hate my job.  I mean, what's the point when your boss
       doesn't even remember your name?
Marge: I have an idea.
Homer: What?  What's your idea?
Marge: When my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent
       her a box of candy with his photo in it.  After that, she never
       forgot him.
Homer: That's all well and good, but it's not really _your_ idea, is it

   Burns: Ah yes, I believe that's little Maggie Simpson, the baby who

          have here a polite but firm letter to Mr. Burns' underlings,
          who with some cajoling, will pass it along to him or at least
          give him the gist of it.
    Aide: [whispering] Sir, a lot of people are stroking guns.
  Quimby: Also it has been brought to my attention that a number of you
          are stroking guns.  Therefore I will step aside and open up
          the floor.
           [Smithers, unshaven and drunk, stands up]
Smithers: [crying] Mr. Burns was the closest thing I ever had to...a
          friend.  But he fired me!  And now I spend my days drinking
          cheap scotch and watching Comedy Central!
 Hibbert: Oh, dear God!
Smithers: {Ehh, it's not that bad.  I never miss "Pardon My Zinger".}

-- Weekdays at three p.m., "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

  Willy: {Burns cost me my groundskeeping job at the school.  And I'm
         too superstitious to take the one at the cemetery.}
    Abe: {Because of him, I lost my room, my things and my buddy's
         collection of old sunbathing magazines.}
Old man: {You bastard!}
    Moe: I lost my bar!
 Barney: I lost his bar!
   Lisa: He robbed the school of music!
Skinner: He robbed the school of financial security!
   Tito: He robbed the school of Tito!
  Homer: He can't remember my name!
  Marge: He's causing us all to yell!  [Maggie sucks violently]
   Bart: Look what he did to my best friend!
          [camera pans to Milhouse eating cheezies]
         No, my dog!
          [SLH rolls in on his cart]
  Burns: [chuckling] Oh, those wheels are squeaking a bit.  Perhaps I
         can sell him a little oil?
-- Uncalled-for jokes, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

% SLH growls at him.

      Bart: You twisted old monster!
             [runs at him; Burns pulls back his lapel and shows a gun]
     Burns: [scolds] I've decided to protect myself ever since I was
            attacked in my office by an unidentified assailant.
     Homer: D'oh!
McAllister: Arr.  Burns, your scurvy schemes will earn ye a one way
            passage to the boneyard...
       Ned: I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel.
       Mel: I'll see to it that Mr. Burns suffers the infernal
            machinations of hell's grim tyrant.  [flicks a switchblade]
      Otto: Yeah!
     Burns: Oh, you all talk big.  But who here has the guts to stop me?
             [camera pans across still audience]
            Mm hm.  Very well.  One last question: have you ever seen
            the sun set...at three p.m.?
McAllister: Aye, once.  When I was sailing 'round the arctic --
     Burns: Shut up, you!
-- Burns' diabolical plan unfolds, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

% "Take one last look at the sun, Springfield!" he exhorts, pressing a
% button on a remote control.  A giant shield lifts out of a mountain
% and blocks out the sun.  Burns laughs uncontrollably as it does so.
% Krusty runs up the steps to the town hall in shorts with a suitcase
% and does his trademark laugh.  "I've been in Reno for six weeks.  Did
% I miss anything?"  When he sees everyone looking aghast, he turns
% around.  Everyone starts leaving in the gloom.

Doris: Eternal darkness.  Well, that's just great.
  Apu: Listen, someone's got to get that Mr. Burns.  Where is that gun-
       toting lowlife when you need one?
Snake: Sorry, I was in the can.
-- Even criminals have to go, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

% Burns walks down the street and sighs, "Perpetual twilight, bathed in
% the glow of Burns brand electricity."  He jumps onto a lamppost and
% rhymes, "Hello, lamppost.  Whatcha knowin'?  I've come to watch
% your...power flowin'."
%
% Back at the town hall, Carl reaches for a jacket.  "That's odd," he
% remarks, "Mr. Smithers left his jacket behind."  The camera cuts back
% to an overhead view of Mr. Burns walking down the street and
% whistling.
%
% Otto, still in the Town Hall, observes, "Whoa, that's odd.  Principal
% Skinner left his mother behind."  Burns walks past a park bench
% humming.
%
% Marge loads Maggie into the station wagon.  She looks around: "That's
% odd.  Where's Homer?  And Bart?  And Lisa?  And Grampa?"  Mr. Burns is
% humming and walking down yet another street.  The camera cuts to the
% Simpson yard where the gun box sits open and empty atop a pile of
% dirt.
%
% Burns says to himself, "After all these years, things are finally
% starting to go my way.  I feel like celebrating."  He walks past the
% corner of a building; only his shadow is visible.  Suddenly, he stops
% walking.  Burns says, "I -- oh, it's you.  What are you so happy
% about?...I see.  I think you'd better drop it.  I said, drop it!"
% Some noises of Burns struggling are heard, after which he says, "Get
% your hands off!"
%
% The camera cuts back to Marge who asks, "Where is everybody?"  A
% gunshot is heard.  Burns stumbles from around a corner, gasping, a
% bullet wound on the left side of his chest.  Jimbo asks him, "Hey,
% man, are you OK?"  Burns stammers, "I won't dignify that with a
% response," then collapses on the sundial.

  Selma: Mr. Burns has been shot.
 Wiggum: Just a minute!  This isn't Mr. Burns at all!  It's a mask!
          [pulls at his face a little]
         Wait, it _is_ Burns.  Heh, his wrinkly skin, it...looks like a
         mask.
  Marge: I don't think we'll ever know who did this.  Everyone in town's
         a suspect.
Hibbert: Heh heh heh.  Well, I couldn't possibly solve this mystery.
         Can..._you_?  [points at camera]
          [camera pulls back to reveal that he's pointing at Wiggum]
 Wiggum: Yeah, I'll give it a shot, I mean, you know, it's my job,
         right?

% The music over the closing credits is somber and serious, the melody
% played by a single trumpet a la Taps (over a military drum beat).  A
% shot is heard during the Gracie Films music.
