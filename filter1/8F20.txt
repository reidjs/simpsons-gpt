% Their love bloomed.  During a visitation, Sideshow Bob asks to kiss
% Selma through the glass.  She presses her cheek against the glass (the
% cheek growing to gargantuan proportions in the process).  ``Inspired

% Sideshow Bob framed Krusty, and Sideshow Bob thanks Bart for doing so,

Sideshow Bob: Selma, would you mind if I did something bold and shocking
       in front of your family?
Selma: All right.  But no tongues. [removes her cigarette and puckers up]

% As for appetizers, Homer suggests...

Homer: You can't go wrong with cocktail weenies!  They taste as good as

Sideshow Bob: Well, Selma, he makes a good case.
-- Catering the wedding, ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

% Selma says they can get whatever they want.  ``All tastes like styrofoam

Selma: That McGyver's a genius.

Selma: [refusing to believe]  You're lying!  You're lying!
Sideshow Bob: No, Selma.  <This> is lying.

-- A critical eye, ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

Homer: I hate all the programs Marge likes, but it's no big deal.
       You know why?
Selma: No.
Sideshow Bob: Go on.
Homer: Whenever Marge turns on one of her ``non-violent'' programs,
       I take a walk.  I go to a bar, I pound a few, then I stumble

%
% Apparently, Sideshow Bob's complaining paid off.  He lights the fire,

% Sideshow Bob quickly changes the subject.  It's time to watch McGyver.
% While Selma sits in her comfy chair, Sideshow Bob carefully places a

% Patty stops by the Simpsons house, feeling somewhat lonely.  She asks

Sideshow Bob: Bart, I must know.  How did you untangle my web?
Chief Wiggum: Yeah, Bart, pull us in!
Bart:         Well, I'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do
              his job...
Chief Wiggum: No no, please.  It's the only way I'll learn.
-- ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

% Bart explains.  He realized that the reason Sideshow Bob got so frantic
% over a measly fireplace was for the natural gas.  Surely anyone would have
% smelled a gas leak---except Selma.  While she watched McGyver, the room
% filled with gas, and the spark from her post-McGyver cigarette would set
% it off.

Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.

% With a burst of flame, the Simpson-Mobile speeds off for Shelbyville.
