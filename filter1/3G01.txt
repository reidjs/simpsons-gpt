% In a dark study, Leonard Nimoy sits at a desk that has a skull, a book
% and three lit candles on it.  Behind him is a bookshelf.  A spotlight
% fades in on him.

Hello.  I'm Leonard Nimoy.  The following tale of alien encounters is
true.  And by true, I mean false.  It's all lies. But they're
entertaining lies.  And in the end, isn't that the real truth?  The
answer is: No.
-- What was the question again?, "The Springfield Files"

% "Our story begins on a Friday morning in a little town called
% Springfield." Nimoy narrates.  In his book is an illustration of a
% glad-looking Homer, which takes us into the story.  At the SNPP, Homer
% is celebrating the fact that it's Friday, and that he's off to Moe's.
% Lenny reminds him that it's 10am, but Homer has a plan of his own to
% sneak out of work.

I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to _speed_ around the city,
keeping its _speed_ over fifty.  And if its _speed_ dropped, the bus
would explode!  I think it was called... "The bus that couldn't slow
down."
-- So close, yet so far, Homer, "The Springfield Files"

% Homer carries out his plan.  He hooks up his VCR to the surveillance
% camera and puts in an ancient cassette tape of him working with Lenny
% and Carl in sector 7-G.  The result: an infinite loop of Homer, eating
% a doughnut while talking to Lenny, both dressed in 70's clothing.  In
% comes afro-wearing Carl in a hippie outfit.  A glitch in the tape
% skips to another shot of Lenny and Carl dancing while Homer sleeps.
% The awkward loop of this 5-second tape goes unnoticed by Mr. Burns,
% who chats with Smithers in his office.

Mr. Burns: So, another Friday is upon us.  What will you be doing,
           Smithers?  Something _gay_, no doubt!
 Smithers: Wha...?  What?!
Mr. Burns: You know.  Light-hearted, fancy-free.  "Mothers, lock up your
           daughters!  Smithers is on the town!"  [chuckles a bit]
 Smithers: Exactly, sir!  [laughs nervously]
-- Gotta be more careful there, Waylon, "The Springfield Files"

% At the Retirement Castle...

    Jasper: Thank God it's Wednesday.  [eats pills]
Mrs. Glick: It's Friday.  [eats pills]
    Japser: Uh-oh, wrong pills.
             [hair grows all over his body]
            Uh...  Little help?
-- God bless today's medicine, "The Springfield Files"

% At the Noiseland Arcade, Donkey Kong sits in a chair on top a stand
% holding a sign saying "Meet Donkey Kong in Person."  The Generic
% Sarcastic Middle-Aged Worker walks by, saying he's "just not a draw
% anymore."  Kong replies by throwing him a barrel.  "Hey!  He's still
% got it!" observes the man.
%
% At the arcade, Milhouse feeds the "Waterworld" video game the fourty
% quarters required to play the game.

Milhouse: [feeding quarters] 38... 39... 40 quarters.  This better be
          good.
           [presses start, walks two steps]
    Game: Game Over.  Please deposit 40 quarters.
Milhouse: What a rip!
           [hesitates a second, then deposits more quarters]
-- I bet he's seen the movie 32 times, "The Springfield Files"

% "Thank god it's Friday," says Dr. Hibbert, leaving and closing the
% hospital. Inside is a naked Hans Moleman standing behind an x-ray
% screen, left to himself.
%
% Later, a decorative living room is displayed -- but it's only in the
% "Better Homes Than Yours" magazine.  It's lying on a filthy table,
% whose garbage is being picked up by Marge, who surveys the filthy
% house.
        
Marge: [sees SLH chewing on a chair]  Bad dog!
       [sees Snowball scratching up the couch]  Bad cat!
       [sees a fawn licking something]  Bad fawn!
       [looks puzzled]
-- Bad moose, and squirrel, and elephant and three-toed sloth...,
      "The Springfield Files"

% Marge shoos away the fawn.  Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa are watching TV.

Lisa: All right!  It's time for ABC's "TGIF" lineup!
Bart: Lis, when you get a little older, you'll learn that Friday is just
      another day between NBC's "Must See Thursday" and CBS' " Saturday
      night craporama."
-- And Fox Sunday nights fit in where?, "The Springfield Files"

% At Moe's, Homer's in the mood for more excitement than his regular
% Duff. Quick thinker, Moe draws two dots above the "u", and voila:
% "Doof," direct from Sweden.  "Skoal!" shouts Homer, but he's not
% fooled for long.
%
% Moe draws back and offers him a real new brand: "Red Tick Beer."

Homer: Hmm... Bold, refreshing, and something I can't quite put my
       finger on.
        [at the Red Tick Beer brewery, dogs are swimming in the tank]
  Man: [takes a sip]  Hmm... Needs more dog.
-- Homer tries Red Tick Beer, "The Springfield Files"

% After downing quite a few...

Well, it's 1am.  Better go home and spend some quality time with the
kids.
-- Homer sets the new standard for family togetherness,
      "The Springfield Files"

% But Moe won't let him go till he takes a breathalyzer test.  Homer
% takes it, and he's not just Tipsy, not just Soused, not just Stinkin',
% but he's in the "Boris Yeltsin" level of drunkenness.  "Eh, I guess
% I'll walk home" reasons Homer.
%
% Homer wanders around and winds up in a dark, scary park full of
% leafless trees.  Homer's startled by the howling dogs.  Suddenly,
% "Psycho" music starts to play as a bus pulls up, its headlights
% glaring at Homer.  The chilling violin is being played by the musical
% passengers aboard the "Springfied Philharmonic" bus.  The bus speeds
% off, dropping off a lone violinist, who continues to play the eerie
% music.
%
% Terrified, Homer starts to aimlessly run.  He stops before a billboard
% that says "DIE."  Homer shreaks.  The wind blows away the tree that
% covered the last word.  Nonetheless, a "DIET" sign still scares Homer
% witless.  Homer runs into the woods and runs into Grampa, who was
% hiding in the bushes.

Grampa: Oh son, I'm glad to see you!  I went for the morning paper and I
        got lost!  And...
 Homer: No time for you, old man!
         [pushes Grampa aside]
-- Don't interrupt a man in the middle of a cowardice panic,
      "The Springfield Files"

% Homer plows through a mess of branches and plants and runs across a
% log in the middle of the misty night.  For effect, an owl hoots. Homer
% trips over a branch.  (For more effect, the chilling music most
% associated with "The X-Files" begins to play)  What he sees before him
% is an eerie, green glowing figure with a large bulbous head, enormous
% dark eyes and a contorted, spindly body.

Homer: Please!  Don't hurt me!
Alien: [gentle voice] Don't be afraid.
Homer: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!
        [begins running through the field of grass, creating a
        handwritten writing of "Yahhh!" in the grass]
-- Your typical alien encounter, "The Springfield Files"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 5:21]
%
% Homer busts through the door of his bedroom, panting, awakening Marge.

Marge: Homer, it's 2 am.  What happened?
Homer: It was an alien, Marge!  It appeared in front of me and said
       "Don't be Afraid."
Marge: [waving her hand in front her nose]  Have you been drinking?
Homer: No!  Well, ten beers.
-- Ticks'll do that to you, "The Springfield Files"

% Homer tells his unbelieveable tale at the breakfast table.

Homer: I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet.
 Lisa: Maybe you just dreamed it.
Homer: Oh yeah?  Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky,
       translucent goo.  Explain that!
Marge: [serves him] More sausage?
        [Homer starts drooling]
-- Occam's Razor to its gruesomest, "The Springfield Files"

 Lisa: Dad, according to "Junior Skeptic Magazine," the chances are 175
       million to one of another form of life actually coming in contact
       with ours.
Homer: So?
 Lisa: It's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are
       always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs.  Oh, and you, Dad.
       [nervous laugh]
-- Once a skeptic, always a skeptic, "The Springfield Files"

% Bart, "The Thing, from Uranus," greets the family dressed in novelty
% spring goggles, a bike helmet with antennaes on top and a black shirt
% while holding a water soaker, making light of Homer's supposed alien
% encounter.

Homer: [gasps, then realizes] Oh, it's Bart.  I can't believe it.  I'm
       being mocked.  By my own children.  On my birthday.
 Bart: It's your birthday?
Homer: Yes!  Remember, it's the same day as the dog's.
 Lisa: Santa's Little Helper, it's your birthday?  Ooh!  We've gotta get
       you a present.  [cuddling him]  Yes we do!  Yes we do!
 Bart: [cuddling him]  We love you boy.
Marge: [cuddling him]  Good doggie.  Good doggie.
        [Maggie joins in, leaving Homer alone at the table]
Homer: Lousy loveable dog.
-- Yet with an untwistable stomach, "The Springfield Files"

% Homer tells his unbelieveable tale at the SNPP.

Oh, it was awful!  They set me on a cold, metal table.  Then prodded me
with humiliating probes, and then...  Oh wait, that was my physical.
-- From `The X Files' to `General Hospital', "The Springfield Files"

% At the police station, Homer tells his unbelieveable tale to Chief
% Wiggum.

 Homer: The alien has a sweet, heavenly voice... like Urkel!  And he
        appears every Friday night... like Urkel!
Wiggum: Well, your story is _very_ compelling, Mr. Jackass, I mean, uh,
        Simpson.  So, I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter!
         [Wiggum raises his arms and starts typing on air in sarcasm]
         [starts humming]
 Homer: You don't have to humiliate me.
         [Homer walks off, and another man walks in, wearing slightly
         burned clothes and playing compulsively with a lighter]
   Man: I just torched a building downtown, and I'm afraid I'll do it
        again!
Wiggum: Oh, yeah, right.  I'll just type it up on my invisible
        typewriter!
         [goes through the same sarcastic routine]
        Fruitcake!
-- Why _do_ you wear that badge, anyway? "The Springfield Files"

% We are then taken to the F.B.I. Division of Paranormal Activites.
% Inside the office, there is a picture of J. Edgar Hoover in a lady's
% dress, joined by other spooky pictures.  An attractive red-head is
% working at her computer.  Her attractive, brown-haired partner shows
% her a paper about Homer's alleged alien encounter.

Mulder: There's been another unsubstantiated UFO sighting in the
        Heartland of America.  We've gotta get there right away.
Scully: Well... gee, Mulder, there's also this report of a shipment of
        drugs and illegal weapons coming into New Jersey tonight.
Mulder: [scoffs] I hardly think the FBI is concerned with matters like
        that.
-- That's for overpaid, obese policemen with invisible typewriters,
      "The Springfield Files"

% At the Simpsons home, Mulder gives a slight knock on the front door.
% Marge answers, and panics at the sight of F.B.I. agents, thinking
% they're after her for the pen she took from the Post Office.  Swearing
% she didn't know it was in her purse, and that she was about to bring
% it back when the dog chewed it up, she starts hyperventilating. Mulder
% informs her that their matter is with Homer.  Still panting, Marge
% greets them in.
%
% At the FBI Springfield Branch, Mulder and Scully tell Homer to pick
% out from a lineup the alien that he saw.  But Marvin the Martian,
% Gort, Chewbacca, ALF and Kang (or is it Kodos?) don't fit the bill.

Oh, this makes me very angry!
-- Marvin, the clicheic, Martian, "The Springfield Files"

% The Cigarette Smoking Man in the shadows watches Mulder and Scully
% conduct a polygraph test on Homer.

Scully: Now, we're going to run a few tests.  This is a simple lie
        detector.  I'll ask you a few yes or no questions and you just
        answer truthfully.  Do you understand?
 Homer: Yes.
         [the polygraph explodes]
-- It worked, all right, "The Springfield Files"

% Scully tests Homer's reflexes.  It takes quite a while before Homer
% feels the pain and says "Oww."
%
% Later, with wires attached to him, Homer runs on a treadmill in naught
% but his underwear.  Mulder and Scully watch.

Mulder: Wait a minute, Scully.  What's the point of this test?
Scully: No point.  I just thought he could stand to lose a little
        weight.
Mulder: His jiggling is almost hypnotic.
Scully: Yes.  It's like a lava lamp.
-- "The Springfield Files"

% Mulder amd Skully then take their investigation to Moe's.

Mulder: All right, Homer.  We want you to re-create your every move the
        night you saw this alien.
 Homer: Well, the evening began at the gentleman's club, where we were
        discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.
Scully: Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the F.B.I.
 Homer: We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard.  You
        happy?
-- "The Springfield Files"

% Homer later makes himself as drunk as he was before and begins to make
% a pass at Scully.

_You_ are one fine looking woman, lady.  If I wasn't married, I'd go out
with you like _that_!
 [hits his bottle on the bar; beer bubbles and spills out the bottle]
I am _so_ sorry!  Whatever you do, don't tell Marge!  God, I love her!
I... hey!  A penny!
 [leaps into the floor]
-- Homer recreates his every move (and bottle), "The Springfield Files"

% Scully and Mulder introduce themselves to Moe at his request, and
% their FBI credentials alarm Moe, who orders the men in the backroom
% watering a disgruntled killer whale to take him back to Sea World.
%
% Homer, meanwhile, continues to waste the bored FBI agents' time.

So, I says, blue M&M, red M&M, they all wind up the same color in the
end.
-- Homer's answers to life's greatest mysteries, "The Springfield Files"

% Scully invites Homer to lead them to his next location on the night of
% his encounter.  The three wind up in the park.  Homer points to the
% woods where the creature emerged; just at that moment, there's
% rustling in a bush.  All gasp, and Scully cocks a gun, fearing the
% worst.  To their (somewhat) relief, Grampa emerges in his tattered
% clothes.

Grampa: For the love of god, help me!  I've been here for four days and
        that turtle's got all of my teeth!
        [looking down]  There he is!
         [the turtle walks away, holding the oversized denture]
Grampa: [running as slowly as the turtle]  Come back here, you!  Slow
        down!  I'll get you!
Scully: This is the worst assignment we've ever had.
Mulder: Worse than the time we were attacked by the flesh-eating virus?
Grampa: [gets bitten by the turtle]  Oww!  It bit me with my own teeth!
Scully: No, this is much more irritating.
-- "The Springfield Files"

% Scully decides she's seen enough, and leaves.  Mulder's about to
% follow, but stops to deliver a speech.

But somewhere out there, something is watching us.  There are alien
forces acting in ways we can't perceive.  Are we alone in the universe?
Impossible.  When you consider the wonders that exist all around us...
 [it's nighttime now, and everyone's left Mulder alone in the park]
...voodoo priests of Haiti, the Tibetan numerologists of Appalachia, the
unsolved mysteries of -- "Unsolved Mysteries."  The truth is out there.
-- Mulder, as skeptic as we know him, "The Springfield Files"

% Behind him, Moe and the two men are hauling away the killer whale.

Oh, who thought a whale could be so heavy?!  [sees Mulder]  Cheese it!
The feds!
-- Moe, "The Springfield Files"

% Homer talks to Marge in bed.

Homer: Oh Marge, I never felt so alone.  No one believes me.  [pause]
       Uh, this is the part where you're suppose to say "I Believe You,
       Homer"?
Marge: I don't believe you, Homer.
Homer: You do??  Oh, Marge, you've made me so happy!
Marge: Hmm, you're not listening.  You're only hearing what you wanna
       hear.
Homer: Thanks!  I'd love an omelette right about now.
-- "The Springfield Files"

% Marge tries to wake him up.

Marge: I try to be supportive, but this has gone too far!  Please, just
       let it be?
Homer: No, I can't.  This is my cause.  I'm like the man who
       singlehandedly built the rocket and went to the moon.  What was
       his name?  Apollo Creed?
-- How long before he cries `Adrienne!', "The Springfield Files"

% Insulted by Marge's lack of trust for him, Homer leaves the bedroom,
% and sulks at the breakfast table.  Bart comes in.

 Bart: Hey, Dad.  What's the word with Planet Crackpot?
Homer: Oh, I suppose _you're_ going to mock me, too!
 Bart: Well, actually, Dad... I believe you.
Homer: You do?
 Bart: Yes, I do.  You seem so damn sure.
Homer: Thank you, son.  And do you think you can stop the casual
       swearing?
 Bart: Hell yes.
Homer: That's my boy.
-- Darn right, "The Springfield Files"

Homer: This Friday, we're going back to the woods and we're going to
       find that alien!
 Bart: What if we don't?
Homer: We'll fake it, and sell it to the Fox network.
 Bart: [chuckles]  They'll buy _anything_.
Homer: Now, son, they do a lot of quality programming, too.
        [the two bust up laughing]
       I kill me.
-- Make sure there's no wristwatch this time, "The Springfield Files"

% Out in the woods --again-- the three "Budweizer" frogs get eaten by a
% crocodile, who grunts "Coors."  Not far away, Bart and Homer camp out
% with an assortment of Ned Flanders' belongings.

 Bart: Hey, Dad, can I have a sip of your beer?
Homer: Now, son, you don't want to drink beer.  That's for daddies and
       kids with fake IDs.
-- "The Springfield Files"

% Homer suggests a ghost story instead.  Later that night, lit with a
% flashlight, Bart completes his chilling tale: "...and that is how much
% college will cost for Maggie."  Homer screams in denial.
%
% Later, Homer and Bart roast up some marshmallows, enjoying the great
% time they're having together.
%
% That "X-Files" music starts up again, and the green glow floats
% through the trees.  Homer recognizes his encounter.

Alien: I bring you peace.
Homer: As a representative of the planet Earth, let me just say [gets
       his foot in the camp fire]  Baaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!
       [tries to beat out the fire]  Oww!!  Oww!!
-- And we really mean it, "The Springfield Files"

% The alien runs away in fear.  Homer mourns his lost proof, but Bart
% cheers him up by saying he's taped the whole thing.  Homer and Bart
% jump up and down in joy, their jumping frozen into an illustration
% that takes us back to Leonard Nimoy in the study.

   Nimoy: And so, from this simple man came the proof that we are not

   Nimoy: Oh.  Uh, fine.  Let me, uh, just get something out of my car.
