% suggests a romantic place for OFF to dine.
% The Simpsons celebrate at the "Up, Up, And Buffet" restaurant,
% which serves its customers in an airline setting, complete with children 
% running about noisily.  Homer bumps his head on the overhead compartment,
% spilling plastic utensils all over both his head and the floor.

Pilot: [over PA] Okay, folks, this is your pilot speaking.  If you look to
       the left side of the aircraft, you will see Homer and Marge Sampson,
       who are celebrating with us today their eleventh air-niversary, heh,
       heh.  So hang on, while we dip our wings to this happy couple.
       [The plane starts to shake, causing general chaos on board.  Outside,

Pilot: Hey Jose, easy up, huh?
 Jose: Sorry.  We were only hired to park cars.

% While the kids seem to be enjoying themselves, Marge looks sadly out
% the window towards The Gilded Truffle, where a young couple sit next to the
% window, enjoying a romantic dinner.  Later, at home, Marge sticks an "Arf

Marge: Well, maybe our next anniversary will be more romantic.  Aww, look,

Homer: You mean there's been cake in our freezer for eleven years?  Why was
       I not informed?
-- "Natural Born Kissers"

Marge: Look at this little plastic couple.  Hmm, so full of hopes,

% intimate.
% The two finally give up and come out from undneath the covers, at which

Homer: He's the best boy!
Marge: Oh, yes he is!  Yes he is!

Homer: Good night!
-- An odd conversation after failing to be intimate, "Natural Born Kissers"

% reaching the kitchen.

Marge: Homer, don't look!
Homer: What?  Aaah!  The food!
       [Homer sees food all over the floor, scattered about the shallow

       screams.]
Homer: Why did this happen?  Why?!
-- "Natural Born Kissers"

 Lisa: Someone left the freezer door open and the motor burned out.  We can
       get a new one.
Homer: Okay.  It was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor.
       Plus, I've just fallen on my back, which hurt more than I let on.
-- "Natural Born Kissers"

% Driving a country road, Homer and Marge sit in the car uneasily.

Marge: When we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our
       Saturdays?  Driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator 
       motor?
Homer: Eh, I never thought I'd live this long.
-- "Natural Born Kissers"

% Over the car radio, a commercial airs.

Folks, is your marriage stuck in a rut?  Can you even remember the last

% Marge switches off the radio.  She points to a dirt road, letting Homer
% know that it's their turn.  Homer notices it a bit late, and turns sharply
% onto it, getting his wheels stuck in the mud.  He hits the gas, sending
% mud flying behind the car.
% He floors it again, sending mud all over the back window.  He does it
% again, at which point the car begins sinking in the mud.  He does it again,
% prompting Marge to yell "Homer!".

% Meanwhile, at the Retirement Castle, Bart and Lisa listen to one of
% Abraham's stories.

And that's why today, bananas are called 'yellow fatty beans'. Questions?
-- Grampa, "Natural Born Kissers"

Bart: When are Mom and Dad coming back?
 Abe: Bored, are ya?  Lisa, go cut me a switch.
Bart: There's gotta be something to do around here.  Hey, are they pulling

 Abe: Nope, everybody's paid up.
-- Top ten signs you're living in a crooked nursing home, "Natural Born

% Back in the country, Homer and Marge walk up the road.  Dark clouds
% begin forming, however, and rain begins to fall.  The two hide out in a 
% barn, and climb a ladder onto the upper level, where they rest in a hay
% loft.

Marge: Safe at last.
Homer: Shh!  We're trespassing!  And some of these farmers have pitchforks!
-- I saw it on TV once, "Natural Born Kissers"

% This particular farmer, from inside his house, notices that some of his 
% animals have escaped.  He calls to them by name.
% The man grabs his lantern and double barrel shotgun (with a pitchfork
% bayonet) and goes toward the barn to investigate.  Seeing the door open,
% he checks inside.

If somebody's in here, you're in for some serious ass forkin'!
-- A farmer's threats, "Natural Born Kissers"

% After searching around the barn for a bit, the farmer sticks his pitchfork 
% through the bottom of the hay loft, ramming it just inches from Marge's 
% waist.  The farmer gives up, and leaves for his media room.
% Having nearly been caught up there, Homer and Marge are excited.
% The two see this as reason enough to...er, "Rock the Casbah" there in
% the barn.  A cow watches from outside through a hole in the wall, and
% 'moos' with interest.

[End of act one.]

% Act two.  Homer repairs the refrigerator and pushes it back into place,
% and Marge and Homer begin kissing and laughing.  Bart and Lisa walk in.

 Lisa: Hey, public display!
 Bart: Yeah, what's with the love thang?
Marge: Let's just say the country air did us good.
       [A crowd of people, presumably the studio audience, say "Ooooh!" in

-- Betcha didn't see that one coming, "Natural Born Kissers"

% Later, Bart uses the metal detector in the backyard, while Lisa shovels
% dirt into a metal strainer.
% After experiencing a short daydream involving pirates burying treasure,
% Bart hears the detector beep on a spot on the ground, and Lisa goes to work 
% digging.

Bart: Okay, here's the deal.  Crowns and dubloons are mine, snuff boxes and

-- Ah, memories, "Natural Born Kissers"

% Homer takes off his shirt, and a maid bursts in catching him topless.

% covers his nipples with teacups from a nearby table.

 Maid: I'm so sorry!  I saw everything. [walks out, closes door]
Marge: My heart's beating like crazy!
Homer: Mine too!  Just like back in that hayloft.

-- [shudder] "Natural Born Kissers"

% Downstairs, Marge and Homer make love behind a curtain near a table,
