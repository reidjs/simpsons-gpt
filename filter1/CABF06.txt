% show.

Al:		Pigskin Preview:  Denver-Green Bay -- Who do you 
		like?
Jerry:		That's football, right?  [the trio laughs] Well, I'm 
		going to take the Broncos in this game, because the 
		Packers will be blinded by Jerry's tie.  [more 
		laughter]
Homer:		Heh-heh-heh.  Tremendous
Al:		I'm more worried about Al's jacket.  [it is indeed a 
		loud jacket, with a checkerboard pattern] How many 
		stations can you get on that thing?
Wardrobe Mgr.:	[walks into camera view] All right, listen.  I am 
		sick of your jokes about the wardrobe.  You people 
		can dress yourselves!  [walks away]
Third Man:	[ahem] Well, folks, he's got a point, um, with all 
		our unscripted horseplay, we sometimes don't think 
		about ...
Homer:		[on the phone] Lenny!  Are you watching this?
Lenny:		[on the phone] Yeah, they really hurt that guy's

Homer:		I know!

% The Pigskin Preview is cut short when Marge and Lisa walk in.

Marge:	Ready for the circus, Homer?
Homer:	Circus?
	[words in <angle brackets> should be read in heavy French 
	accent]
Lisa:	<Le Cirque de Pureé.>  We've had tickets since 
	<Septembre>.
Homer:	But I want to watch Brett <Favre>.
Marge:	Come on, Homer.  They're only in town for eight months -- 
	then they're gone.
	[on TV, the Pigskin Preview guys laugh it up again]
Homer:	Oh, I missed one of Jerry's zingers!  Now I'll never catch 
	up.
-- It's like missing your favorite soap opera, "Skinner's Sense
   of Snow"

% Homer exchanges his "TV Sports" pennant for one reading, "French
% Circus" -- and that's where the family goes.

Marge:	Finally, a circus full of whimsy and wonder.
Homer:	Oh, yeah, that's way better than fun and excitement.
Lisa:	[reading from a pamphlet] As French-Canadians, they don't 
	believe in refunds or exploiting animals for 
	entertainment.
Homer:	Oh, I wanted to seem them fire a gorilla out of a cannon.
-- That's on "Pigskin Preview," actually, "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% The family takes their seats near ringside.  An usher bids the
% family to enjoy the show, "for one day, we shall die."
%
% The show itself is less grave.  Acrobats perform to colored lights
% and whimsical music.  Suddenly, a clown with a pushcart interrupts
% the show.

Clown:	Wait, wait!  <Attendéz!>  I cannot get the lid of my jar 
	of rainbows.  Who will help me?  [points to a man in a 
	double-breasted suit] You, sir!
Man:	[heavy French-Canadian accent] But I cannot help you, I am 
	just a local merchant from ... this town.
Homer:	[yelling from the audience] Just smash it open!
Clown:	Oh, you can do it if your heart is pure -- or purée.
	[audience laughs]
	[the man opens the jar, and rainbow-colored light appears 
	to spill from it.  The man, who is suspended on wires, is 
	lifted up and "flies" around the tent as more whimsical 
	music plays]
Marge:	They always pick the guy with the wires.
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Later, Marge watches the female acrobats perform difficult
% contortionist tricks.  The exotic positions give her ideas ... on
% how to clean the bathroom.  Other acrobats, dressed in gray
% leotards, form an elephant which rears up on its hind "legs."  Marge
% declares the circus "hauntingly beautiful."  Not from Homer's
% vantage point, it isn't.  A juggler wearing very tight pants has his
% personal region right in Homer's face.
%
% Suddenly, the wind kicks up and peels back a roof panel from the
% tent.

Sideshow Mel:	A storm is coming!  I can feel it in my bone.
Ringmaster:	Mesdames and Messieurs, it appears the cloud goddess 
		is ripe with rain babies.  We must run for our 
		trucks.
		[the audience runs for the exits]
Homer:		Oh, no, you don't!  I paid full price for this freak 
		show.  Now, nourish the child within me.  
		[threateningly, with raised fist] Nourish!
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% But the tent blows away, precluding further argument.  Some of the
% acrobats form a kite to ride away on the wind, but they get blown
% into a tree instead.
%
% The radio weatherman says the storm comes from a classic nor'easter
% meeting a classic "southwester."  The rain is predicted to turn to
% snow, so Bart is hopeful school will be cancelled.  Lisa notices the
% Sea Captain is hunkered down, but in reality he was tied up by rowdy
% teenagers.
%
% The next day, Bart and Lisa listen to radio, hoping for a school
% closure.

Announcer:	The following schools are closed today:  
		Shelbyville, Ogdenville, Ogdenville Tech, and 
		Springfield Elementary ... [Bart gasps] My Dear 
		Watson Detective School
Bart:		[groans]

Bart + Lisa:	[groan]
Announcer:	And it's open season on savings at Springfield 
		Menswear ... which is closed.
Bart:		Oh, everyone's off but us.
Marge:		Oh, stop.  Your father and I don't get the day off.
Homer:		[runs by the kitchen doorway] Lenny says we got the 
		day off!  Yippee!  [runs outside]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Homer runs out to make a snow angel.  He's disappointed when it once
% again becomes a snow devil, with pitchfork and horns.
%
% His disappointment pales next to the kids, who have to endure a
% wildly out-of-control bus ride on Springfield's icy streets.  To
% Bart, it looks like everyone in the world has a snow day but the
% students.  The luckier townspeople frolic in the park.  Wiggum
% writes his name in the snow, apparently using the time-honored
% method employed by men and boys everywhere.  He asks Lou to "shake
% out the last few drops," and Lou does so -- as we learn that Wiggum
% was really "writing" with a thermos full of coffee.
%
% The student population is sparse enough that day for Skinner to
% consolidate them into one room.  The principal addresses his captive
% audience.

Skinner:	Children, I'm proud of you.  Most of our students 
		didn't bother to show up on this last day before 
		Christmas Break, but you've kept intact my Cal 
		Ripken-like streak of school openage.
Milhouse:	Hey, where are the teachers?
Skinner:	Eh, their union has called an emergency caucus.
		[cut to a ski lodge, where the teachers form a conga 
		line]
Teachers:	[conga rhythm] Caucus, caucus, caucus!  Caucus, 
		caucus, caucus!
Skinner:	But we'll have the last laugh on those Johnny-come-
		notlies.  We're going to watch my favorite movie 
		about a grinchy little character who tries to steal 
		Christmas.
		[pulls down a projector screen]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Don't get your hopes up, kids.  Skinner's talking about, "The
% Christmas That Almost Wasn't But Then Was," a black-and-white film
% from the 30s.  It starts out with Santa Claus consulting with what's
% obviously a stuffed reindeer.

Santa:		Ho, ho, ho!  What's that, Blitzen?  Why, yes, it is 
		Christmas Eve.
Elf:		I'm happy.
		[three little people wearing fake-y make-up burst 
		through the front door]
		[gasps] It's the Christmas hobgoblins!

Skinner:	[laughs] It's classic mirth-making, is what it is.

% The movie drags on.  A Christmas hobgoblin serenades Little Bo Peep.

Hobgoblin:	[singing]
		I will always love you,
		I will always be true,
		Spend my days pitching woo,
		                to you.
Milhouse:	Oh, he's been singing for two hours.
Lisa:		This couldn't have less to do with Christmas.  And I 
		think that's a stagehand.
		[in the movie, a man walks on set, and then quickly 
		backs off]
Bo Peep:	And I love you, too.
		And you and you and you,
		Oh, you and me,
		Together we can see ...
		[the film breaks, thankfully]
Nelson:		Ha-ha!  Next time, get a DVD.
Skinner:	This *is* a DVD.
		[ejects a flaming DVD from the projector, and stamps 
		it out]

-- Principal Skinner, "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% The kids run out of the classroom, but don't get far.  The school is

% The storm has brought the phone lines down, so it looks like Skinner
% and the kids are stuck at the school.  The students lament their

		Eskimo.
Skinner:	I don't care if you're Kristi Yamaguchi.  No one

% Homer and Flanders plan to rescue the children from the snowbound

% attached to the front serving as a plow blade.

	sawed off my roof.
Homer:	My car, your roof; it's only fair.
Ned:	But it's my car.
Homer:	Well, yeah.

Homer:	I never had a snowplow business.

% break for it on his bike, but he bounces off the snowdrift that has
% piled up at the outside cafeteria door.  (The bike continues
% bouncing around the cafeteria.)  The failed attempt doesn't
