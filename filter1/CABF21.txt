% Having just come home from the supermarket, Marge enthusiastically
% puts away the groceries.  There's fruit roll-ups for Bart, beer
% roll-ups for Homer, and Burly paper towels for Marge.  But wait --
% that's not her usual brand.  Marge is about to take them back to the
% store when she notices Burly's rugged lumberjack mascot.  The towels
% are pretty good, too, capable of absorbing many times their weight
% in liquid.  Marge just has to spread the word.  She picks up the
% phone and dials.

Lisa:	[runs into the kitchen] I came home as quick as I could.  
	What's going on?
Marge:	Watch what happens when I spill this blue liquid.  [pours 
	some liquid on the kitchen table, tears a towel off the 
	roll]
Lisa:	You pulled me out of school for this?
Marge:	Absolutely.  You're about to get a lesson -- in value.
-- Marge the home-schooler, "The Blunder Years"

% Marge tears a small piece off the towel and lays it on the spill. 
% It absorbs all the liquid.  She insists that Lisa spill something
% else so she can further demonstrate the towel's soaking power.  Lisa
% reluctantly spills some milk, which the towel absorbs.

Ooh, Burly, you're insatiable!
-- Marge Simpson, "The Blunder Years"

% Later, Marge has collected several more rolls of Burly paper towels. 
% She stares at the Burly lumberjack, longing for someone as manly, as
% opposed to her own husband, who comes unglued when a bee whizzes
% past his ear.  Even when she's hugging Homer, Marge thinks about
% Burly.

Burly:	Fantasize, Marge.  Fantasize about Burly.  [does a few 
	pelvic thrusts]
Homer:	Hey, you're looking at that spokesjack.  Well, I can 
	fantasize, too.  [looks at some of the other groceries] 
	Ooh, Mama Celeste.  [lustful growl]
Mama:	[brandishing a pizza cutter] You touch-a me, and I cut 
	you.
Homer:	[casts his gaze on a bottle of Newman's Own dressing]
	Hmm ...
Newman:	Homer, I'll tell you what I told Redford:  It ain't gonna 
	happen.
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Marge types a fan letter for the Burly man, asking for a signed
% photograph.  After she leaves, Homer examines the typewriter ribbon
% and finds out what Marge was writing.  Feeling betrayed, he vows to
% get back at her.
%
% Later, Marge answers the phone.

Marge:	Hello?
	[cut to Homer and Bart, who are on the other end of the 
	line.  They're in another house with a window overlooking 
	the Simpson home]
Bart:	[pinching his nose shut to disguise his voice] We have a 
	person-to-person call for Marge Simpson.
Marge:	[impressed] Person-to-person?
Homer:	[takes phone, disguises voice] Hello, this is Chad 
	Sexington, the model for Burly towels.
Marge:	[gasps] How did you get my number?
Homer:	I don't know, but I was quite moved by your letter.  I'd 
	love to meet you and your family; shall we say, dinner?
Marge:	Oh, my goodness--
Homer:	Perfect.  I'll be there at seven.  [hangs up]
	[he and Bart high-five]
Marge:	Oh, my God.  Dinner with Burly.
	[cut to Homer and Bart, laughing.  The camera pulls back 
	to reveal that Homer is in Ned's house.  Also, Ned is 
	there, entertaining guests]
Ned:	Playing a prank-er-oo, eh?
Homer:	I was having a private conversation with my wife, in the 
	guise of Chad Sexington.  Do you mind?
-- Nosy Ned butts in again, "The Blunder Years"

% Homer continues to prime Marge for the big prank.

Homer:	So, how was your day?  Did anything unbelievable happen?  
	Phone calls, things of that nature?
Marge:	You're not going to believe it.  That paper towel 
	lumberjack is coming here.  For dinner!  Tonight!
Homer:	Tonight?  Well, you'd better get your hopes up!
Marge:	I will.  [walks away]
	[Homer and Bart laugh and exchange another high-five]
-- "The Blunder Years"

% So, Marge gets ready for the big dinner party with Chad.  She's
% artfully arranged stacks of Burly paper towels throughout the house. 
% Candles are lit for that romantic and sophisticated mood.  Everyone
% is dressed up.  Marge has even painted a portrait of Chad in his
% lumberjack outfit.  For a crowning touch, when the doorbell rings,
% Bart unfurls a roll of paper towels in the hallway, for that "white
% carpet" treatment.

Homer:	Why look, it's Chad Sexington!  [opens the door.  Barney 
	is standing there, in a lumberjack outfit]
Barney:	Hey, baby!  I'm that guy you like.
Marge:	Barney?  Wh -- where's Chad?
	[Homer and Bart laugh uproariously]
	Congratulations, I feel ridiculous.  [sadly walks away]
Barney:	You mean, I was just a prop in some cruel joke?  [groans 
	and leaves]
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Lisa worries that her father may have taken the prank too far.  "It
% was hard on me, too," Homer says, "I had to wear a suit!"  He does
% see the light, though, and to make it up to Marge, he takes her (and
% the rest of the family) to the Pimento Grove for dinner and a show.

Marge:	I guess it was a pretty funny prank.  I like the ones 
	where nothing catches on fire.
Homer:	Yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings.
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Judith Owens, the night's musical entertainer, finishes up her set. 
% The emcee introduces the next act, Mesmerino the Hip Hypnotist who
% has been seen on programs like "The Michael Douglas Show," and "Art
% Linkletter's House Party."  Mesmerino emerges from a pyramid that
% has been brought onstage.

Mesmerino:	Thank you, thank you very much, ladies and 
		gentlemen.  [scans the audience] Let's see, who do 
		we have here ... [spots Prof. Frink] Well, what's 
		the matter with you, champ?  You couldn't find a 
		date?
Frink:		I didn't come here to be heckled and spoofed and 
		whatnot.
Mesmerino:	Well, why did you come here?  [dangles a hypno-coin 
		in front of Frink] Seriously, though, when I snap my 
		fingers, my friend, you will be a ... make-out 
		artist!  [snaps fingers]
Frink:		[trying futilely to resist the change] Glaven!  
		That's too powerful ... oh hey, whoa! ... hold it, 
		cause it's different ... I, ooh!
		[suddenly, Frink is a changed man.  His hair is 
		slicked back, and he talks with a confident, 
		Sinatra-like voice.  A pretty waitress walks by]
		Hey, cupcake, listen good -- I want you to swallow 
		that gum and meet me in the coat room in five, four, 
		three, two ... now.
Waitress:	[swallows the gum she's been chewing] Whatever you 
		say, Professor.
		[audience applauds]
Mesmerino:	And back you go!  [snaps fingers]
Frink:		[tries to resist again] Ooh, hey!  No, no, don't 
		make me ... I don't wanna go back to the nothin' ... 
		I don't ... n'hey ... [back to normal] Oh dear, I've 
		re-dorkulated.
		[audience applauds again]
-- That waitress is in for quite a surprise, then, "The Blunder Years"

% Next, the Don Rickles of hypnotism turns his attention to Smithers
% who (naturally) is sitting with Mr. Burns.

Mesmerino:	Hey, smart move, four-eyes.  Sittin' next to 
		Skeletor here makes you look like Hercules.
Homer:		[laughs heartily] Zing!  [aside to Lisa] What's a 
		Skeletor?
Mesmerino:	No, no, I kid.  But seriously, it's very nice to see 
		a young man take his father out for a night of 
		hypnotism -- before he dies!  [laughter]
Smithers:	Uh, actually, my father died a long time ago.  
		[collective "aw" from the audience]
Mesmerino:	Okay, is anyone here not a downer?  Anyone?
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Homer enthusiastically volunteers to be a hypnotism subject. 
% Mesmerino uses a hypno-coin to put him under.

Homer:		[monotone] I am in your power.  Boss me around.
Mesmerino:	When I snap my fingers, you will transform into a 
		... famous historian!  [snaps fingers]
Homer:		Look at me!  I'm a famous historian!  Out of my way!  
		[applause]
Mesmerino:	Thank you.  Now you are ... Emily Dickenson!  [snap]
Homer:		Look at me!  I'm Angie Dickenson!  [runs around in 
		circles]
-- Ooh, do e. e. cummings next!  "The Blunder Years"

% For his next feat of hypnotic power, Mesmerino tells Homer he is
% himself, when he was twelve years old.  Homer immediately begins
% reliving his childhood, spending his days with his friends at the
% old swimming hole.  Then, things suddenly go downhill.  Homer begins
% screaming uncontrollably.  Worse yet, Mesmerino can't bring him out
% of it, not even with repeated snaps of his finger.  They hypnotist
% scrambles into his pyramid and scuttles offstage.
%
% Homer continues screaming as he leaves the nightclub.  And as he
% tips the valet.  And as he drives home.  And as he brushes his
% teeth.  And while lying in bed that night.  And as we go to
% commercial ...
%
% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:59]
%
% And as Marge finishes up ironing Bart's clothes.  Lenny and Carl
% wheel Homer up to the house on a dolly.  They have brought him home
% because Homer's screaming has disrupted his coworkers' naptime.

Bart:	Oh, cool, he's still mental.
Carl:	Yeah.  My hunch is he's struggling with some sort of 
	repressed memory.
Marge:	Hmm.  How do we un-repress it?
Lisa:	Well, the Yaqui Indians brew a special tea that unlocks 
	memories.
Marge:	It would be a good excuse to use my Yaqui tea set.
-- Any excuse is a good one, "The Blunder Years"

% So everyone sits down to a nice batch of Yaqui tea.

Marge:	Well?  Is anything coming back to you?
Homer:	Ah, heh-heh.  There have been so many classic Simpson 
	moments.  I remember the time I tried to jump over 
	Springfield Gorge.
	[dissolve to a clip from "Bart the Daredevil (7F06)"]
	I'm going to make it!
Lisa:	[voice-over] No, Dad, everyone's sick of that memory.
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Lisa encourages her father to try to remember back when he was
% twelve.  Homer remembers going hiking, coincidentally enough with
% Lenny and Carl.  To kill the boredom of endless lazy summer days,
% they'd sing 50s pop standards as they walked.
%
% Unfortunately for the tuneful trio, they stumble into young Fat
% Tony's patch of wacky tobaccy.  Tony and his goons are about to put
% Homer and his friends into a world of hurt when a BB pellet shoots
% past Tony ricocheting off of a rock.  Everyone looks to see young
% Moe standing on a rock, holding a BB rifle.

Louie:	Uh-oh, he's got a Daisy!
Tony:	We'd better scram.  Eighteen more pumps -- that could 
	break the skin.  [they run away]
-- "The Blunder Years"

% "And that's how a troubled young Moe saved the day," says the
% present-day version, who came to the Simpson house when he noticed
% his bar was empty.  Moe offers to help Homer uncover his hidden
% memory.  He sips some tea and begins reminiscing.

Moe:	Okay, that night we camped out under the stars.
	[dissolve to the past.  They boys are sitting around a 
	campfire]
	Ah, look at all them stars.  Bunch of lazy lights -- don't 
	do nothing for nobody.
Carl:	Hey, you know what I'm looking forward to?  The future.  
	Have you heard about this internet thing?
Lenny:	Internet?
Carl:	Yeah, it's the internetting they invented to line swim 
	trunks.  [holds up a pair of trunks caresses his face 
	lining] It provides a comforting snugness.
	[a whistle sounds in the distance]
Moe:	Hey, what was that?
	[pan to SNPP.  Flames rise from one of the cooling towers]
Lenny:	That's that nuclear plant that just opened.
Carl:	Yeah, that's your future -- busting atoms.  Can you 
	imagine us working there, the whole Carl Crew?
Lenny:	Hey, I thought we're called Lenny and the Jets.
Moe:	Eh, you're both wrong.  We're the Moe Szyslak Experience 
	featuring Homer.
Carl:	Uh, I like the sound of that.
Homer:	Friends forever?
All:	Friends forever!  [they join hands above the fire, which 
	gives them a painful burn]
Homer:	Ouch!
Lenny:	Ow, that hurts!
Carl:	Man, we're stupid.
Moe:	Hate you guys.
-- Friends for better or worse, "The Blunder Years"

% The next morning, the guys stand at the edge of the quarry.  It's a 
lo-o-o-ng drop to the water.

Moe:	[whistles] You guys really going to dive off of here?
Lenny:	Not me.  I'm shaking like a French soldier.
Moe:	Yeah, I think I just logged onto my internet.
-- That's one way to download, "The Blunder Years"

% Lenny figures only a moron would jump into the lake, which is
% Homer's cue to take a flying leap off the cliff.  Halfway down,
% Homer realizes something is missing:  The water at the bottom of the
% quarry.  He lands with a squish on the muddy quarry bottom and
% begins to scream.
%
% We return to the Simpsons' living room.

Moe:	And there's your what-chu-ma-call, repressed trauma.  I 
	mean, who likes getting muddy.  It's terrible.  Okay, 
	let's go to Moe's now.
Homer:	Wait a minute.  I remember falling in the mud, but I don't 
	think that's why I've been screaming.
Moe:	Fine.  Crap all over my theory.
Homer:	Something else happened in that quarry.  Something ... 
	else.
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Homer's thoughts drift back to the past, and so do we.  The young
% Homer looks up from the muddy quarry floor, and wonders what
% happened to the water.  He looks up a big pipe, and discovers that
% something's plugged it up.  Grabbing a stick, he pokes at the
% obstruction.  From the top of the cliff, Moe yells that the gang is
% going to Sears "to feel the bras," and leaves with Lenny and Carl. 
% Homer pays them no mind.  He dislodges whatever the obstruction is,
% releasing a torrent of water that knocks him off his feet.  He sits
% up.  The object is on his lap.  Homer lifts it up to see that it's
% ... a decomposing corpse!  Aieee!  Homer begins screaming, just as
% he did in the restaurant.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  12:54]
%
% We return to the Simpsons' living room, present day.

Marge:	You found a corpse when you were twelve?  No wonder you've 
	been so traumatized.  [hugs Homer]
Homer:	It's responsible for everything wrong in my life.  My 
	occasional overeating, my fear of corpses!  [cries]
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Uncovering Homer's memory answers one question, but asks another.

Moe:	What I want to know is, what the heck was that body doing 
	there?
Marge:	Maybe there's murder afoot.
Lisa:	Murder most foul?
Marge:	Maybe.
Lisa:	You know, if Dad never told anyone, that body must still 
	be out there.
Bart:	This sounds like a case that only the Simpson family can 
	solve!
Moe:	Oh ... okay.  Uh, we'll just be going, then.  [Moe, Lenny, 
	and Carl head for the door]
Homer:	Hey, you guys can come with us.
Moe:	No, no, no, you said "Simpson family."  I mean, you know, 
	it sounded exciting, but, uh, you know, we don't wanna 
	intrude.
Marge:	Thanks for understanding.
Moe:	Oh.  [pause] Oh, okay.  Well, I ... I'll see ya.  [leaves, 
	but forlornly looks through the living-room window.  The 
	family waves goodbye.  Moe gives up and walks away from 
	the house]
Homer:	[cheery] Bye, Moe!
-- He knows when he's not wanted, "The Blunder Years"

% That night, the family returns to the scene of the crime.

Homer:	[chuckles] Yup, the old quarry is just a stone's throw 
	away.
Lisa:	Stop saying that, Dad.
Homer:	Never!
-- Being repetitive is his job, "The Blunder Years"

% As the car stops at an intersection, Lisa spots Mesmerino picking up
% his mail.  The hip hypnotist does his Amazing Karnak impression for
% no one in particular.
%
% Finally, the Simpsons arrive at the old quarry.

Homer:	[shines a flashlight onto the water]  This is it.  This is 
	the old quarry.
Marge:	Maybe we should come back in the daytime.
Homer:	Someone's yellow belly is showing.
	[pan over to Bart, whose T-shirt has ridden up, exposing 
	his abdomen]
Bart:	Oh, sorry.  [pulls his shirt down]
-- "The Blunder Years"

% There's a rustling in the bushes, which turns out to be Chief
% Wiggum.  He saw the family's car at the quarry gate, and was hoping
% for the opportunity to rescue lost hikers and look heroic.  When
% Lisa tells him the family is investigating a possible murder, Wiggum
% asks to join in.  "I'm kind of a crime buff," he explains.
%
% At the edge of the swimming hole, Wiggum tries using a grappling
% hook to fish the body out of the water.  All he snags is an old
% decrepit shopping cart, the sight of which distresses Homer.  With
% all the water in the quarry, it looks like the Simpsons will never
% find the body.  Then, an idea comes to Marge.  She rushes home,
% returns with eight rolls of Burly paper towels, and throws them into
% the water.  The towels do their job, absorbing all the water in the
% lake (and impressing Chief Wiggum in the bargain).

Lisa:	Hey, what's that over there?
	[everyone runs over to a skeleton]
Wiggum:	Aw, don't get excited.  It's just a skull-shaped rock and 
	a bunch of white sticks.
Bart:	It's the body!
Homer:	And someone has eaten the flesh.  [looks accusingly at 
	Lisa, then Marge, then Lisa again]
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Now we're getting closer to solving this mystery.  The Simpsons and
% Chief Wiggum walk inside the pipe, which is large enough to permit
% everyone (even big-haired Marge) to stand upright.  Aside from that,
% it's a pretty uninviting place to be.  A trickle of water flows
% around everyone's ankles, and live rats scurry around.  At least,
% *some* of them are alive.

	[the body of a dead rat floats by]
Homer:	Now do you believe dead rats float, Lisa?
Lisa:	[fearful] Yes!
-- You learn something new every day, "The Blunder Years"

% The gang reaches the other end of the pipe.  There's a hatch
% overhead, and the murderer could be on the other side.  Wiggum cocks
% his pistol, and Homer slowly opens the hatch.  Wiggum peeks through,
% and sees a shadowy figure holding a knife.  The chief takes a shot
% which ricochets off a light switch.  The lights come up, revealing
% that the figure is Monty Burns, holding a letter opener.  He's
% understandably started by his visitors.

Burns:	What are you doing in my corpse hatch?
Wiggum:	Montgomery Burns, you're under arrest for murder.
Burns:	Uh, did I say "corpse hatch"?  I meant, "innocence tube."
-- A corpse hatch by any other name, "The Blunder Years"

% Bart isn't falling for Burns's innocent-guy act.  He produces the
% skill and asks if Burns can explain it.  Burns reacts with a mixture
% of annoyance and relief that his secret is finally out.

Wiggum:	All right, quit stalling, Burns.  Who'd ya ice?
Burns:	I'm afraid that skull belongs to my dear friend, Waylon 
	Smithers ... Senior.
Lisa:	[gasps] Mr. Smithers's father!
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Burns insists that he did not murder the elder Smithers, and has
% film to prove it.  As he sets up the projector, Homer calls the
% couch.  Everyone settles in to view the evidence.
%
% The old film shows a control room at the power plant, more than
% thirty years ago.  A warning klaxon sounds.  Mr. Burns, who still
% had hair (or at least a wig), stares at the console with concern.

Burns:		Why are these numbers so high?  Why is that red 
		light flashing?  What's that alarming sound?  
		Smithers, get in here!  Smithers!
		[Smithers, Sr. runs in, carrying a baby boy]
Senior:		Sorry, Monty.  I was feeding Waylon, Jr.
Burns:		Will you put that baby down!  There's something 
		wrong with the reactor core.
		[they look through a window in the reactor chamber 
		door.  Green bolts of electricity zigzag through the 
		chamber.  Smithers hands the baby to Burns]
Senior:		I'd better go in and have a look.  [opens the door]
Burns:		No, Waylon Senior.  I could be filled with atoms and 
		stinging with other nuclear bric-a-brac.
Senior:		If this reactor blows, this whole town is doomed -- 
		including my son.
		[goes in the chamber and closes the door]
Burns:		So, you're a baby, huh?  How's that working out for 
		you?
		[an "all-clear" chime sounds]
		He did it!  [holds Waylon Junior up to the chamber 
		window] Look at your heroic daddy in there, making 
		funny faces, falling to the floor, shedding his 
		hair, lying perfectly still ... [lowers Junior so he 
		can't see what's going on] oh, dear.
Smithers:	[grabs Burns's nose] Sir!
-- "The Blunder Years"

% The film ends there.

Burns:		Smithers, Sr. gave his life to save the plant, and 
		since cover-ups were all the rage back then, I 
		shoved his heroic corpse down the sewer pipe.  I 
		never told Smithers the truth about his father.
Smithers:	Until, tonight sir.
Burns:		[gasps] Smithers, Junior!
Bart:		Hah, busted!
Homer:		[eating popcorn] Now the movie's turned into a play!  
		Still good, though.
Burns:		I'm sorry I lied to you, Waylon, but I wanted to 
		spare you the details of your father's gruesome 
		death.
Smithers:	Well, I'm glad to know he died a hero, instead of 
		that other way.
Burns:		[to Marge] Heh, I told him his father was killed in 
		the Amazon by a tribe of savage women.  [to 
		Smithers] I hope it didn't affect you in any way.
Smithers:	We'll never know, sir.
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Another mystery solved, the Simpson family relaxes at home.

Homer:	[putting the skull in a box labeled, "Memories"] Well, 
	Marge, we solved the case of the haunted quarry.
Marge:	Homer, shouldn't we give that skull to Mr. Smithers?
Homer:	Why?  He'd just bury it.
-- "The Blunder Years"

% Suddenly, Moe runs into the room, holding an envelope.

Moe:	Hey!  Hey!  I found a clue that's going to bust your 
	mystery wide open!
Marge:	Sorry, we already solved it.
Moe:	Oh.  Well, um, you want to take a look at it anyways?  Eh, 
	just for ha-has?
Homer:	Seems kind of pointless now.
Moe:	Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just that I, I, went 
	through a lot of trouble, you know, making the envelope 
	and everything.
Marge:	[sympathetic] Let's see what you have, Moe.
Moe:	[clears throat] Okay.  [sits on the couch and takes a 
	bandage out of the envelope] Now this first thing is just 
	going to look like a used Band-Aid and, uh, and it is, but 
	the rest of the stuff don't make no sense without it so, 
	uh, you know, bear with me.
Marge:	Wow, Moe, you've been doing a lot of sleuthing.
Moe:	Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  I sleuthed my ass off on this one.  
	Uh, okay, [holds up a metal "6"] this is a number six from 
	somebody's address, or [inverts it] is it a nine?  You 
	don't know.
	[the scene fades to black.  Moe continues talking as the 
	closing	theme plays]
	Uh, this is gravel.  Uh, okay?  *Gravel.*  This is, uh, 
	that's more gravel.  Okay.  Oh -- this is a shell that, to 
	me -- this is just me talking -- it looks like a helmet 
	for a mouse.  Now, that sounds crazy, right?

	[the following dialogue wasn't heard in the United States 
	broadcast, as Fox USA elected cut the audio here to 
	promote upcoming episodes of the show.  It aired as the 
	writers intended in Canada, however]

	But, if you ask the mice about it, they don't say nothing.  
	I mean, they run the other way.  At first, I was just 
	fishing with the helmet thing, but then from the mouse's 
	reaction I got, uh, I got a little more concerned.
Homer:	Did you really make that envelope?  'Cause it says 
	"Hammermill" over here.
Moe:	Um ... no.
