Wiggum:   Hey, it's Alec Baldwin's Medic Alert bracelet!
Homer:    That's right, Mr. Tough Guy can't handle a little penicillin!
          Oh, and look at this!  We can't even pay our bills, and
          they're drinking [mockingly] "Royal Crown Cola".
Carl:     Hey, hey, go easy on the celebrities, eh?
Krusty:   Yeah, what gives you the right?
Barney:   We love celebrities!
Homer:    Oh yeah?  What have they ever done for you?  When was the
          last time Barbara Streisand cleaned out your garage?  And
          when it's time to do the dishes, where's Ray Bolger?  I'll
          tell ya!  Ray Bolger is looking out for Ray Bolger!

% Inside Kim and Alec's, the couple packs up their things.  Kim finds a
% picture of herself, Alec, and Homer dressed in clothes from the Old
% West.

Kim:      Oh, look.  Wasn't that a fun weekend?
Alec:     Yeah.  Homer was a pretty good guy.  And we just tossed him
          out like a Golden Globe award.  I've got to admit, I miss the
          way he used to tuck us in and kiss us on the forehead.
Kim:      Forehead?
Alec:     Aw, maybe I should've made his movie.
Kim:      Yeah, it wasn't that bad.  I mean the script might even work
          if you got rid of the talking pie.
Alec:     What, are you crazy?  It's a buddy picture.  Without the pie,
          it would just be me on screen for two hours.
Kim:      Oh, yeah, and you'd hate that.
Ron:      No, no, no, you can't lose the pie!  The pie's your heart.
Kim:      Okay, okay, keep the damn pie.  The point is, we weren't fair
          to Homer.  He screwed up, but he deserves another chance.
Alec:     Yeah, everyone makes mistakes.  I mean, we'd want another
          chance if one of us ever made a bad film, right?
          [the three of them sit in conspicuous silence]
-- Uh, right, "When You Dish Upon a Star"

% Outside the summer home, Kim, Alec, and Ron get into their car.  Kim,
% in the driver's seat, pushes the remote control for the gate.  It
% opens.

I'm really looking forward to seeing Homer again.  He always has the
most interesting odors.
-- Kim Basinger, "When You Dish Upon a Star"

% Homer, standing in the middle of the street outside, surrounded by a
% few of the people gathered outside, is holding one of Kim's bras over
% his shirt and mocking her.  The celebrities stare in disbelief.  When
% Homer notices the celebrities staring down at him, he hurriedly
% thanks everyone for supporting the museum of Hollywood jerks, runs
% inside the RV and drives away.

Kim:      Let's get him.
Alec:     And this time ... it's personal.  [Alec and Ron look at him]
          What?  It *is* personal.  He's got our underpants!
-- "When You Dish Upon a Star"

% While driving the secluded road, Homer checks his mirror and sees the
% stars' vehicle behind him.

Homer:    I'll never outrun them in a museum!
Alec:     [driving alongside him] Pull over, you maniac!
Homer:    No!
Kim:      Just jump over there, Alec, it's not that far!
Ron:      Yeah, you're a big-screen tough guy.
Alec:     Gee, I'd love to, but I'm not really wearing the right shoes.
Ron:      [makes "chicken" noises]
Alec:     Fine!
-- "When You Dish Upon a Star"

% Alec makes the jump, them climbs onto the roof of the RV; Homer
% screams and rolls up his window.
%
% Alec congratulates himself for making the jump, until a passing
% branch collides with his head, knocking him backwards.  Just before he
% falls off the roof, however, his watch is snagged on a bar on the roof
% of the trailer.  He dangles behind.

Kim:      Oh, for the love of ... hold on!  [to Ron]  Can you drive?
Ron:      Not well.  But I'll give it a shot.
-- "When You Dish Upon a Star"

% Kim stands up and prepares to jump over to Homer's vehicle.  Leaping,
% she lands on the roof, but falls off when Homer panics and begins to
% swerve.  Luckily, she manages to grab the driver's side rear-view
% mirror, to which she hangs on for dear life.  Meanwhile, Alec's
% watchband snaps, sending him off the back; he grabs onto the spare
% tire and dangles just barely above the road.  "I guess it's up to me,"
% Ron says, and prepares to jump.  Readying himself, he leaps from the
% side and immediately plunges to the road.  Alec and Kim, still hanging
% on, look back and shout his name.
%
% Kim knocks on the window and tells Homer he killed Ron Howard.  This
% finally convinces him to stop.
%
% Much later, Homer and the stars sit in court; Ron has his head
% bandaged and has his arm in a sling, but is otherwise okay.

Judge:    Mr. Simpson, do you have anything to say for yourself?
Homer:    Yes, I do.  I believe that famous people have a debt to
          everyone.  If celebrities didn't want people pawing through
          their garbage and saying they're gay, they shouldn't have
          tried to express themselves creatively.
-- "When You Dish Upon a Star"

% Alec, Marge, and Lisa put their hands in their faces at this, while
% Ron shakes his head and Kim holds her hands out and looks skyward.

Homer:    In closing, you people must realize that the public owns you
          for life!  And when you're dead, you'll all be in
          commercials, dancing with vacuum cleaners.  Thank you, your
          honor.
Judge:    Mr. Simpson, you are forbidden to come within 500 miles of
          any celebrity, living or dead.  [bangs gavel]
          [Kim, Alec, and Ron shout "woo-hoo", and throw their hands
          up]
Homer:    Well, I'll always have my crank calls.  [dials a cell phone]
          Hello, old lady from Titanic?  You stink!  [giggles]
-- "When You Dish Upon a Star"

% One month later, at the 20th Century Fox Film Studios, Ron Howard
% pitches a movie to a film executive, who sits at his desk.

Ron:           [emotionally] And it grows, to a powerful, emotional
               climax when the father has to choose which one of his
               children will live ... and which one ... will die.
Executive:     Pass.
               [Ron lets out a sigh]
               What else you got?
Ron:           Well, well, there is this one thing.  It's about a
               killer robot driving instructor that travels back in
               time for some reason.
Executive:     I'm listening.
Ron:           Okay, okay, well, you see ... this robot, he's got a
               heartbreaking decision to make about whether his best
               friend lives ... or dies.
Executive:     Eh.
Ron:           His best friend's a talking pie!
Executive:     Sold!  Howard, you've done it again!
               [he hands Ron two large bags of money; Ron holds them up
               and smiles, as the closing line from the "Happy Days"
               theme plays]
-- "The Terminizor," coming soon to a theater near you, "When You Dish
   Upon a Star"

% Normal closing credits, except instead of the Gracie shush, we hear,
