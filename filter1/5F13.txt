 Marge: Is that normal?
Wiggum: No, he's just playing 'wiggle Puppy'!  That's a dog he made

 Bart: [to Ralph] Someone will be right with you. [slams door] Mom,
       school has changed a lot since you were a kid.  Popularity is
       very important now.
Marge: But--
 Bart: Don't talk. Just listen. The social order of elementary school is
       densely layered.  The coolest kids are at the top...
Marge: Oh, you mean like the 'A' students?
 Bart: [pauses] I don't wanna play with Ralph.
Marge: He's just a misunderstood little boy who needs a friend!  And, if
       he hangs around with you, well, everyone will think he's cool!
 Bart: [flattered] Well, I don't know about that... it might help him a

% Bart pushes Ralph into some nearby bushes as the bullies drive past.

-- Ralph coming out a thorn bush, "This Little Wiggy"

% Meanwhile, Ralph is giving Bart a tour of his back garden.

Ralph: This is my swing set.  This is my sandbox. I'm not allowed to

 Bart: [sarcastically] Right, a leprechaun.
Ralph: He told me to burn things.
 Bart: [unsure] Uh huh...
-- I'm the leprochaaaaauuun! "This Little Wiggy"

% Later, in Ralph's bedroom, Bart is pondering on things to do.

Ralph: Wanna play stuffed animal parade?
 Bart: Maybe later.  Come on, Ralph, your dad's a cop!  There must be
       some cool stuff around here, bullets, dead body photos, what have you.
Ralph: He keeps that stuff in his closet.  But he says I'm not allowed in

 Bart: Did he say I'm not allowed in there?
Ralph: Yes.
 Bart: [pause] Well, I'm goin' in anyway!

% Chief Wiggum does a break fall towards the cupboard, and injures his
% back. Bart and Ralph emerge from the closet.

What is your fascination with my forbidden closet of mystery?
-- It's just a kid-thing, Chief Wiggum, "This Little Wiggy"

Ralphie, you got a friend?  Hey... that's fantastic! Here, here, have
some riot gear; it's on the house! [Ralph and Bart attack each other
with the riot gear, with helmets as protection]  Aaah, that takes me
back to the Sixties.
-- Chief Wiggum, "This Little Wiggy"

% Wiggum leaves the room and hangs a weird key on his bed post.

 Bart: What's that weird key for?

% Back at the Simpson house, Homer and Marge are trying to pick an

We now return to 'The Return of the Pink Panther Returns' starring Ken Wahl

-- I think I saw that one.. or the sequel, "This Little Wiggy"

% Bart tries to get the key with the handle of a broom. It hits Chief a few
% times, but then Bart gets it. Bart throws in a few extra shots at Chief.

% Bart and Ralph, now possessing the Springfield Master Key, stand outside
% a J.R.R. Toykins, and unlock the doors.

 Bart: The world is our toy store.
Ralph: Toy store, toy store, toy store!  Whee!
 Bart: I want to be eight again.
-- At least you'll never get any older than ten, "This Little Wiggy"

% Bart and Ralph build a giant lego brick with small lego bricks, practice

Ralph: I can't believe we ate a whole wedding cake! 
 Bart: And an entire pan of funeral fudge! 
-- "This Little Wiggy"

% Suddenly, Bart stops. Jimbo, Dolph, Kearney and Nelson are playing Hacky
% Sack with a frog. They notice Bart and Ralph. They warm up with the
% usual insults, and learn from Ralph that they're on a playdate.

  Bart: I'll take it from here, Ralph. [to the bullies] Um, we're hangin'.
        Chillin'.  A little bit of hillin'. 
Nelson: I don't get you, Simpson.  Sometimes you seem kinda righteous, but
        then we see you fraternizing with lameoids. 
 Jimbo: Which makes you a lamewad! 
  Bart: Oh yeah? Would a lamewad have the police master key? 
-- No but a dorkzilla would, "This Little Wiggy"

% The four are impressed. They choose things to do with it, but Bart has
% the best idea.

% Bart, Ralph and the bullies are outside Morningwood Penitentiary. Bart
% really does have some strange ideas.

  Bart: There she is!  The big house, the stony lonesome, the thug jug, the
        mobster trap, Penn State, the oral crook--
Nelson: Shut up, let's just open the gate. 
-- "This Little Wiggy"

% Ralph is scared about going in.

It's just an abandoned prison. All the murderers are long dead, and I'm
sure their ghosts are probably in hell.
-- "This Little Wiggy"

% Jimbo orders Bart to ditch Ralph. Bart does so, bringing Ralph to tears.

Ha ha! Wait, I missed that!  Get him to say it again!
-- Jimbo Jones with a camcorder, after Ralph pours some emotions out,

% Bart decides he can't bail out on a friend, even if it is Ralph. The

  Bart: Hey, come on!  I thought we were friends.
Nelson: Yeah, well, I hope the irony's not lost on you, Simpson.
        [punches Bart in the stomach, sending him into a mud puddle, and
        throws the Springfield master key through a now-shattered window]

 Dolph: This sucks.  Let's do something else. 
Nelson: [excited] I know, let's go pick some huckleberries!
        [the gang agrees, enthusiastically]
-- What the hell is this? "This Little Wiggy" 

% The gang leaves. Ralph runs through the gate of the Penitentiary, after
% the key Bart follows.

Wow, look at all these toilets!  They're just inches your bed! Talk about
luxury..
-- Bart in Morningwood Penitentiary, "This Little Wiggy"

There's the key! [a rat takes it] Aagh!  The pointy kitty took it!
-- Ralph, "This Little Wiggy"

% They follow the rat. It goes into a room labeled "Danger". They go
% inside. It turns out to be the electric chair room.

 Bart: Woah, mama, the electric chair! [sniffs] Smell that, Ralph? That's
       the smell of justice.
Ralph: Smells like hot dogs.

 Bart: Oh, see, here's the problem, Ralph.  You have several threes.
Ralph: Go fish!
-- Hmmm.. wanna go fishing? "This Little Wiggy"

% Bart flicks on the TV. Well whaddya know -- it's the news at Morningwood
% Penitentiary. Talk about coincidence! And Mayor Quimby's about to
% demonstrate the electric chair -- since it's <deactivated> -- how about
% that?

 Ralph: Hey, there's our play chair!
Quimby: To demonstrate what you're in for, I will now strap myself into
        this electric chair, which was deactivated over thirty years ago,
        and, I  can only assume, still is.
  Bart: Uh oh, we didn't reset the safety switch.
 Ralph: He's going to smell like hot dogs!
-- Dear God NO! "This Little Wiggy"

% Bart runs over to the telephone and dials O. He gets Morningwood
% Penitentiary, but the line is busy.

Now, Martha, we've been over this and over this!  We're too old to start

a new twine ball?
-- The Morningwood Penitentiary security guard, on the phone with his wife,
"This Little Wiggy"

% Bart and Ralph need a way of warning Mayor Quimby -- and fast!

 Bart: Come on, a man's life is at stake. We need to get a message to the
       prison. [shaking Ralph] Think! THINK!
Ralph: Lisa's a good thinker.
 Bart: That's it!  Ralph, you're a genius!
-- "This Little Wiggy" 

% Back at the press conference, Mayor Quimby reminds his staff not to come
% to his assistance, no matter how realistic his performance may be. In
% Bart's room, Lisa scribbles a warning note and attaches it to Bart's
% rocket. They launch it, but it misses the Penitentiary completely.
% Instead, it pings from a cooling tower at the SNPP, and soars through
% Mr. Burns' office window, dropping into his jacket pocket.

   Burns: Smithers! There's a rocket in my pocket!
Smithers: You don't have to tell me, sir.
-- "This Little Wiggy"

% The electric chair is switched on, as we see. However, since Quimby
% stressed not to come to his aid -- no matter how realistic his
% performance is -- his crew just watch.  Meanwhile, Burnsie reads the
% note.

'Electric chair is on', eh?  Then the old prison has been getting free
electricity for thirty years!  I'll put a stop to that!
-- Mr. Burns, "This Little Wiggy"

% He turns off the electricity by the touch of a button. The electrocuting
% stops and Quimby is half dead.  OFF cheer for Ralph.

 Bart: Way to go, Ralph!
 Lisa: Ralph? But the rocket was my idea!
 Bart: But asking you was Ralph's idea!
Homer: You're the man, Ralph!
-- Justice -- does it smell like hotdogs now? "This Little Wiggy"

% OFF cheer on Ralph, Lisa being the last to join. A small leprechaun appears
