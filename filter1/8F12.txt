% We begin with a computer-generated sequence, depicting two football
% players approaching each other.  The red-uniformed player (#86) sticks
% out his arm, decapitating the blue-uniformed player (#12), whose head
% flies off (with a shocked expression), sailing through logo, ``Inside
% Football Today.''  Brent Gunsilman welcomes the home audience to ``six
% hours of exciting football action.''  Homer, surrounded by his favorite
% salt- and cholesterol-laden treats, announces ``Bye-bye belt!'' and lets
% it all hang out.  He then digs in ferociously.  Marge sees him and warns
% him that those foods aren't good for his heart.  Homer scoffs, ``My
% heart is just fine.''  We take an inside look at Homer's chest
% cavity, where an aorta blows up like a balloon (presumably due to a
% clogged artery), but the danger is averted when the clog clears, and
% the blood continues on its way.  (``A little beer will put out <that>
% fire,'' says Homer.)

And now, with his picks for today's games, the man who's right 52% of
the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo!

% But Homer isn't paying any attention.  (``Lousy stupid Denver...'')

Lisa:  No. ... Well, we used to have burping contests, but I outgrew it.
-- ``Lisa the Greek''

Well, if you want to get closer to him, then maybe <you> should bridge the

you about when you're older.
-- Marge's advice to Lisa, ``Lisa the Greek''

% Bart slips a dish into the bathwater and receives a brief scolding.

% In the third quarter, New England is winning, 35 to 7.  Lisa suggests
% that she watch the game with Homer, and he reluctantly agrees.  ``Just
% don't say anything and sit down over there.''  Lisa plops on the couch,
% and Homer tells her to keep moving over until she's at the far end of
% the sofa.  Lisa sighs.  Homer scolds, ``Lisa, please, I can't hear the
% announcer.''  ``He said Denver just fumbled.''  ``D'oh!''
%
% In the yard, Bart uses a magnifying glass to melt a plastic soldier toy.
% (``See you in hell, soldier boy!'')  Marge suggests that, since Homer and
% Lisa are inside watching the game, it ``might be fun'' for Bart to go
% shopping for clothes with her.  Bart maintains that he doesn't need new
% clothes, though his point is undermined by the holes in the shirt and pants
% he's currently wearing.
%
% Back to `Inside Football Today', where New England has defeated Denver
% by a score of 55 to 10.

Smooth Jimmy Apollo:  [explaining his poor prediction]

% Marge drags Bart to `Wee Monsieur'', a clothing store for young men.

Mom, I'm tired.  I want to go home.  Can't I just lie down for a minute?
-- Bart whines about being forced to shop for clothes, ``Lisa the Greek''

% There, she loads up Bart with brightly-patterned clothes.

Bart:  You know why these clothes are on sale, Mom?
       Because the people who wear them get beaten up.
Marge: Well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend.
