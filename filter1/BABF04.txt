% Scratchy, Springfield's favorite animated feline, is no more.  Other

% coffin to pay their last respects.  Itchy takes the demise of his 
% nemesis especially hard, paging through a scrapbook of all the good 
% (good from Itchy's point of view, at any rate) times the two had 
% shared.

% Itchy sheds a tear, but then notices a newspaper headline.  
% Scientists have successfully cloned a sheep.  Suddenly, Itchy gets 
% an idea.  If a sheep can be cloned from a DNA sample, why not a cat?  
% Getting some of Scratchy's blood from a cleaver, Itchy builds a 
% cloning machine.  With the blood sample, the machine is soon 
% cranking out new Scratchies.  Itchy dispatches several of them in a

% machine.  Inspiration strikes again, and Itchy builds a killing

% Everyone in the family is enjoying the cartoon, except for Marge.

Marge:	[to herself] Okay, here goes ... [walks quietly toward the 
	door, carrying a large box]
	[the rest of the family continues to look at the 
	television]
Bart:	Cloning is a troubling issue.
Homer:	I like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.
Lisa:	[not looking away from the TV] What's in the box, Mom?
Marge:	This box?  Oh, nothing.
Bart:	Are you sure?  You sound nervous.
Marge:	Well, anyone would be nervous with all the economic 
	turmoil you read about in the -- [hurriedly opens the 
	door]
Homer:	Get her!  She's doing something!
-- "Little Big Mom"

% Marge rushes outside with the box and wedges the front door closed
% from the outside.  The family looks out the window and is horrified
% to see a Goodwill truck.  Marge is going to give their precious,
% precious attic junk away!
%
% With the exits sealed, Homer goes to plan B -- crawling through the
% doggie door.  Unfortunately, he's too big to fit, so the kids help
% force him through.  Finally, the wood framing gives way, and Homer
% makes it through, wearing the doggie door for a belt.
%
% The truck driver pulls away, but Homer catches up to the truck and
% retrieves the box.  He jumps out, and rolls back down the street,
% trying heroically to keep the box upright and off the pavement as he
% goes.
%
% Back home, the Simpsons gather around the hard-won box.

Homer:	That was scary.  We came this close to losing our spare 
	Christmas tree stand.  [to Marge] You monster!
Bart:	Look, there's the box for my Pitch Back.  If I still had 
	it, I could put it in here.
Marge:	[sighs] We'll never get rid of this useless junk.
Homer:	Useless?  This flash cube has two flashes left.
Marge:	You guys never use any of this stuff.  Look at these -- 
	[holds up a pair of skis] -- you bought them after the 
	Nagano Olympics, and never skied once.  If you would stop 
	being so impulsive, maybe --
Homer:	Hey, let's go skiing right now!
Bart +
 Lisa:	Yay!  Let's go!  Etc.!
Marge:	[resigned] Ooooh.
-- "Little Big Mom"

% So, off they go to Mt. Embolism.  The Simpsons stand in the chair
% lift area.  The lift manager instructs them to keep their eyes on
% the continuously-moving chairs.  Bart plays a little joke on his
% father by pointing off in the distance and shouting, "Look, Dad,
% it's the drummer from Bread!"  When Homer tries to spot him, the
% chair knocks him down.  A second chair swoops by and hooks Homer's
% ski.  He begins the journey up the mountain by hanging precariously
% by one foot from the chair.  A snow-throwing machine covers him in
% fine powder, while an exhaust blast from a snow truck thaws him off.
%
% Marge isn't having a much easier time of it.  Fearful of the height,
% she's relieved to find that the lift is approaching the top of the
% mountain.  Alas, she was really approaching a false peak -- the lift
% continues up the mountain to the *real* top somewhere above the
% cloud line.  Bart "helpfully" tries to rock the chair to soothe
% Marge.

% At the top of the mountain ...

Lisa:	[getting off the chair] See, Mom?  You conquered your

	mountain]
Marge:	I'm sorry!
-- Perhaps next time, "Little Big Mom"

% Standing in front of a sign listing the names of ski trails, Homer
% looks for one posing a suitable challenge.

Homer:		Hmmm, "The Widowmaker?"  Oh, that one's for the 
		ladies.  "Spinebuster?"  Boring!  Ooh, 
		"Colostomizer."
		[a man in downhill ski outfit and a full-face helmet 
		skis up to Homer, startling him]
		Don't hurt me!  Here's my wallet!
		[the man lifts his helmet visor -- it's Ned 
		Flanders]
Ned:		Hi-diddily-ho, schuss-in-boots.
Homer:		[gasps] Flanders!?  That's suit's a little 
		revealing, isn't it?
Ned:		Well, it allows for maximum mobility.  Feels like 
		I'm wearing nothing at all.  [wiggles butt at Homer]
Homer:		[covering face with his hands] Quit it!  Must wash 
		eyes!
		[begins to drift down the slope, backward]
		Uh-oh.
		[turns around and picks up speed]
		Okay, don't panic.  Remember what the instructor 
		said.
		[a thought bubble forms, with the instructor inside 
		it]
Instructor:	If you get in trouble, all you need to do is --
		[the image of Flanders pushes aside the instructor]
Ned:		Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all ... nothing at 
		all ... nothing at all.
Homer:		Oh, stupid sexy Flanders.
-- "Little Big Mom"

% Homer's legs splay further apart, so he's skiing down the mountain 
% spread-eagled.  He thinks this is the worst pain ever.  That is,
% until he reaches the moguls.  The little mounds bash him repeatedly
% in the family jewels.  He skis off the path and down the ski jump,
% where he falls off the side and face first into the snow.  At the
% bottom, Homer saves face by nonchalantly hopping aboard the ski
% lift.

% Elsewhere on the mountain, Lisa struggles with cross-country skiing.

Lisa:	[panting for breath] So hard ... but so rewarding.  
	Downhill skiers missing fun -- oh, who am I kidding?
	[Lisa sees a family of deer frolicking in the snow]
	Wow, what a perfect scene!  This was so worth it.
	[the deer look at Lisa] Don't worry, little friends.  I 
	won't hurt you.  [the deer growl menacingly]
	Eep.  [the deer give chase]
	Help!  [runs away; trips and falls down.  As the deer come 
	in for the kill, a park ranger shows up on a snowmobile]
Ranger:	Leave those deer alone!
Lisa:	But, they were trying to eat me!
Ranger:	Heh!  Those deer?  [the deer have returned to their 
	peaceable foraging]
Lisa:	But they --
Ranger:	Come on, I'll drop you off at the lodge.
	[Lisa climbs aboard the snowmobile, and the two drive off.  
	Lisa looks back at the deer, and the growl at her]

% Even though Marge is ensconced in the ski lodge, she faces hazards

	[to Marge] Is this seat taken?
Marge:	Uh, I think that's an armrest.
Stu:	[sitting down] So, do you party?
Marge:	You mean like a hats and noisemakers kind of party?
Stu:	Sure, baby, whatever your trip is.  Disco Stu wants you to

% Homer joins Marge and the kids.

Lisa:	[to Marge] Have you been here all day?
Homer:	You missed all the fun.
Marge:	Skiing fanny-first into a crevasse isn't my idea of fun.  
	The only risk I'm taking is running out of marshmallows.  
	[laughs.  A heavy clock falls from the wall onto her leg]
	Ow!
Homer:	Somebody get a doctor!
-- At least she has plenty of marshmallows, "Little Big Mom"

% Two men rush up and bemoan yet another clock accident.  They mount
% the clock precariously back on the wall, and sidle off.

% Soon, Marge is loaded aboard an ambulance.  The sign on the front

Hibbert:	Well, as you can see, you have a compound fracture.

		bone could zoom right to her brain.  [chuckles]
Marge:		I can't be in the hospital.  Tomorrow's laundry day.  
		And I've got to de-meat Lisa's bologna.
Homer:		We'll be fine, honey.  The main thing is for you to 
		get better.
Bart:		And don't worry, all the laundry and dirty dishes 
		will be there when you get back.
Lisa:		No, they won't.  We'll all pitch in on the 
		housework.  Right, guys?  Guys?
		[the guys aren't listening; they're busy squirting 
		each other with a blue liquid from IV bottles]
Marge:		Sweetie, it's nice that you want to take charge 
		around the house, but don't be a hero.  Just make 
		sure your father eats all his meals over a tarp -- 
		but not the good tarp.  I want you to get married on 
		that some day.
Lisa:		Oh, Mom, I've seen what you do around the house, and 
		I can handle it.  Maybe I can even make things more 
		efficient.
Marge:		Oh, really?  Well, knock yourself out.  Just don't 
		expect any miracles from those two.

-- So it wasn't such a waste after all, "Little Big Mom"

% The next day, Homer shows up for breakfast in his underwear. 
% Apparently, one of Marge's little daily tasks is to dress her

Lisa:	Okay, now we're going to draw jobs from the chore hat.

	Feed fish.
Bart:	I'll supervise.
Lisa:	You know, the reason for the hat --
Homer:	Oh, it's a great hat.  No one's questioning the hat.
Lisa:	Will you at least do the dishes?
Homer:	Lisa, I'll do the dishes when I pick it out of the chore 
	hat, and it's not a practice.  [takes another slip] See, 
	there it is.  But that was a practice.  The system works.

% Homer (or maybe Bart, who was supervising) devises a clever way to

Lisa:	Oh, those boys of mine.
-- Little sister knows best, "Little Big Mom"

% At the hospital, a nurse orders Marge to stop trying to clean the

% which turns up her morphine drip.  Mr. Sakamoto, the accupressurist, 
% shows up to massage Marge's foot.  He wants her to relax while he
% "does his thing."  She relaxes, in a big way.
%
% Lisa sets up the dining room for an elegant meal.  The effort seems
% lost on the rest of the family, though.  Homer growls when Lisa
% tries to take a plate back to re-melt the cheese.  Lisa makes a
% quick trip to the kitchen to fetch slivered almonds for the green
% beans.  When she returns just seconds later, she finds an empty
% dining room, and nothing but dirty dishes on the table.  The family
% has reconvened in the living room, in front of the TV.  Lisa tries

Homer:	It's the bread of astronauts.

	know Aerosmith made a cereal.
Lisa:	Dad, I gave you a list.
Homer:	Oh, yeah.  [reads list and laughs] You were way off.

% Lisa calls Marge at the hospital.  Things are going great for Marge,
