-- And whatever's left inbetween, "Homer's Phobia"

% The reindeer keep knocking Homer around when the attack is interrupted
% by the toy-keyboard sound of "Jingle Bells."  The reindeer back away
% as this thing nears closer to a beaten up Homer, deadpanning "Ho ho
% ho..." Yup, it's the mechanical Santa, Mr. "Annual Gift Man" in person.

Homer: Look, Bart!  It's Santa Claus!
        [robot fires two missiles, which makes reindeer back-up]
 Bart: Woah, it's Santa all right.  And he is kicking ass!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% All the reindeer run away.

Homer: It's a miracle!
 John: [holding the Santa remote] No, ultrasuede is a miracle. This is
       just good timing.
Marge: Oh, Homie, I'm so glad you're safe.  [hugs him]
       Hmm, you feel softer than before.
Homer: [in pain] I've been tenderized.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

  Bart: How'd you know that thing would work?
  John: Well the sound is just _brutal_, and I figured reindeer would
        naturally be afraid of their cruel master Santa Claus.  I mean,
        wouldn't you be?  Ha!
Barney: Is it okay to come out now, Mr. Gay Man?  Sir?
   Moe: I'll do anything you say!  *Anything*!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% All is well that ends well, as everyone heads home.  However, some
% wounds will take some time to heal...

Barney: Aw, Moe, we were saved by a sissy.
   Moe: Yeah, yeah, we'll never live it down.  Oh, boy, it looks like
        it's suicide again for me.
 Homer: Hey!  We owe this guy, and I don't want you calling him a sissy.
        This guy's a fruit, and a... no, wait, wait, wait: queer, queer
        queer!  That's what you like to be called, right?
  John: Well, that or John.
  Lisa: This is about as tolerant as Dad gets so you should be
        flattered.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

Well, Homer, I won your respect, and all I had to do was save your life.
Now, if every gay man could just do the same, you'd be set.
-- John sums up the situation, "Homer's Phobia"

% On the ride home, Homer delivers a long-awaited message to his son.

Homer: You know, Bart, maybe it's the concussion talking, but any way
       you choose to live your life is okay with me.
 Bart; Huh?
 Lisa: [whispering] He thinks you're gay.
 Bart: He thinks I'm gay?!
        ["Everybody Dance Now" plays on-screen]
-- So do some people on a.t.s., it seems, "Homer's Phobia"

% We cut closer and closer to Bart's mystified face in accordance with
% the song, which plays on as John's car drives off. The words
% "Dedicated to The Steelworkers of America Keep Reaching For That
% Rainbow" appear on screen as the song plays during the credits.
