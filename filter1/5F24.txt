% Bart and Homer walk in the door, carrying a bag.

Marge: We got the popcorn! Did you get "Waiting to Exhale"?
Homer: They put us on the "Waiting to Exhale" waiting list, but they said 
       "don't hold your breath".
-- "All Singing, All Dancing"

% Lisa asks if they got "Emma". When Homer says no, Marge enquires what 
% they did get.

Homer:        Something very close, exactly along those lines. A Clint 
              Eastwood, Lee Marvin shoot-em-up western!
Marge & Lisa: Hmmmm...
Bart:         So prepare yourself for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage 
              of Joshua Logan's "Paint Your Wagon"!
Homer:        With blood, I bet!
-- Homer and Bart's replacement for "Emma," "All Singing, All Dancing"

% Bart puts the video in the VCR. It starts with a man (man 1) on a horse 
% and wagon, riding into a typical Western movie-style deserted village. A 
% man dressed in a black suit (Clint Eastwood) is waiting for him.

Man 2:          Hey! That's a pretty sorry lookin' wagon you got there,
                mister.
Clint Eastwood: I reckon it could use a coat of paint.
Man 2:          Well, what are we waitin' for!
-- Intense! "All Singing, All Dancing"

% They proceed to sing about painting their wagon, which is repeated by a 
% group of townsfolk, much to the horror of Homer and Bart.

Homer: Agh! They're singing! They're singing, Marge! Why aren't they killing 
       each other?
Bart:  Yeah, their guns are right there.
Homer: Wait, wait, wait: here comes Lee Marvin. Thank God. He's always drunk 
       and violent.
-- "All Singing, All Dancing"

% Another man comes out, played by Lee Marvin.

Lee Marvin: What the <hell> is going on in my town?
Man 1:      We're just paintin' this wagon. Ya gotta problem with that?
Lee Marvin: As a matter of fact I do. You missed a spot.
Man 1:      Well, grab a brush and join in!
-- "All Singing, All Dancing"

% Marvin breaks into song on his own, saying he'll use oil based paint, 
% because the wood is pine (Ponderosa pine, sing the women).

Marge: Who knew that Lee Marvin could do such marvellous splits?
Lisa:  He's dreamy.
Homer: [ejects tape] Ooh, why did they have to ruin a perfectly serviceable 
       wagon story with all that fruity singing?
-- "All Singing, All Dancing"

% Although Marge thought it was "toe-tappin' fun", Homer thinks that singing 
% is the "lowest form of communication".

Marge: Homer, you sing all the time.
Homer: No I don't, I hate to rhyme.
Lisa:  You like musicals, (breaking into song) don't you dad?
Homer: [singing] No, I don't, I think they're bad,
       They're fake and phony and totally wrong
Bart:  [singing] Wake up dad, you're singing a song.

% Homer protests, but Marge says that their videos show otherwise: roll clip

%
% Homer walks out a door on the roof of Moe's Tavern, where Apu, Seymour, 
% and Barney wait for him.
%
% The four break into "Baby On Board," and all the passers-by stop to
% listen. No one pays any attention to "Human Fly", who stayed up all night 
% dyeing his underwear.  A newsie hocks a paper to a man by pretending it 
% contained an article about the Be Sharps.  George Harrison drives by in 
% his limo, rolls down the window, and glances up at the four of 
% them..."It's been done," he says, and drives off.  Even Wiggum and Lou 
% seem impressed at the display, until Wiggum tells Lou to get the tear gas.

% slowly wins the heart of all mobsters. End clip.
%
% Back in the present, Bart agrees with Marge that Homer's singing is a sin.

Bart:  [singing] Mom was right: your singing's a sin;
       It's as lame as a rawhide (?), as Lee Marvi-- (Homer chokes him)
Marge: [singing] Sure your dad's singing could make your hair curl,
       But you too, Bart, have sung and danced like a girl.
Bart:  Eeeep.

% The boys cheer as they walk out.  Milhouse forces a straw into the
% Squishy, commenting how thick it is.  He tries to drink some of it
% through the straw, but he sucks the straw into his throat and his
% glasses fly off.  Bart doesn't bother with the straw; he simply drinks
% straight out of the cup.  "Whoa!  That's good squishy," he smiles, but
% then his eyes start to go wonky and he groans.  His vision trebles, and
% three Milhouses ask him, "What's it like, Bart?"  Bart can only stutter
% incoherently, and Milhouse grabs the Squishy: "Gimme that!"  He takes a
% slurp, then groans himself, and his face twitches.

    Bart: OK, we're young, rich, and full of sugar.  What do we do?
Milhouse: [yelling] Let's go crazy, Broadway style!
           [singing together]
          Springfield, Springfield, it's a hell of a town:

Milhouse: Springfield, Springfield!

% skateboard park, where a man in a suit shows Bart a skateboard for his
% approval.  At the VIP video game room, Milhouse plays two games at once
% while a garcon brings him a drink.  The boys go to see "Cats" next, and
% Bart mischieviously starts a cat-fight by spitting some Squishy at one
% of the actors.  Then, they buy lots of packs of "Toothless Joe"-brand
% bubblegum-flavored chewing product and blow immense bubbles with it --
% so immense that when the bubbles burst, they are covered with pink
% stuff.  Homer happens by, and he sticks his finger in it and licks it
% off.  "Mmm, free goo."
%
% At the 24-hour rub-on tattoo parlor, Bart gets a cobweb and bat on his
% right arm and a snake on his left arm, while Milhouse has a woman on his
% right arm, a globe on his left arm, and a fiery skull on his torso.  As
