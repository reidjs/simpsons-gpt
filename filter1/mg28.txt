% Homer leads the family through the zoo.   Homer brandishes a bag of
% peanuts.  Marge carrues a red purse.  Lisa holds a soda.  Bart wears
% a red hat with the word `Zoo' on it.  Maggie falls.

H: This way to the monkey house, everybody.
B: Can I have a peanut, Dad?
H: Shut up and pay attention.
B: All I asked for was a measly peanut.
M: Don't sass your father, Bart.
L: Yeah, Bart.

% They pass by a sign that reads, ``Do not feed or tease feed the monkeys''.

H: Now, over here, we have the typical monkey family.
   Just look at their stupid antics.

% The monkeys look astonishingly like the Simpsons.  Homer-monkey wallops
% Bart-monkey totally without provocation.  The family laugh, except for
% Bart.  Bart approaches the cage.

B: Hey, man, I know just how you feel.

% Bart-monkey hands Bart a peanut.

% A purple arm reaches out from the cage.

H: Whooooooooo!!!!

% Homer yanks the bag just out of reach.

H: Heh heh heh heh heh.
B: [bored] Dad, don't tease the monkeys.
H: Oh, I'm just funning with them.  Hey monkey... Want some peanuts?

% Homer shakes the bag.  A purple arm reaches out, Homer (with a ``Whoooo!''
% and a chuckle) yanks the bag out of reach.

L: They don't like it, Dad.
M: She's right, Homer.
H: Aw, come on.  Where's your sense of humor?
   [shakes the bag]  Oooooooh...
   [pulls the bag out of reach]  Whoooooo!!  Heh heh heh...

% Driving home, Homer still has mud splotches on his head and shirt.

H: That's the last time I ever take you kids to the zoo.
M: Calm down, Homer.
H: I've had it with them wild monkeys.

% An ``Oo oo'' comes from the back seat.

H: What was that...

% Homer turns his head.

H: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!!!!

% Instead of Bart, it's Bart-monkey, wearing Bart's clothes and hat.

M: Well... Then where's Bart?

% Cut back to the zoo.  A naked Bart lies in Marge-monkey's arms as
% the rest of the monkey-family look on.  (Monkey-Lisa plays with
% Bart's hair.)

B: I love you guys, but really, I'm stuffed.  Thanks anyway.
   I couldn't eat another...

% Monkey-Homer shoves a banana into Bart's mouth.
