Homer:    [gasps, then belches]
Marge:    Please submit their names, along with ninety-five dollars,

          been so proud!  [kisses both of them]  You both deserve a
          big, big reward!
Lisa:     Mom, they put every kid in America in that book, just so

Bart:     [sotto voce] Shut up ...
Marge:    Are you sure?  I can usually smell a scam from two towns

Bart:     Yeah, Lis', she is a smart, sophisticated woman.  [winks at

Eagle:    Bart Simpson, do you know why you've been summoned before

Bart:     Yes, sir.  Because I killed an innocent bird.
Vulture:  Dear Lord!  We just wanted you to put fresh newspaper on the

Eagle:    We're knee-deep in our own droppings.  It's disgusting.

% At the Old Springfield Library, Bart starts a film, "Birds: Our Fine
% Feathered Colleagues" starring Troy McClure.

Troy:     Hi, I'm Troy McClure.  You may remember me from such nature
          films as "Earwigs, Ew!", and "Man Versus Nature:  The Road to
          Victory".  In all the animal kingdom, no mother is more
          devoted than the blue jay.  Valuing her eggs above even her
          own life, the mother bird regularly fights off such fearsome
          predators as the badger and the mongoose.
          [visiting a mother blue jay in a tree, Troy puts both a
          badger and a mongoose on the branch next to her.  The mother,
          indeed, stands up and chases them off]
          Of course, one thing Mother blue jay can't defend against is
          a set of steel tongs.
          [Troy lifts the bird off its nest with a pair of tongs; we
          get a look at her eggs as he holds her in the air, squawking]
          Eggs.  Precious eggs.  If they're to survive, they require
          the gentle warmth and tender love that only a mother can
          provide.  Or better yet, a seventy-five watt bulb.
-- "Bart, the Mother"

% Inside a lab, Troy places the eggs and nest, sans mother, inside a
% small glass box lit by a light bulb.  He looks up and sees the camera.

Troy:     Oh, hello!  In a few days, our eggs will hatch into
          nestlings, like these over here.  [walks to a cage of
          chirping birds]
Billy:    They look awfully hungry, Mr. McClure.
Troy:     They sure are, Billy.  In nature, their mother would
          regurgitate food for them to eat.
Billy:    That's gross!
Troy:     [laughs uproariously] It sure is, Billy.  It sure is.

and local citizens couldn't be happier!  It seems the rapacious
reptiles have developed a taste for the common pigeon, also known as
the feathered rat, or the gutterbird.  For the first time, citizens
need not fear harassment by flocks of chattering disease-bags.
-- Kent Brockman, "Bart, the Mother"

% Some time later, the city honors Bart for his work.

For decimating our pigeon population, and making Springfield a less
oppressive place to while away our worthless lives, I present you with
this scented candle.
-- Mayor Quimby, "Bart, the Mother"

% Away from the speech, Skinner and Lisa talk.

Skinner:  Well, I was wrong.  The lizards are a godsend.
Lisa:     But isn't that a bit short-sighted?  What happens when we're
          overrun by lizards?
Skinner:  No problem.  We simply release wave after wave of Chinese
          needle snakes.  They'll wipe out the lizards.
Lisa:     But aren't the snakes even worse?
Skinner:  Yes, but we're prepared for that.  We've lined up a fabulous
          type of gorilla that thrives on snake meat.
Lisa:     But then we're stuck with gorillas!
Skinner:  No, that's the beautiful part.  When wintertime rolls around,
          the gorillas simply freeze to death.
-- The Cirrrrcle of Liiiiiife ... "Bart, the Mother"

% Lisa sighs to herself at Skinner's explanation, and later joins her
% family on the sidewalk for a walk to the car.

Homer:    I'm proud of you boy.  [sniffs candle]  Mmm ... loganberry.
Lisa:     I don't get it, Bart.  You got all upset when you killed one
          bird, but now you've killed tens of thousands, and it doesn't
          bother you at all.
Bart:     Hey, you're right ... I call the front seat!
Lisa:     You had it on the way over!
-- "Bart, the Mother"

% As the Simpsons get into the car, a pigeon is mauled to death by a
% large group of hungry lizards on the sidewalk behind them.  Fade out.
