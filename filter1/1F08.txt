% An old newsreel film is shown.

The News On Parade Corporation presents "News On Parade Corporation
News".
-- A newsreel's introduction, "$pringfield"

% The narrator continues: "Bringing you the world of current events," as
% an atomic bomb explodes in the background and a smiling soldier in the
% foreground collapses, "new gadgets," showing a family watching a train
% approach them on a small television; they raise their hands in fright
% when the train reaches the camera, "and Hollywood. look: it's Amos
% from radio's 'Amos and Andy'!" the narrator says, and Amos greets us:
% "Hello, everybody!"

Springfield: City On the Grow.  It's a proud day as Springfield is
declared one of America's four hundred fastest-growing cities.
And why not?  Business is booming!  Half the country wears Springfield
galoshes.  And say hello to the state's first Aqua-Car factory.  Keep
'em coming, boys!
The city's even in the celebrity business.  Everyone knows Professor
Rubbermouth hails from Springfield.
Everybody's chipping in; even this fellow [a dog with pulling a wagon
with a sign, "I'll pull for Springfield"] has Springfield's can-do
spirit.
So watch out, Utica: Springfield is a City On the...Grow!
-- Shameless newsreel tourism plugs, "$pringfield"

% The newsreel ends, and a young Abe and Jasper walk out of the theater.

   Abe: Hah!  The way people act around here, you'd think the streets
        were paved with gold.
Jasper: They are.
-- Logical conclusions, "$pringfield"

% As if to prove Jasper's point, a car tries unsuccessfully to brake,
% but the shiny street surface is too slippery.
%
% 1993 fades in and Abe and Jasper age forty years in a blink.  The
% formerly tranquil background is polluted with gunfire and a siren.
% The two old men encounter a street bum.

Bum: Got any spare change, man?
Abe: Yes!  And you ain't gettin' it.  Everybody wants something for
     nothing.
      [Abe walks into the social security building] I'm old: gimme gimme
     gimme!
-- Everybody indeed, "$pringfield"

% At the power plant, Homer is in the bathroom, humming.

Hey!  _There's_ something you don't see in a toilet every day.
-- Homer at the power plant, "$pringfield"

% It's a pair of horn-rimmed glasses.

Homer: Anyone lose their glasses?  [no one answers]
       Last chance!  [still no one answers]
       Woo-hoo!
        [Homer fishes the glasses out of the toilet.  He puts them on]
       The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles
       triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
  Man: That's a _right_ triangle, you idiot!
Homer: D'oh!
-- Reverting to Homercles the Greek, "$pringfield"

% Mr. Burns says farewell to a distinguished guest.

   Burns: Thank you so much for visiting our plant, Dr. Kissinger.
   Henry: It was fun.
Smithers: We'll let you know if your glasses turn up.
   Henry: Er, yes, well, I'm sure I left them in the car.  [sotto voce]
          No one must know I dropped them in the toilet; not I, the man
          who drafted the Paris Peace Accord.
-- Material for the National Enquirer, "$pringfield"

% Burns and Smithers grunt awkwardly for a few seconds, eventually
% closing the door on Dr. Kissinger.

Smithers: Sir, bad news from accounting: the economy's hit us pretty
          hard.
   Burns: Heh, tough times, huh?  I've lived through twelve recessions,
          eight panics, and five years of McKinleynomics.  I'll survive
          this.
Smithers: Even so, sir, we _could_ stand to lay off a few employees.
   Burns: [enthusiastic] Oh, very well!  [points at some monitors] Lay
          off him, him, him, him --
           [sees Homer wearing Kissinger's glasses]
          Hmm...better keep the egghead.  He just might come in handy.
-- An effective disguise, "$pringfield"

% Lisa tries to dissuade Homer.

 Lisa: Dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you.
Homer: [to Bart] Lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean
       you can tell me what to do.
 Bart: I'm Bart.
 Lisa: [snatching them] Gimme those!
Scott: And finally, Henry Kissinger was hospitalized today after walking
       into a wall.
-- Cause and effect, "$pringfield"

 Scott: And now over to Kent Brockman for some grim economic news.
  Kent: Scott, things aren't as happy as they used to be down here at
        the unemployment office.  Joblessness is no longer just for
        philosophy majors.  _Useful_ people are starting to feel the
        pinch.
Barney: I haven't been able to find a job in six years.
  Kent: Hmph.  And what training do you have?
Barney: Five years of modern dance, six years of tap.
-- Have you considered Broadway?, "$pringfield"

The economic slump began last spring when the government closed Fort
Springfield, devastating the city's liquor and prostitution industries.
 [Shot shows prostitutes holding signs]
Now, at the risk of being unpopular, this reporter places the blame
squarely on you, the viewers!
-- Kent Brockman editorializes, "$pringfield"

% A town meeting is held to decide how to handle the economic slump.

  Quimby: I propose that I use what's left of the town treasury to move
          to a more prosperous town and run for mayor.  And, er, once
          elected, I will send for the rest of you.
Audience: Boo!
    Lisa: Excuse me, Mr. Mayor --
  Quimby: The chair recognizes the little chick with the gleam of hope
          in her eyes.
    Lisa: This piggy bank contains fifteen dollars I've saved from my
          allowance.  It isn't much, but I would like to help.
  Quimby: Aw, just what I need to tip the skycaps.
-- The Mayor distinguishes himself, "$pringfield"

I'll tell you what made this town great!  Good old-fashioned gumption.
there's nothing here a little elbow-grease won't fix.  So let's roll up
our sleeves and -- [falls asleep standing up]
-- Abe's pep rally, ruined by narcolepsy, "$pringfield"

% Mayor Quimby doesn't agree.

 Quimby: People, people: let's be a little more realistic.
Skinner: Now, I, uh, hesitate to bring this up, but a number of cities
         have rejuvenated their economies with, er, legalized gambling.
          [Everyone talks excitedly]
         There _is_ an added bonus: some of the revenue can go to help
         our underfunded public schools.
          [Everyone stares stonily]
  Patty: {Well, I liked the part about the gambling.}
-- Principal Skinner: one for two, "$pringfield"

% Just to make sure it's OK with God, Ned checks with Rev. Lovejoy.

     Ned: What do you think, reverend?
 Lovejoy: Once something has been approved by the government, it's no
          longer immoral.
Audience: Yay!
   Burns: By building a casino, I could tighten my stranglehold on this
          dismal town!
Audience: Yay!
  Barney: {[burps]}
Audience: {Yay!}
-- No one fickle here, "$pringfield"

% Quimby bangs his gavel to restore order.

  Quimby: Well now, are there any objections?
           [Everyone grumbles, "Marge Simpson..."]
   Marge: Actually, I think it might really help our economy.
           [Everyone sounds surprised]
  Quimby: Very well, then: instead of fleeing this town, I'll sit back
          and grow fat off kickbacks and slush funds.
Audience: Yay!
-- And everyone is happy!, "$pringfield"

% The audience departs, cheering.

Marge: This could be a whole new beginning for Springfield.
Homer: And you know what the best part is?  We've really done something
       for the children.
-- Advantages of legalized gambling, "$pringfield"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 5:27]
%
% Mayor Quimby takes Mr. Burns for a stroll along the prospective site
% for the new casino.

 Quimby: We're thrilled you've decided to build your casino on our
         waterfront.
  Burns: Oh, I'll never forget my carefree boyhood days on this old
         boardwalk.
          [flashback to Mr. Burns driving a bumper car -- straight into
         the legs of a workman]
Workman: Why you -- oh!  Master Burns.  I mean, carry on!
          [Young Burns smashes him repeatedly] Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  Oh, me
         leg's gone gimpy.  Who will provide for me little ones?
-- Burns the sadist, "$pringfield"

% Young Burns laughs evilly, and old Burns laughs as he remembers.  His
% laughter continues in the shower later that day, in bed that night, in
% church on Sunday, and at his desk on Monday as he pounds his desk in
% merriment.  "What was I laughing at now?...Oh yes, that crippled
% Irishman!"  He breaks into hysterical mirth again.

  Smithers: Sir, the designers are here with some prototypes for your
            casino.
      Brit: Gentlemen, I give you Brittania!  Gambling with all the
            glitz and glamour of the British Isles.  Best of all, the
            waitresses and showgirls are all real Brits -- fresh from
            the streets of Sussex, they are.
     Woman: Freshen your drink, Guv'ner?
     Burns: Get out.
     Hippy: OK, all right, wait, now -- now dig this, man --
     Burns: Get out.
     Hippy: Ho ho, wow, oh, let me just get my head together.
     Burns: Now!
McAllister: I'll need three ships and fifty stout men.  We'll sail
            'round the Horn and return with spices and silk, the likes
            of which ye have never seen.
     Burns: We're building a casino!
McAllister: Arr...can you give me five minutes?
-- One bad design after another, "$pringfield"

% Mr. Burns is unimpressed.  "Idiots.  I'll design it myself!  I know
% what people like: it's got to have sex appeal and a catchy name."  He
% calls it "Mr. Burns' Casino", and makes a giant mermaid statue of
% himself in the center of a fountain.
%
% Lisa talks to Marge at home.

 Lisa: Mom, we're having a geography pageant at school, and I don't know
       which state to go as.
Marge: In honor of legalized gambling, why not go as the state of
       Nevada?
 Lisa: No: Nevada makes my butt look big.
-- Texas would be worse, "$pringfield"

Marge: Then how about going as Florida?  You enjoy orange juice, old
       people like you --
 Lisa: Dad, what do _you_ think?
Homer: Shh!  I'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.
Marge: Why?
Homer: I got a job at Burns' casino.  As you know, it's been my lifelong
       dream to become a blackjack dealer.
Marge: Your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on "The Gong Show",
       and you did it in 1977, remember?
        [Flashback to Homer and Barney playing a giant harmonica,
       wearing a pair of two-man large overalls, getting gonged and
       booed]
Homer: We got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on
       fire.
-- Something to be proud of, "$pringfield"

% At Burns' casino, Otto meets the official greeter.

Gerry: Hello.  I'm retired heavyweight boxer Gerry Cooney.  Welcome to

 Otto: Er, great.  See ya!

          busts!  Looks like you all win again.
   Texan: Yee-haw!  Homer, I want you to have my lucky hat.  I wore it
          the day Kennedy was shot, and it always brings me good luck.
   Homer: Why thanks, Senator!  Oh -- looks like my shift is over.
Everyone: Uh oh.  [they all leave]
-- Taking a break, gentlemen?, "$pringfield"

% sleeping peacefully in Africa.  Behind her two men approach in a jeep.
% "Hey, tiger!" one of them calls out, "Wake up!"  He shoots a

% Bart plays a slot machine with a quarter he finds.

Bart: Woo-hoo!  Jackpot.
 Kid: Wait a minute: are you over 21?
Bart: Are you?
 Kid: I'm not authorized to answer that.

% But Bart is tossed into the street nonetheless.

Bart: By the way, your martinis suck!

         were supposed to take those out of the deck.
  Homer: Oh, sorry.  Here's another one.
   Bond: What's this card?  "Rules for Draw and Stud Poker"?
Blofeld: What a pity, Mr. Bond.

% Marge greets Homer at the blackjack table.

Marge: Hi Homey.
Homer: Hey Marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, I
       bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino.
Marge: I was for the casino.
Homer: Strike three, Marge!  I remember that meeting and I have a
       photographic memory.
        [In Homer's memory, Marge wears a blue dress and has green hair.
       She holds a rolling pin.  Homer's arms are massive]
Marge: Legalized gambling is a bad idea.  You can build a casino over my
       dead body.  Blah blah blah blah blah.  Blah blah blah, blah blah
       blah blah blah.
  Man: For you: it's the President.  [tentacle hands Homer a phone]
Homer: Y'ello?
        [back to reality] And then I said to the President -- get this
       -- Marge?  Marge?
-- No captive audience, "$pringfield"

% As Marge walks away from Homer, she notices a shiny 1992 quarter on
% the red carpet.  "I wonder if they have a Lost and Found?" she asks,
% but she notices the "25 cent" sign above a nearby slot machine.  "Oh,
% what the hey," she reasons, and puts the coin in.
%
% The wheels stop spinning, and a short snatch of victory music sounds.
% Four quarters drop into the tray, and Marge seems impressed.  She
% walks out the sliding doors of the casino, but looking at her watch,
% she decides she has time for a couple more turns on the slot machine.
%
% Bart's casino is doing well.  A lighted sign announces, "Tonight:
% Milhouse.  Next week: an evening with Jimbo."  Inside, under the odds
% board, children swarm around the buffet.  Jimbo uses a rake as a
% croupier stick at the craps table.

Hey, how's it going?  Hey: good to see you.  Hey, friends: looking
lucky.  Hey, what's happenin'?  Love the jacket.
-- Bart the Emcee at his own casino, "$pringfield"

% Milhouse's act involves Snowball II and "The Box of Mystery."  He
% says, "The cat goes in --" but the poor animal seems reluctant to
% comply.  Milhouse tries to force her, but this only aggravates her
% more.  She knocks his top hat off to reveal another similar-looking
% cat underneath it, and the two cats wreak havoc with their claws on
% Milhouse's face while the audience applauds.

Raymond: {Definitely have to leave the table.}

% From the control room, Smithers and Burns watch the patrons gamble.
% Burns' hair is longer and he has some stubble.

Smithers: Sir, you haven't slept since the casino opened five days ago.
   Burns: Yeah, well, I've discovered the perfect business: people swarm
          in, empty their pockets, and scuttle off.  Nothing can stop me
          now -- [paranoid] except microscopic germs.  But we won't let
          that happen, will we, Smithers?
Smithers: Uh, no sir.
-- Good thing they're not in Iraq, "$pringfield"

% Marge stands in front of two slot machines, playing them
% simultaneously.  In boredom, Maggie spits her pacifier into the air
% and catches it in her mouth repeatedly.  On one ejection, it lands in
% a cup full of coins being held by a woman who walks by.  Maggie
% reaches for the woman, but she's already walking away.  She crawls
% into a nest of feet looking for the woman, and Marge doesn't notice
% her departure.

Goulet: Good enough.  Let's go.
-- A Machiavellian ploy, "$pringfield"

% But Mr. Goulet is supposed to perform at Burns' Casino, alongside the
% Concrete and Asphalt Expo '93.  Smithers brings Mr. Burns the bad
% news.

Smithers: I'm afraid Robert Goulet hasn't arrived yet, sir.
   Burns: Hmm.  Very well; begin the thawing of Jim Nabors.
-- Thank God for cryogenic Gomer, "$pringfield"

% Bart rides his bike home with Goulet seated atop the handlebars.  When
% they arrive home, Goulet sees Nelson spelling his name on a board.

Goulet: Are you sure this is the casino?  I think I should call my
        manager.
Nelson: Your manager says for you to shut up!
Goulet: _Vera_ said that?  Hmph.
        {[struggles to climb the ladder up to the treehouse]}
-- You ought to know her well, "$pringfield"

% Goulet struggles to climb the ladder up to the treehouse.
%
% Lisa runs in in a panic.

 Lisa: Dad, Mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume and she's
       not, and the geography pageant is tonight!
Homer: Lisa, your mom still loves you.  It's just that she has a career
       now.  She's a slot-jockey.
 Lisa: But Dad, if I don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the
       state of Florida, I'll be the laughing-stock of the whole school!
Homer: [disgusted] Oh, it's always _something_, isn't it?  First I have
       to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give
       birth to you.  And now this.
-- From bad to worse, "$pringfield"

% Homer tries to sew with a needle and thread, but he keeps poking
% himself.  He tries to use the sewing machine, but he pokes himself
% even more often.  He starts up his blow torch, but it's for something
% on the car instead.  Lisa has to remind him to work on her costume
% again.
%
% Finally the costume is done.

Homer: Hello, Florida!  [tapes an orange to her, but it falls off]
 Lisa: [gasps] I'm not a state, I'm a monster!  [sobs]
Homer: [wipes a tear away] No, Lisa.  The only monster here is the
       gambling monster that has enslaved your mother!  I call him
       Gamblor, and it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws!
-- A man of action, "$pringfield"

% Homer runs into the casino and calls for his wife: "Marge!  Where are
% you?  Damn this casino!"  He punches the cardboard cutout of Robert
% Goulet, knocking it over.  He runs up to a crown-and-anchor-type wheel
% and spins it in anger.  It comes up double stars: "Everybody wins!"
% announces the man working the table.  Principal Skinner is preparing
% to throw the dice at craps, but Homer forces the dice from his hand
% and throws them himself.  "Seven, lucky seven!" announces the
% croupier.
%
% Dave Shutton, the reporter, talks on the phone, and Homer grabs it
% from him.  "He can't talk now!"  Homer states, hanging it up.  Dave
% looks puzzled.  Burns watches Homer's progress across his monitors.

   Burns: Smithers, I don't want that unpredictable lunatic working in
          my casino.
Smithers: Fine, we'll transfer him to the nuclear plant, sir.
   Burns: Aw, my beloved plant.  How I miss her -- bah!  To hell with
          this.  Get my razors!  Draw a bath!  Get these kleenex boxes
          off my feet.
Smithers: Certainly, sir.  And, uh, the jars of urine?
   Burns: Oh, we'll hang onto those.  Now, to the plant!  We'll take the
          Spruce Moose.  [picks up the model] Hop in!
Smithers: But, sir --
   Burns: [pointing a gun] I said, hop in.
-- Inexorable logic, "$pringfield"

% Homer dashes hither and thither, finally seeing Marge parked at one of
% the slot machines.

Homer: [grabbing Marge] Yer gotta redda kid forrad yarrar!
Marge: Homer, what is it?  Slow down!
Homer: [slowly] J'yer gedda ferda redderarrar.
Marge: Think before you say each word.
Homer: You broke a promise to your child.
Marge: What?
Homer: You promised Lisa to help her with her costume.  You made her
       cry.  Then I cried.  Then Maggie laughed -- she's such a little
       trooper.
-- Maggie the Brave, "$pringfield"

% Marge is aghast.  "I didn't realize.  I'm so sorry."

Homer: Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem.
Marge: You know, you're right, Homer.  Maybe I should get some
       professional help.
Homer: No, no, that's too expensive.  Just don't do it any more.
-- "$pringfield"

% Robert Goulet performs at Bart's Casino.

[singing]
Jingle Bells, Batman Smells
Robin laid an egg
Batmobile lost its wheel
The Joker got away, hey!
 [spoken] Thank you, thank you very much.
 [hits Milhouse in the face with the microphone]
Oh, I'm sorry, kid...
-- Robert Goulet performs for Bart and his friends, "$pringfield"

% Principal Skinner hands out awards at the geography pageant

Skinner: And special awards go to the two students who obviously had no
         help from their parents: Lisa Simpson and Ralph Wiggum.
  Ralph: I'm Idaho!
Skinner: Yes, of course you are.
-- Ralph and his "Idaho" sign, "$pringfield"

% Marge and Homer walk out of the casino and then along the waterfront.

Homer: You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage I can finally
       look down my nose at you.  _You_ have a gambling problem!
Marge: That's true.  Will you forgive me?
Homer: Oh, sure.  Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches
       from Sears?
Marge: Hmm.
Homer: Well, that's nothing, because _you_ have a gambling problem!  And
       remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he
       was dressed like Santa Claus?
Marge: Hmm.
Homer: Well _you_ have a gambling problem!
Marge: Homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them
       like that.
Homer: Aw, what a gyp.
        [They kiss]
Homer: Remember when I --
Marge: Homer!
Homer: Oh, yeah; I forgot already.
-- Forgive, and...forget, "$pringfield"

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:22]
%
% The music over the closing credits is akin to a Las Vegas show tune.
% Over the "Gracie Films" logo, we hear a slot machine handle being
% pulled and the rush of coins as the machine pays off.
