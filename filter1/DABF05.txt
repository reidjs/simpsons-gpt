% Homer relaxes on the backyard hammock, reading the latest issue of
% "Pie Times."  A commotion out front gets his attention, and he joins
% the rest of the Simpsons on the front curb.  The noise is coming
% from a parade -- the Springfield Gay Pride parade.

Marchers:	We're here!  We're queer!  Get used to it!
Lisa:		You do this every year!  We are used to it.
Marcher:	Spoilsport!
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% This year's parade offers a few things the family may not have seen. 
% There's a float promoting safe-sex, where two men in full-body
% radiation suits safely express their love by shaking hands.  Another
% float, celebrating gays who are still closeted, features two people
% chanting from behind closet doors that are slightly ajar.

Patty[*] +
 Smithers:	We're gay!
Smithers:	            We're glad!
Patty:	                         But don't tell Mom and Dad!
Marge:		Wouldn't it be great if that man and woman got 
		together?
-- But somewhat self-defeating, "Jaws Wired Shut"

[*] By popular speculation; we never do see who's behind the doors.

% Next up is the Lesbians of the Caribbean float, which has a sound
% system playing, "Yo, ho, ho!  It's an alternative lifestyle for me!"
% to the tune of Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean."  The float is
% shaped like a standard pirate desert island, where butch-looking
% lesbians chase their feminine-looking counterparts.
%
% The next float is a salute to brunch.  Lisa encourages Maggie to
% wave at it.
%
% The brunch float is followed by a salute to tight abdomens.  Some
% body-builders show off their "six packs," while Homer moans that
% he's got a keg.  He lifts his shirt to show his beer gut, and a
% horrified gay man puts a screen in front of him.
%
% After the floats, a group of gay dogs marches past the family.  SLH
% is oddly intrigued by them, which freaks Homer out.  He decides the
% family has seen enough, and they leave, dragging SLH behind them.
%
% The family ends up at the Springfield Googolplex, where Homer buys
% four tickets for "Shenani-Goats," even though it's rated PG-13 for
% brief rudeness and appearances by Gary Shandling.
%
% The Simpsons settle into their seats in the theater.  To pass the
% time before the film begins, some movie-related puzzles are flashed
% on the screen.

	[we see a silhouette and the words "MOT HANKS"]
Lisa:	These are so easy.  It's obviously Tom Hanks.
	[the answer appears on the screen:  "OTM SHANK"]
	[confused] Who?
Apu:	Otm Shank.  He is India's answer to Brian Dennehy.  
[slowly] Otm ... Shank.
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% And now, a public service announcement from Itchy and Scratchy.  The
% cat and mouse team is in a theater packed full of other cartoon
% animals.  A duck's cell phone rings, and he annoys the other patrons
% by carrying on a loud conversation.  Itchy resolves the breach of
% etiquette by replacing the ducks cell phone with a stick of
% dynamite.  It explodes, leaving only the duck's skeleton.  As the
% rest of the audience laughs, Itchy slices open Scratchy's gut, and
% uses the cat's entrails to write "Please no talking" on the movie
% screen.  Bart and Lisa laugh, but Homer gets anxious to see the
% movie.
%
% The movie's up next!  But first, some previews for coming
% attractions.

Announcer:	Justin's soccer team was in last place ...
Kid 1:		You suck!  No wonder your parents are getting 
		divorced.
Announcer:	... until they dug up a new player.
		[enter a mummy, wrapped in bandages, and playing 
		soccer]
		Ed O'Neill is ... "Soccer Mummy."
		[James Brown's "I Feel Good" is heard, as the mummy 
		makes some good plays]
Justin:		Go, soccer mummy!  You taught me to believe in 
		myself!
		[a well-endowed woman cheers the mummy, and catches 
		his eye]
Kid 3:		Uh-oh, the professor said not to let him get a 
		boner.
		[cut to the mummy, shown from the torso up.  We hear 
		the sound of cloth ripping.  The mummy shrugs]
		[cut back to the audience]
Homer:		[laughs] I'm laughing ... but it's a laugh of 
		impatience.  Show the movie!
-- The mirthless laugh of the damned, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% But the previews just grind on and on.

Homer:		[muttering under his breath] So many previews, so 
		many previews, so many previews ...
Announcer 2:	"And now, our feature presentation."
Homer:		[gasps]
Announcer 2:	If that's a phrase you like to hear, then you'll 
		love MovieCall!
		[Homer screams]
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Homer jumps up in front of the screen and chants, "Start the movie! 
% Start the movie!"  The rest of the audience quickly joins in, to the
% concern of the ushers.

Usher 1:	They're out of control!
Usher 2:	Well, if we wanted to live forever, we wouldn't have 
		become ushers.
-- The few, the proud ... "Jaws Wired Shut"

% The head usher takes out a giant "movie sized" Kit-Kat(TM) bar.  He
% and three other ushers break it into four pieces to make clubs. 
% Thusly armed, they head into the theater.

Homer:	[still chanting] Stop the madness!  Start the movie!
Lisa:	Maybe we should try to calm Dad down.
Bart:	I prefer to egg him on.  [to Homer] Hey Dad, has the movie 
	started yet?
Homer:	Arr-r-r-r-gh!
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Marge, on the other hand, decides to try calming down her husband.

Marge:		Homer, you're going to get into trouble.
Homer:		I'm not scared of those ushers.  What are they going 
		to do -- advance on me?
		[they do]
Usher 1:	This ends here.
-- Any other bright ideas, Homer?  "Jaws Wired Shut"

% The ushers chase Homer out of the theater and pursue him to a park. 
% At the park, Mayor Quimby and boxer Drederick Tatum stand next to a 
% large statue of Tatum.  The two men have an audience seated in front
% of them.

Quimby:	And so, for helping to KO litter in our community, I 
	hereby dedicate this statue of Drederick Tatum.  [the 
	audience applauds]
Tatum:	Litter is my most treacherous foe.  I would like to eat 
	its children.
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Homer, fleeing from the ushers, turns his head to taunt them.  Bad
% move.  Not looking where he's going, Homer runs right into the
% statue's metal fist, which hits him squarely on the mouth.  He falls
% to the pavement.

Homer:	My mouth, my beautiful mouth!

% Dr. Hibbert examines an X-ray of Homer's head.

Hibbert:	He won't be able to talk for quite some time.  I've 
		wired his jaw shut.  It's all explained in this 
		pamphlet.  [hands one to Marge]
Marge:		[reading] "So your life is ruined."  [grumbles, then 
		reads a bit]
		[to Homer] Oh, dear, you can't eat solid foods.

		mouth] Agh cnnt ee suhluh foo!  [runs to a suicide 
		machine, which resembles a chair with some 
		hypodermic needles attached]
Marge:		Stop it, Homer!
Hibbert:	Oh, don't worry.  On a man his size, that just 
		provides sexual release.
		[Homer pushes Marge away and injects himself.  He 
		looks satisfied]
-- Hibbert's sex machine, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Back home, Homer finds eating a steak to be a challenge.  He can't
% open his mouth to eat it, so he cuts off a small piece and tries
% snorting it instead.  He succeeds, but looks a little woozy
% afterward.
%
% Bart walks up.

Bart:		Hey, Dad, I'm going to make a human yo-yo.  If you 
		object, clearly say, "no."
Homer:		Nnnn.
Bart:		No objections, eh?  Well, that's great.  [leaves]
Homer:		Uh uhjeh!  Uh heh uhn ujehshn!
		[cut to outside the house.  Bart meets Milhouse, who

-- Kids, don't try this at home, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Later, Homer stops by Moe's tavern.  It's a quiet day -- just Homer,
% Carl, Lenny, and Moe -- when Duffman leaps throws open the door.

Duffman:	Hey, Duff lovers!  Does anyone in this bar love 
		Duff?
Carl:		Hey, it's Duffman!
Lenny:		Newsweek said you died of liver failure.
Duffman:	Duffman can never die; only the actors who play him.  
		Oh, yeah!
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Moe quickly understands why Duffman has paid a visit to his humble
% establishment.

Moe:		Oh, you must be here for the, uh, Duff Trivia 
		Challenge.
Duffman:	That's right, local distributor.  One of you could 
		win a lifetime supply of Duff.
		[gets a card] Okay, chug-monkeys.  What beverage, 
		brewed since ancient times, is made from hops and 
		grains?
Lenny:		How about ancient hop-grain juice?
Homer:		Beehr!  Beehr!  [points to a bottle of Duff] Beehr!
Moe:		Wait a minute, wait, Homer's trying to make a guess.
Homer: 		Beehr!  Beehr!  Beehr!  [he reaches over and opens 
		one of Moe's taps.  Some of the beer splashes on 
		him]
Moe:		What are you doing?  You're getting some kind of 
		booze all over me!
Homer:		Ghhr-hhr-hr.
		[Duffman sounds an air horn]
Duffman:	Time's up!  The answer is ... beer!  Ooh, Duff luck.
Carl:		I never would have figured that out.
Lenny:		Aw, that's the kind of thing you just gotta know.
Homer:		[whimpers]

% It's a little too late for the free beer, but eventually someone
% gives Homer a little chalkboard that he can use to communicate.  In
% bed with Marge, he writes something down and shows it to her.

Marge:	I am not going to make you another sparerib smoothie.  
	Most people with their jaws wired shut don't *gain* 
	weight.
Homer:	[pauses to reflect, and then writes "So, how was your 
	day?" on his chalkboard]
Marge:	[reading] "How was your day?"  Do you really want to know?
Homer:	[nods] Uhn-huh.
Marge:	Well, let's see.  I was in the kitchen counting the 
	corncobs on the curtains, when who should ring the 
	doorbell but Ned Flanders.
Homer:	[writes "D'oh!"]
Marge:	[laughs] It seems he wanted to ban culottes in the 
	schools.
Homer:	[growls]
Marge:	Pardon my French, but sometimes that man's a goofy-doofy.
Homer:	[thinking] She thinks Flanders is annoying!  This marriage 
	just got interesting.
-- Like it wasn't before?  "Jaws Wired Shut"

% The next day, Homer feeds Maggie.  She's so cute, Homer tries to
% give her a kiss, but Maggie's pacifier gets stuck in Homer's jaw
% wires.  Worse yet, Maggie cannot be coaxed into letting go of her
% end of the pacifier.  Even when Homer spins around, Maggie hangs on
% with her mouth.  Then Homer gets the idea to dangle another pacifier
% nearby.  It works; Maggie latches on to the second pacifier.  He
% sits her down in her high chair, and then extracts the original
% pacifier from his dental work.
%
% Lisa comes home from school, angry.

Homer:	[writes "What's wrong?"]
Lisa:	You want to know what happened?
Homer:	[erases the board and writes, "Yes"]
Lisa:	Really?
Homer:	[erases the board and writes, "Yes"]
Lisa:	We were playing four-squares, and I called no double-taps.  
	And Ralph double-taps.  And I said, "You're out," and he 
	said, [Ralph imitation] "I can do a sumbersault" -- Which 
	has nothing to do with anything!
Homer:	[thinking] Maybe a hug will cork her cry-hole.  [hugs 
	Lisa]
Lisa:	Thanks for listening, Dad.
-- The key to effective parenting, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Homer and Bart build a model together.  Unfortunately, it's not the
% same model, and ends up being a boat on one side, and an airplane on
% the other.

Bart:	We've got to coordinate on this thing.
Homer:	[nods] Uh-huh.
Bart:	So, the substitute teacher comes in and says her name is 
	Mrs. Doody, and everyone's looking at me like, "Take it, 
	Bart!  Run with it!"  And it hits me, I've become a clown 
	... a class clown.  And it sickens me.
Homer:	[thinking] Wow, Bart has feelings.  Heh-heh, Mrs. Doody.
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Being unable to talk, Homer is now the perfect audience for one of
% Grampa's stories.  Let's listen in ...

Abe:	Three wars back we called sauerkraut, "liberty cabbage," 
	and we called liberty cabbage, "super slaw."  And back 
	then, we call a suitcase was known as a, "Swedish 
	Lunchbox."  Of course, nobody knew that but me.
Homer:	[writes, "Then what happened?" on his chalkboard]
Abe:	Anyway, "long story short," is a phrase whose origins are 
	complicated and rambling.
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% With the change in Homer's demeanor, Marge decides she can chance
% going to the Springfield formal ball with her husband.  (Last year's
% dance didn't go so well, since Homer and a donkey ran roughshod
% through the place.)  She polishes up Homer's jaw wires, and he taps
% his foot like a dog when you scratch him behind the ear.
%
% The big dance is held at the Springfield Country Club.  The men are
% all dressed in tuxedos, and the ladies wear formal evening gowns. 
% Light classical music plays for the enjoyment of dancing couples. 
% Marge and Homer pause at the entryway to take in the ambiance.

Marge:	A formal -- the one place you can wear a tiara and not 
	look crazy.
Homer:	Uh-huh.
	[Mr. Burns walks up]
Burns:	So, how are we enjoying the festivities?
Homer:	[writes, "So hungry" on his chalkboard]
Burns:	Yes, the music is from southern Hungary.  That's quite an 
	ear; have some money.  [hands a wad of bills to Homer]
-- It pays to name that tune, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% The other high rollers at the event are also impressed with Homer. 
% One aristocrat praises Homer's manners, for he did not laugh at the
% gentleman's googly eye as so many other have.  Of course Homer
% couldn't laugh even if he wanted to ... and he definitely does want
% to.  The jaw wires also force Homer to pass on the hors d'oeuvres,
% which impresses Mrs. Maxtone-Witherball, the socialite.  She
% compliments Marge on her effective henpecking, and invites the
% Simpsons to dine with her some night.
%
% Later, Marge and Homer dance to "The Blue Danube."

Marge:	This has been one the most magical evenings of my life.
Homer:	Iyeen hornee.
Marge:	I don't know what you said, but I'm sure it was beautiful.
-- Beauty is in the ear of the beholder, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% "This is the kind of night I thought we could never have together --
% incident free," Marge says.  Just then, the donkey that helped Homer
% ruin last year's dance shows up, and tries to bait Homer into some
% new mischief.  Homer's a reformed man, though, and turns down the
% opportunity.
%
% Dr. and Mrs. Hibbert dance by Homer and Marge.

Hibbert:	Oh, Homer, drop by my office tomorrow, and I can 
		remove those jaw wires.  You'll be just the way you 
		used to be.
Marge:		[horrified gasp]
		[Hibbert sees Rev. Lovejoy]
Hibbert:	And Reverend, I'll put in those pec implants on 
		Thursday.
Lovejoy:	Super.

% The jaw wires come off on schedule, although Homer's breath smells
% almost as bad as Hibbert's feet.  Soon, Homer is at Moe's Tavern,
% chatting with his pals.

Homer:	And when I couldn't talk, I learned to listen.  [takes a 
	sip of beer] I learned so much about my family.  You'd be

	while.
Lenny:	Really?  Let's try it.

% Homer's story attracts the attention of Lindsey Naegle, who for the
% purposes of this episode is a guest booker for "Afternoon Yak," a
% talk show.  She invites Homer and Marge to appear on the show.
%
% The format of "Afternoon Yak" has the day's guests (Homer and Marge
% this afternoon) seated among the show's four hosts in comfortable

% tea with some of their friends -- and a camera crew, and a small
% studio audience.

Barbara:	Welcome to "Afternoon Yak."  Today, we will meet a

Lisa Ling:	My boyfriend has a metal tongue stud.

		where it counts?  I'm talking down-town!
		[audience cheers]
Barbara:	Marge, what was Homer like before he bwoke his jaw?
Marge:		Well, he was eating all the time.  We'd be making 
		love and he'd have a mouthful of Hershey's 
		miniatures.
Homer:		Krackel was my favorite.
Lisa Ling:	I hope that was the only miniature in the bedroom.
Starr:		I'm talking down-town!

% "Well," Barbara continues, "Marge told us when you didn't listen, it
% led to weckless, weckless cwiminal behavior."  To illustrate the
% point, Marge brought along a film clip of Homer's disastrous attempt
% to make ostrich hamburgers.  After Lenny picks a bird for his
% burger, Homer tries to slaughter it by punching it to death.  The
% ostrich quickly shows that it is capable of defending itself.  Back

		not changing back.
Barbara:	[to Homer] Do you pwomise not to wevive your
