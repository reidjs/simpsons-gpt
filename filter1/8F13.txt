Homer: Don't tell me how to eat donuts!  [starts choking]
Karl:  [matter-of-factly] Hey, Homer's choking again.
Lenny: Isn't there a first-aid chart around here somewhere?
Karl:  Somebody scare him.
Charlie: That's for the hiccups!
-- Remain calm, dough-nut panic, ``Homer at the Bat''

% sign-up sheet.  Homer finally dislodges the donut and eagerly signs up.
% He invites the others to sign up as well, but they don't share his
% enthusiasm.

Lenny: Homer, last year, we were 2 and 28.
Homer: Look, I know it wasn't our best season...
Lenny: Actually, it was.
-- Room for improvement, ``Homer at the Bat''

% Homer tells them that this year will be different.  He has a secret weapon.
% The other employees muse about what this weapon could possibly be...
% Charlie imagines that Homer has a giant glove.  Karl imagines Homer
% is able to sproing from base to base.  Lenny imagines Homer having a

% In the Simpsons garage...

Homer: Come here, boy, I want to show you something.
Bart:  What's that, a homemade bat?
Homer: It's something very special.  A homemade bat.
-- A Homer-made bat, ``Homer at the Bat''

% Homer explains...

It all started last year during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked
myself out of the house.  Shelving myself with a large piece of sheet metal,
I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find!
-- Homer Simpson, Safety Inspector, ``Homer at the Bat''

% A bolt of lightning strikes the tree, and a large branch falls to the
% ground, the point at which it had been joined to the tree still glowing.
% ``Something told me this was a very special, very magical piece of wood...
% that I could make a bat out of.''  Putting his homemade football on hold,
% Homer sets to work planing, sawing, nailing (?), and acetylene torching (!)
% the branch.

Homer: [working to build a baseball bat in the garage]
Marge: Homey, come to bed.
       [scene change:  Marge is in bed, as wood shavings flick onto her
        from Homer's woodwork in bed]
       Homer, go back to the garage.
-- Yessss, master, ``Homer at the Bat''

% Homer shows Bart the bat.

Bart:  [sees Homer's homemade bat]  Wow!  How many home runs you gonna
       hit with that?
Homer: Let's see.  We play thirty games.  Ten at-bats a game.  Mmm...
       Three thousand.
-- Back-of-the-envelope calculations, ``Homer at the Bat''

% At the softball field, the police force team faces the nuclear power plant
% team.  After some warm-up, the umpire briefs the teams on the ground rules.

Umpire: Okay, let's go over the ground rules.
        You can't leave first until you chug a beer.
        Any man scoring has to chug a beer.
        You have to chug a beer at the top of all odd-numbered innings.
        Oh, and the fourth inning is the beer inning.
Chief Wiggum:  [in baseball uniform]  Hey, we know how to play softball.
-- The canonical softball drinking game, ``Homer at the Bat''

% The field is set...

Chief Wiggum: [steps to the plate]
Police radio: Attention all units!  Attention all units!

Chief Wiggum: Turn off that damn radio!
-- Please arrange to have your car robbed only during normal business hours,

% Marge and the kids are in the stands watching the game.  Marge has a
% video camcorder (borrowed from Ned, no doubt) and narrates the game.

And the man wants to hit the ball, too.  [crack!]  And he does.
And there he goes, off in that direction.  And everyone is happy.
-- Marge Simpson does the play-by-play, ``Homer at the Bat''

% Despite Bart's offer to help, Marge maintains that she can handle the
% play-by-play herself.  The police team hit a homer run and shoot their
% guns in celebration.  (``Hey, stop that!'' scolds Chief Wiggum.)
%
% The game is in the bottom of the ninth, two out, the police up 5 to 2,
% the bases are loaded, and it's Homer turn at bat.  It's secret weapon
% time, but when his teammates see that it's his magic bat, they take the
% opporunity to make fun of it.  (``And I have an enchanted jockstrap,''
% kids Karl.)
%
% Homer steps to the plate, and it's a homer for Homer.  (The ball sails
% past the fence to a picnic area, striking a man on his head as he is
% about to eat a sandwich.)  Homer taunts the losing team.  (``Ha ha,
% cops can't win!''  ``Get his licence and registration,'' orders Chief
% Wiggum.)
%
% At home, Homer reviews the videotape as Bart and Lisa admire.

Lisa:  Wow, Dad!
Bart:  Homer, can I get you a beer?
Lisa:  No, <I> want to get him a beer.
Homer: Kids, kids, kids!  You can <each> get me a beer.

% At the Millionaire's Club atop the Springfield Trade Center, Smithers
% informs Burns of the team's success; they need only defeat Shelbyville
% next week to capture the pennant.  Burns' lunch companion is Ari
% Amodopoulos, who challenges Burns' confidence in his team.

Ari:   Would you care to bet a million dollars on that?
Burns: Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting!
Ari:   What, a million dollars isn't interesting to you?
Burns: Oh, did you say a million?  I'm, I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere.
       I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would
       bait each other, and, well, you know how it goes.
       Yes, certainly, a million would be fine.  [handshake]
-- But gambling is illegal in 48 states... ``Homer at the Bat''

% In Burns' office...

Burns:    Smithers, I've been thinking.  Is it wrong to cheat to win
          a million-dollar bet?
Smithers: Yes, sir.
Burns:    Let me rephrase that.  Is it wrong if <I> cheat to win a
          million-dollar bet?
Smithers: No, sir.  Who would you like killed?
-- Burns remembers to phrase it as an ethical question, ``Homer at the Bat''

% Burns had in mind hiring ringers for the team.  He unveils a
% chart of a baseball diamond, with names like Honus Wagner and
% Mordecai ``Three-Finger'' Brown.  Smithers points out that all of the
% plays have retired, and are long dead.  (``In fact, your right fielder
% has been dead for 130 years.'')  So Burns sends Smithers out to scour
% the American, National, and Negro Leagues to find players.  He has 24 hours.
%
% At an autograph session...

Smithers: [whispers in Jose Canseco's ear]
Jose:     I get $50,000 to play one game?
Smithers: That's right, Mr. Canseco.
Jose:     Well, it's a pay cut, but what the hey.  It sounds like fun.
-- For love of money, ``Homer at the Bat''

% Smithers scrambles through the woods and narrowly escapes being shot at.

Smithers: [in the woods, a bullet grazes his shoulder]
Hunter:   Hey, sorry.  I thought you were a deer.
Smithers: Heh heh, that's okay.  Happens all the time.
-- ``Homer at the Bat''

% The hunter is none other than Mike Scioscia, who muses that he sometimes
% wishes he were doing something a little more blue-collar, ``with big

Darryl: Yes?

Darryl: So?
Homer:  Well, are you better than me?
Darryl: Well, I never met you... but... Yes.
-- Any questions? ``Homer at the Bat''

% At dinner, Homer grouses that the whole team worked hard to reach the
% championship game, only to be replaced.  Meanwhile, Maggie feeds her
% Brussel sprouts to SLH.

Marge: What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better
       than you?
Homer: Marge, forget it.  He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger
       than me, and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.
Bart:  You make me sick, Homer.  You're the one who told me I could do
       anything if I just put my mind to it!
Homer: Well, now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's
       a crock!  No matter how good you are at something, there's always
       about a million people better than you.
Bart:  Gotcha.  Can't win, don't try.
-- Lesson for the day, ``Homer at the Bat''

% The team is on the field for practice.  Burns is wearing an old-style

% they all have to earn their spot on the team.  And instead of beer,
% they are instead to drink a special nerve tonic which promotes health
% (though has also been known to cause gigantism, but only in rare cases).

Burns:    Oh, I dunno.  Throw it on the pile, I suppose.
-- Burns has bet $1 million on the softball team, ``Homer at the Bat''

% To help seal the victory, Burns hires a hypnotist.
