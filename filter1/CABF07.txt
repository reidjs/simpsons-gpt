% Sometimes, entertainment is where you find it.  Bart discovers this
% one morning while doing the seemingly mundane chore of filling the
% dog's water dish.  When he turns one faucet, the cold water pressure
% in Homer's shower drops and the hot water scalds him.  When Bart
% turns the other faucet, the hot water in the shower goes away and
% Homer is doused with a cold stream.  Each time, he yelps briefly. 
% Bart quickly discovers that by twisting the faucets the right way,
% he can "play" various tunes with his father's yelling.  He starts
% with "Mary Had a Little Lamb" before Marge orders him to quit
% fooling around and get washed up for the old folks' talent show. 
% "With pleasure," Bart says, and starts "playing" Beethoven's 5th
% Symphony on the faucets.
%
% The talent show at the Retirement Castle is pretty much what you'd
% expect -- various oldsters doing little performance acts.  We drop
% in on a hip old comedian.

Comedian:	Ever notice after dialysis, you get ... the 
		munchies!
		[audience laughs]
Jasper:		He's saying the stuff we all forgot!
Comedian:	You know what I can't open?  Cabinets!  [laughter 
		from the audience]
Abe:		Can he say that?
Comedian:	You know what else scares me?  Everything.  [more 
		laughs]
-- Jerry Seinfeld, c. 2040, "Tennis the Menace"

% Next up is Jasper, who performs a plate-spinning act with a twist. 
% Instead of dinner plates, he uses dental (denture) plates instead. 
% The tense act has Homer on the edge of his seat.
%
% The final act of the day is Abe Simpson.

Abe:		[singing] What's new pussycat?
		Owww-ow-ow-ow-ow!
		What's new pussycat?
		Oh, God, no-o-o!
		[audience claps]
Yiddisha Guy:	Wasn't he great, folks?  Now all the contestants are 
		going to receive extra servings of honey mush.  
		[applause] But there can only be one winner and, uh, 
		since Abe's already standing here, what the heck.
		[hands Abe a certificate]
Abe:		[reads] Wow!  A free auto!
Yiddisha Guy:	Keep reading.
Abe:		[moves his thumb, revealing he has won a "Free 
		Autopsy"]
		Oh.
-- Yippee!  "Tennis the Menace"

% Homer and Abe go right to the funeral home to claim the big prize. 
% They meet with the funeral director.

Director:	[examines coupon] Well, this autopsy coupon appears 
		to be valid.  What other funerary services can we 
		provide for the pre-deceased?
Homer:		Oh, the whole deal!  Coffin, tombstone, anti-stink
		spray ...
Director:	Sir, we prefer the term "casket" to "coffin," and 
		"monument" to "tombstone."  We have all the leading 
		brands of anti-stink spray.
-- A rose by any other name ... "Tennis the Menace"

% Bart amuses himself in one of the coffins -- excuse me -- caskets,
% pretending it's a race car.

Bart:		[making "vroom, vroom" noises] He's heading into 
		Dead Man's Curve!  [makes a hard left, which nudges 
		the casket lid.  It slams shut, trapping Bart 
		inside.  We hear muffled screams as he tries to get 
		out]
Director:	[chuckles] Oh, the living.  Well, fortunately, this 
		model features the Cadaver-Cam.
		[turns on a small TV embedded in a monument.  We see 
		Bart clawing at the lid of the casket]
Abe:		[laughs] Look at him go.
Homer:		That thing got picture-in-picture?
Director:	Of course.  This is the Contempo.
		[demonstrates by switching channels to a basketball 
		game.  The picture of Bart shrinks to the upper 
		right-hand corner]
Homer:		Aw, geez.  How come they never call traveling 
		anymore?
-- "Tennis the Menace"

% Of course, once you have your coffin, you need a place to bury it. 
% The directory shows Homer and Abe around the cemetery.  (Bart
% catches up a few seconds later.)  In a deluxe area, the caskets are
% buried in fresh, unused graves, the monuments clean themselves, and
% the residents' survivors can avail themselves of an optional weeping
% widow service.  If they do, a woman in a funeral dress stops by to
% wail for the deceased.
%
% Abe wants this to be his final resting place.  Homer seems
% reluctant, but the funeral director intimates that God likes people
% who get a fancy send-off.  Abe threatens Homer with a good haunting
% if Homer nickels-and-dimes Abe out of Heaven, and provides his son
% with a sample.  Homer relents, and the group moves to the funeral
% director's office.

Director:	[using an adding machine] Okay, with mole insurance, 
		your total comes to $17,000.
Homer:		What?  Oh ...
Director:	Or you could just toss him in the woods and let the 
		wolves carry him off.  It's really up to you.  
		[turns his back to Homer and Abe]
Homer:		Mr. Salesman?
Director:	[obsequious] Yesss?
Homer:		We're gonna go with the wolves.
		[a pair of wolves gather by the director's window, 
		growling]
Abe:		Beat it!  [shakes his fist at them, and the wolves 
		slink off]
Homer:		Dad, I love you this much.  [extends his arms] But 
		that's just under 900 dollars.  I wish I could go 
		17,000 but hmm?  Hmm?  [indicates his arms don't 
		stretch farther]
Director:	Sir, if I may, think of it as an investment in 
		extravagance.  The Mauso-Palooza can be seen from 
		space.  It will consume as much space as a 
		regulation-size tennis court.
Homer:		Tennis court, eh?
-- A germ of an idea, "Tennis the Menace"

% Smash cut to the Simpsons' back yard, where workers are installing a
% regulation-size tennis court.

Abe:	Aw, I can't believe we went through all that just to wind 
	up with a tennis court.
Homer:	I'll bet you didn't see that coming.
-- You would if you were a "Simpsons" viewer, "Tennis the Menace"

% Abe accuses Homer of not caring what happens to him after he dies. 
% Homer denies this and tells his father if it were up to him, Abe
% wouldn't die at all.  "But try telling that to Killy McGee up
% there," Homer says, pointing skyward.
%
% Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa practice volleying a tennis ball to one
% another.

Homer:	What on Earth are you doing?
Lisa:	Practicing tennis.
Homer:	*That's* tennis?  Oh, then what's the one where the chicks 
	whale on each other?
Bart:	Foxy boxing?
Homer:	Yes!  That's what I wanted.  [anguished moan]
-- Be careful what you wish for, "Tennis the Menace"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  5:06]
%
% Homer adjusts the net so that it's nice and springy.  It's so
% springy that when Santa's Little Helper runs into it, he's bounced
% back several yards.  The Simpsons are ready to play.

Marge:	You know, a tennis court can really make your house look 
	classy.  And it's going to do wonders for our social life.
Homer:	Yeah, it'd be nice to entertain friends and have people 
	over.
	[Ned Flanders approaches the fence between his yard and 
	the Simpsons']
Ned:	Hey, you got a tennis court?
Homer:	Keep walking, Flanders.
Ned:	Will do.  [walks away]
Homer:	Faster.
-- "Tennis the Menace"

% Carl and Lenny, on the other hand, pass muster with Homer.  They
% play doubles with Marge and Homer, and win when Homer misses a
% return.

Lenny:	We win again.  [high-fives Carl]
	[they walk over to a nice buffet table that Marge has 
	arranged]
Homer:	Hey, this was a lot of fun, guys.
Lenny:	Yeah, we never knew nobody with their own tennis rink.
Carl:	So, what happens now?  Is the food free, or do we pay 
	someone?
Lenny:	[kicks Carl's ankle] Course not!  They send you a bill.
Carl:	Well, that's why I asked.  [kicks Carl] That's how you 
	learn, by asking, you dumbass!
-- "Tennis the Menace"

% Later, Homer and Marge play Kent Brockman and Stephanie the Weather
% Girl.  Homer's mind is more on the attractive Stephanie than the
% ball, and the Simpsons lose another game.

Kent:		That's game, set, and match to us.  But the real 
		winners here are Marge's hors d'oeuvres.  [eats one]
Homer:		Wow, how do you come up with such witty remarks?
		[close-up of Kent, showing that he wears the kind of 
		earpiece that lets him talk with his news director.  
		Cut to a news van in front of the Simpsons' house]
News Dir.:	[to his assistant] C'mon, c'mon, hurry up.
		[the assistant types something, and hands it to the 
		director]
		[reads paper] I guess you could say, it's my 
		racquet.
		[cut to the Simpsons' tennis court]
Kent:		I guess you could say, I'm Iraqi.
Homer:		[gasps] Get off my property.
-- Communication breakdown, "Tennis the Menace"

% Bart finishes telling Homer about the school's ban on hats just as
% the doorbell rings.  It's Chief Wiggum and Lou.

Marge:	Chief Wiggum!  Are you here to make a bust of some kind?
Wiggum:	No, we're just, uh, checking.  To make sure you're having 
	a crime-free morning.  Heh.
Marge:	As far as I know.
Lou:	Hey, you know what'd be a real crime?
Wiggum:	What's that, Lou?
Lou:	Lettin' that tennis court go to waste.
Marge:	Would you boys like to play tennis?
	[camera pulls back to reveal that while Wiggum and Lou are 
	wearing their cop shirts, they have on their tennis pants.  
	Also, instead of guns, they are carrying tennis racquets 
	in their holsters]
	Hold on; we'll be right out.
Wiggum:	Let's roll, Lou.  [walks into the house.  Lou follows, and 
	both men discard the rest of their police uniforms to 
	reveal the tennis attire underneath]
	[Wiggum starts humming, then stops] Take it, Lou.
Lou:	[continues humming where Wiggum left off]
-- "Tennis the Menace"

% Marge tries to close the front door, but someone wedges a racquet in
% at the last minute.  It's Mr. Burns and his lackey Smithers.

Burns:		Well, hello, Marge.  Lovely day for tennis, eh?
Marge:		I thought you had your own court.
Smithers:	He did, but he had it converted to a human chess 
		board.
		[cut to stately Burns manor]
Pawn:		Hey, Burns has been gone for a while.
Rook:		Let's make a run for it.  [they run off]
King:		Come back, fools.  Protect me!  [a couple of 
		opposing pieces run over and starts beating him]
-- "Tennis the Menace"

% At the tennis court, Homer plays the jester.  He "surfs the net" by
% balancing on top of it.  And he helps the Simpsons lose another
% match.  Marge chides him to take the game more seriously, but Homer
% compares himself with other lovable sports clowns, like John Rocker,
% O. J. Simpson, and Dorf.
%
% Moe serves up an easy lob.  Homer tries catching it in his pants. 
% He succeeds, but probably wishes he hadn't -- a tennis ball in the
% groin really smarts.  The rest of the guests share a laugh, but
% Marge grumbles.
%
% Later, Chief Wiggum and Lou meet at the supermarket.

Lou:		Hey, Chief, we're going to bust up that crack house 
		tonight.
Wiggum:		We did that last night.
Lou:		Yeah, but this time we got the right address.  Uh, 
		you coming?
Wiggum:		I'd love to, Lou, but I'm playing tennis at the 
		Simpsons' again.
		[pan to the next aisle, where Marge is overhearing 
		the conversation.  Maggie grabs hold of her ears]
Marge:		Ooh, Maggie, are your ears burning?
Lou:		The Simpsons?  You mean the L. A. Clippers of 
		backyard tennis?
Wiggum:		[laughs] Yeah.  They're easier to beat than a 
		suspect in shackles.
Lou:		Pretty easy to beat a suspect in shackles, Chief.
Wiggum:		Well, that's the joke, Lou.  It's on the Simpsons 
		and their easy beatability.  [they both laugh]
Marge:		[gasps]
Mrs. Lovejoy:	[walks up to Lou and Wiggum] I think they enjoy 
		being humiliated.
Mel:		[joins in] I don't know what's sadder about the 
		Simpsons, the fact that we mock them, or that they 
		shall never know.
Marge:		Ohh ...
Mel:		Never, ever, ever.  Ever.
		[Marge gasps, and walks away]
-- Ever.  "Tennis the Menace"

% Marge tells Homer that instead of bringing them respect, the tennis
% court is making them the laughingstock of the town.  Homer is
% willing to accept at least partial responsibility, and Marge makes
% him promise to try to improve his game.
%
% The next day, Homer makes good on his pledge, and practices with an
% automatic serving machine.  Marge advises him to follow through with
% his swing.  She probably should have stressed the importance of
% keeping a good grip on the racquet, for on his next swing Homer
% accidentally pitches the racquet into the machine.  It explodes,
% sending balls flying in all directions.
%
% At that very moment, Dr. Hibbert operates on a patient on the lawn
% of Springfield General.  "This is such a beautiful day," he says.
% "I don't know why we don't operate outside more often."  As if in
% response, a tennis ball lands in the unlucky patient, causing him to
% flatline.
%
% Later, Homer comes home bearing a flyer.  He finds Marge in the back
% yard, vacuuming (!) the tennis court.

Homer:	Good news, honey.  I found a way to prove to the town 
	we're not losers.  I've entered us in a doubles 
	tournament.
Marge:	[stops vacuuming] What!?  We're not ready to compete.
Homer:	Don't worry, the tournament's not 'till tomorrow.  [picks 
	up a racquet and a ball] Okay, get ready for the serve.
	[tries to serve the ball, but he hooks his own pants, and 
	flips them onto Marge's hair]
Marge:	Aghh!  Get 'em off!  Get 'em off!
Homer:	How embarrassing.
-- "Tennis the Menace"

% Homer gives his racquet to Bart and tells the boy to take over for
% him.  Then, he goes inside for a nice beer.
%
% Later, Homer (with beer) and Lisa are sitting at the kitchen table. 
% Marge walks in.

Homer:	I'll be right out, honey.
Marge:	Oh, that's okay.  Bart's doing fine.  You just have 
	another beer.
Homer:	Now that's the kind of nagging I can live with.
	[to Lisa] So Barney's like, "you're on your own, dude," 
	and I'm like, "Not even" --
Lisa:	I don't know what this has to do with the civil war.
Homer:	I'm getting to that.
-- "Tennis the Menace"

% Marge and Bart continue practicing.  Their play is confident, almost
% intense.  Homer wanders into the back yard as the two volley the
% ball back and forth.

Homer:	Looking good, honey!  I think you and I just might win 
	this tournament dealy.  [Marge ignores him and continues 
	playing.  Homer walks to Bart's side of the tennis rink]  
	Hey, Bart!  Yeah, you got your daddy's hustle.  [Bart 
	ignores him too] Too busy to reply, huh?  I know how that 
	goes.  Well, I think I'll go lay out my clothes for the 
	tournament.
-- "Tennis the Menace"

% Homer carefully lays out a set of tennis whites on the bed.  On
% tournament day, however, he gets a surprise.

Homer:	[walking downstairs] I'm ready for the big tournament.  
	[sees Bart at the foot of the stairs.  He's wearing a 
	tennis outfit] Hey, there son.
Bart:	Oh, hey there, Dad.
Homer:	[chuckles] With that little outfit on, everyone's going to 
	think you're in the tournament.
Bart:	I am playing in the tournament.
Homer:	It's going to be tough without a partner.
Bart:	I've got a partner.
Homer:	Well, good for you.  Anyone I know?
Bart:	Yeah, you know her.
	[Marge comes down the stairs]
Marge:	Oh, hello, Homer.
Homer:	Good morning, partner.
Marge:	Um, there's something I should tell you.
Homer:	The name of Bart's partner?  I'm all ears.
Marge:	Well, actually, the name of Bart's partner ... is, um ...
Homer:	Yes, darling.
Marge:	I'm Bart's partner.
Homer:	[panicky] No.  No, no, no.  You're my partner.
Bart:	Dude, I think the lady's made her decision.
Marge:	I'm sorry, Homey.  We'll talk about it later, okay?
Homer:	No-o-o!  [falls to the floor, and grabs Marge's socks.  
	The little pom-pom things from the socks come off in his 
	hands, but Marge keeps walking.  She and Bart leave in the 
	station wagon.  Homer runs after them]
	Traitors!  [throws the pom-poms at the car, and they break 
	the rear window.  Homer runs back into the house and peeks 
	through the living-room window]
	I don't think they saw me.

% Marge and Bart have won the tournament -- but victory comes with a
% price.  Homer, still sulking about the last-minute switch, whittles
% the handle of his tennis racquet to a sharp point.  When his wife
% and son come home, he gives the pair a chilly welcome.

Homer:	Hello, Marge.  Hello, Bart.  How are the tennis partners?
Marge:	Oh, Homer, I'm sorry to hurt your feelings.  [hugs Homer]
Homer:	[pushing her away] Don't touch me.  Your hands feel like 
	salad tongs.
Marge:	I just wanted to win for once.  Please don't take it as a 
	threat to your manhood.
Homer:	[gasps] My manhood!  I never thought of that!
Bart:	We were good, Dad.  They asked us to play in the Krusty 
	Klassic.
Marge:	It's for charity.  It benefits victims of balcony 
	collapse.
Bart:	We can wipe out BC in our lifetime.
Homer:	I don't care about BC.  I care about M. E. -- My 
	Enjoyment!  [runs away, crying]
-- They wiped that out in an afternoon, "Tennis the Menace"

% To deal with his feelings, Homer pays a visit to the family
% psychologist:  Lisa.

Homer:	It's obvious what's happening.  I'm being replaced by a 
	younger, more in-your-face version of me.
Lisa:	Dad, you're just going through a classic Oedipal anxiety.  
	You remember the story of Oedipus, don't you?
Homer:	Well, maybe five bucks would refresh my memory.
Lisa:	[sighs] Oedipus killed his father and married his mother.
Homer:	Eugh!  Who pays for that wedding?
Lisa:	I'm just saying you feel threatened by Bart, but it's all 
	in your head.
Homer:	You're right.  But just to be safe, maybe I should chain 
	him up.
Lisa:	Dad, I think you're overreacting.
Homer:	I think you're under-reacting.
Lisa:	This session's over.
Homer:	This session's under.
