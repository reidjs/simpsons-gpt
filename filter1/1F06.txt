% It's an afternoon at the video arcade!  The arcade is packed with
% kids, some even forming long lines as they wait for a game to become
% free.  Martin plays one of the more intellectual games.

Video Man: Thirsting for a way to name the unnameable, to express the
           inexpressible?
   Martin: [entranced] Tell me more!
-- Martin plays "My Dinner with Andre", "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

% Meanwhile, Bart plays a rather more violent game while Milhouse
% watches.

Bart: Be cool, Simpson...but be _in_ the game, not _of_ the game.
 Man: Bwaa!  No es bueno...Bwaa!

       [George Bush walks on the screen and kicks the corpse]
Bush: [robotically] Winners don't use drugs.

% "GAME OVER" flashes on the screen.  Bart is despondent.

    Bart: Aw, I'm out of money.
Milhouse: Don't say that out loud!
           [Security men watch a bank of TV screens]
   Man 1: Caucasian males out of money in sector four.  Go to code red.
-- Bart and Milhouse at the arcade, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

% Each security guard has a key, and they place them into keyholes
% simultaneously and turn them clockwise.  In the arcade, a siren goes
% off and red lights bathe all the game players in an eerie glow.  Bart
% and Milhouse watch as a door opens and a huge shadow walks out of the
% blinding white light, smoke billowing around its form as its footfalls
% shake the room.  It turns out to be the change boy, and he says, "I'm
% sorry, you'll have to leave," as though reading these words off a
% card.  Bart and Milhouse walk out.

Bart: Oh, man, how are we supposed to kill the rest of the afternoon?
 Bum: You mustn't kill time, boys, you must cherish it.  Seize the
      day!...Can I have some change to go get loaded?

    Hood"

% At home, Homer is surrounded by books.

Ah, finally a little quiet time to read some of my old favorites...
 [Looks at books, picks up peanut jar]
Honey-roasted peanuts.  Ingredients: "Salt, artificial honey-roasting
agents, [excited] pressed peanut sweepings..." Mmm.
-- Homer reads a literary masterpiece, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

% Marge interrupts Homer's fantasy, saying she has to go out to pick up
% something for dinner.  "Steak?"  Homer guesses happily, but Marge says
% the money's too tight.  "Steak?"  Homer guesses again, and Marge says
% with a worried look, "Er, sure, steak..."
%
% Homer turns back to the honey-roasted peanut jar.

Ah, the last peanut -- overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed
brothers.
-- Homer with an almost empty jar of peanuts, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

% He tips his head back, closes his eyes, opens his mouth, and tosses
% the peanut towards his head, missing his mouth.  The peanut clatters
% behind the couch, and after a couple of seconds, Homer observes,
% "Something's wrong."  He gets down on his hands and knees in front of
% the couch and reaches underneath.

               [Homer searches under the couch for a peanut]
        Homer: Hmm...ow, pointy!
               Eww, slimy.
               Oh, moving!
               Ah-ha!  [looks, then says remorsefully] Oh, twenty
               dollars...I wanted a peanut!
Homer's brain: Twenty dollars can buy many peanuts!
        Homer: Explain how.
Homer's brain: Money can be exchanged for good and services.
-- The voice of reason, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

% "Woo hoo!"  Homer chuckles, and he begins to walk out.  But he trips
% on the peanut and lands on his fat can.  The $20 flies out of his hand
% and blows out the window.  While "Flight of the Bumblebee" plays in
% the background, we follow the course of the money as it blows high
% over Springfield.
%
% In the parking lot of the arcade, Bart and Milhouse take turns
% punching one another in the arm.  Both look bored, and Bart says he
% thinks it's wearing a bit thin.  "You think so?" queries Milhouse.
% Just then, the $20 lands in the parking lot five feet in front of
% them, and Milhouse points it out.  "Maybe a plane exploded," Bart
% suggests, but Milhouse is ecstatic: "Our prayers have been answered!"
%
% The two boys strut into the Kwik-E-Mart.  "Hello gents," Apu says,
% "what will it be?"  Milhouse orders a Super Squishy -- "One that's
% made entirely out of syrup," Bart adds.  Apu is aghast, as are all the
% other customers in the store -- even Snake who holds a bag while he
% points a gun at Sanjay.  "An all-syrup Super Squishy?  Oh, s-such a
% thing has never been done," Apu explains.  Bart pushes the $20 towards
% him and says, "Just make it happen."  Apu complies, with some
% trepidation.
%
% He grabs a Super-sized cup and twists the knob on the Squishy machine
% from "Recommended Dosage" past "Unhealthy Dosage" to "Experimental".
% The machine begins to shake as it ejects goopy green liquid into the
% cup.  A man runs out of the store in a panic, and Apu sweats, "She
% won't hold!  She's breaking up!"  But the machine dings and stops
% shaking.  "If you survive, please come again!" he says cordially.
%
% The boys cheer as they walk out.  Milhouse forces a straw into the
% Squishy, commenting how thick it is.  He tries to drink some of it
% through the straw, but he sucks the straw into his throat and his
% glasses fly off.  Bart doesn't bother with the straw; he simply drinks
% straight out of the cup.  "Whoa!  That's good squishy," he smiles, but
% then his eyes start to go wonky and he groans.  His vision trebles,
% and three Milhouses ask him, "What's it like, Bart?"  Bart can only
% stutter incoherently, and Milhouse grabs the Squishy: "Gimme that!"
% He takes a slurp, then groans himself, and his face twitches.

    Bart: OK, we're young, rich, and full of sugar.  What do we do?
Milhouse: [yelling] Let's go crazy, Broadway style!
           [singing together]
          Springfield, Springfield, it's a hell of a town:

% The two young men have a hell of a time: first, they go to the
% skateboard park, where a man in a suit shows Bart a skateboard for his
% approval.  At the VIP video game room, Milhouse plays two games at
% once while a garcon brings him a drink.  The boys go to see "Cats"
% next, and Bart mischieviously starts a cat-fight by spitting some
% Squishy at one of the actors.  Then, they buy lots of packs of
% "Toothless Joe"-brand bubblegum-flavored chewing product and blow
% immense bubbles with it -- so immense that when the bubbles burst,
% they are covered with pink stuff.  Homer happens by, and he sticks his
% finger in it and licks it off.  "Mmm, free goo."
%
% At the 24-hour rub-on tattoo parlor, Bart gets a cobweb and bat on his
% right arm and a snake on his left arm, while Milhouse has a woman on
% his right arm, a globe on his left arm, and a fiery skull on his
% torso.  As they leave, Barney is seen to be walking behind them.

% The next morning, Bart wakes up on his bed, under a blanket.

Bart: [groans] Oh, my head.
Lisa: Tsk, tsk, tsk, the remorse of the sugar junkie.
Bart: Ohh...I don't remember anything.
Lisa: Really?  Not even...this?  [pulls back the covers]
       [Bart is dressed as in a uniform]
Bart: Aah!  Oh, no!  I must have joined the Junior Campers.
Lisa: The few, the proud, the geeky.  [laughs unsympathetically]
Bart: Boy, a man on a Squishy bender can sure do some crazy things.

% At the breakfast table that morning, Bart reconciles his behavior.

 Bart: OK, look: I made a terrible mistake.  I wandered into a Junior
       Camper recruitment center, but what's done is done: I've made my
       bed, and ow I've got to weasel out of it.
Marge: I know you think the Junior Campers are square and "uncool", but
       they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-alongs and flag
       ceremonies.
Homer: Marge, don't discourage the boy.  Weaseling out of things is
       important to learn.  It's what separates us from the animals!...
       except the weasels.

% At school, Bart thinks he has a solution to his problem.

    Bart: All I've got to do is take this uniform back after school.
Milhouse: You're lucky.  You only joined the Junior Campers; _I_ got a
          dirty word shaved into the back of my head.
 Skinner: [gasps] What is it with you kids and that word?  I'm going to
          shave you bald, young man, until you learn that hair is not a

  Edna: Take out a sheet of paper, books under your desk.

% But Ned is quick with kind reproach: "Oops, sorry Bart.  That's a
% Neddy no-no!  You're not allowed to handle a pocket-knife till you
% read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test."  Bart feels sour
% grapes as he looks at the booklet's title: "The 10 Do's and 500 Don'ts
% of Knife Safety," and he scoffs, "Aw, who needs a cruddy knife
% anyway?"  A rhetorical question, it would seem.

% Jimbo happens by, and he volunteers his knife.  He cuts the ribbon,
% and Martin thanks him, opening the box and suggesting everyone share

% Bart happens upon a crowd of people surrounding a man who is clearly

% Bart notices a trend: "Seems like everywhere I go, people are enjoying

% "This should only be used in life-or-death situations," cautions Ned.

% Homer walks by the kitchen door and he notices a piece of cherry pie
% on a plate on the floor.  He walks over to it..."Ooh!  Floor pie!"  As
% he reaches for it, a noose of rope on the floor which he didn't notice
% tightens around his ankle, and he is slung up from the ceiling,
% dangling back and forth upside down.  Santa's Little Helper gobbles

% Lisa and Bart watch an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, "Aaahhh!
% Wilderness!"  In it, Scratchy plays the guitar in front of a campfire
% while Itchy roasts a marshmallow.  It begins to rain and the fire goes
% out.  So Itchy grabs some tent pegs and hammers them through Scratch's
% feet and hands.  He then puts a stick under Scratchy's stomach to hold
% it up, and ties the cat's tongue onto one peg and hammers another
% through his tail.  Itchy then lies down under Scratchy's body as
% though it was a tent.  Although he is dry, the unfortunate Scratchy
% gets hit repeatedly by lightning.
%
% Lisa finds it amusing, but Bart points out an error: "The guys who
% wrote this show don't know squat.  Itchy should have tied Scratchy's
% tongue with a taut-line hitch, not a sheet bend."  Lisa is nonplussed:

% Back at sea, a plane hovers near the raft.

 Bart: A rescue plane!  Get the flare gun!
        [Flanders does so, but Homer grabs it]
Homer: This ain't one of your church picnic flare-gun firings, Flanders!
       This is the real thing!
        [He discharges the gun, and the flare hits the plane and
       explodes]
       D'oh!
-- Homer, Church of Armaments member, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

% Homer reasons they're still OK because the minute they rescue the
% pilot, they'll also see the raft.  But a plane swoops by, just
% catching the pilot before flying away.
%
% {Three dolphins swim up to the raft, and Flanders is relieved.
% "Here's our chance: dolphins always help humans lost at sea!"  The
% dolphins chatter at the humans, and a caption appears on the screen:
% "You're all going to die."  They swim away, and Ned calls out to them,
% "Come back!  Come back!"  They ignore him, and Ned becomes frantic.}

     Ned: {Oh, we're done for, we're done for, we're done diddely done
          for, we're done diddely doodily, done diddely doodily, done
          diddely doodily, done diddely doodily --}
   Homer: {[grabs him and slaps him] Flanders!  Snap out of it!
          [slap!]}
     Ned: {Thank you, Homer...I don't know what got -- [slap! slap!
          slap!]}
    Bart: {[grabbing Homer's arm] Dad, I think he's OK --}
   Homer: {[slap! slap! slap slap!]  It's better [slap!] to be [slap!]
          safe [slap!] than [slap!] sorry!  [slap! slap! slap!]
           [apologizing] Sorry.}
Flanders: {Diddely -- [slap!]}

% Homer pushes a cheese doodle onto a fishhook and Flanders points out
% it's their last morsel.  Homer says, "You'll thank me when we're
% frying up a big juicy fish."  He drops the hook into the water and
% holds the reel of thread to which the hook is attached.  "Godspeed,
% little doodle," sighs Neddy.  A fish bites right away, but Homer is
% too complacent to do anything before the thread is all gone.  "He'll
% be back," Homer thinks.  That night he calls lamely, "Here, fishy,
% fishy, fishy.  We're waiting."
%
% The next day the air is thick with fog.

 Homer: Son, there was something I was going to give you at the end of
        this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it
        now.
  Bart: [gasps] A real Swiss Army knife!  Cool!
 Homer: I stole it from that Borgnine guy.
         [Scene switch to a ferocious bear]
Ernest: Don't worry, kids!  I'll take care of him with my trusty...
        [searches for his knife]...er, er, um, er, uh, hmm.
-- Who needed it more?, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

Dad, I know I've been a little hard on you the last couple of days.  If
I had the strength to lift my arms, I'd give you a hug.
-- Bart to Homer as they near death, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

% Homer begins to warn Bart about the dangers of a knife on an inflated
% raft, but he drops it.  All the blades are extended, but fortunately
% none puncture the raft.  Just then the fog burns off and the sun comes
% out.  Its rays are focused through the magnifying glass on the knife,
% and it burns a hole through the rubber.  Homer watches dumbly, and
% Bart says, "Dad, don't take this wrong, but your expression doesn't
% fill me with confidence."

The foul stench of death is upon us!  [sniffs] Mmm, hamburgers.
-- Homer's famous nearly-last words, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

% Bart sniffs and says, "Hey, wait, I smell hamburgers too!"  Flanders
% and Todd sniff the air and they smell the same thing.

   Homer: According to this map, there's a Krusty Burger on an offshore
          oil rig.
Flanders: That's what you're smelling, Homer!  Oh, if it weren't for
          this blasted fog, we'd be saved.
   Homer: Never mind the fog!  [sniffs] That way!  Steer, there isn't
          much time!
-- The nose knows, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

% Homer uses his super sense of smell to direct them.  On board the rig,
% Krusty paces back and forth anxiously.

Krusty: Oh, I'm taking a bath on this.
   Man: We tried to tell you, these are _unmanned_ oil rigs.
Krusty: Aw, close the damn thing down.  No one's ever going to come.
 Homer: [runs in] Give me seven hundred Krusty burgers!
   Kid: You want fries with that?
-- Just in the nick of time, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

% Bart tells Homer he's proud Homer's his father.  "Go away, eating!"
% says Homer, stuffing his face.
%
% Meanwhile, Ernest Borgnine and the other Junior Campers are settling
% in around a fire.  "It sure is lucky we stumbled upon this old,
% abandoned summer camp."  He suggests they all sing a song, and the
% boys agree.  He grabs his guitar and they break into "Bingo the Dog."
% From the trees around the fire someone watches them.  As they sing the
% end of the chorus, the figure darts out and grabs Ernest.  He screams.
