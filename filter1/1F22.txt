% town.  Hans Moleman walks out of his house, into the heat, and looks
% up.  "Well, you're certainly doing your job today, Mr. Sun," he

% focus through the thick lenses, burning twin holes in his shirt and

% Homer, however, has found a great way to beat the heat: he's opened
% the refrigerator door and put a tent in front of it.  Turning the
% coldness knob to "10", he tapes the tent door flaps to the freezer.
% Bart and he sit inside in their underwear with boxes of frozen food to
% keep their skin cool.

 Bart: Homer, my hat goes off to you.
Homer: It's _cool_ in here, boy.  For the rest of the summer, we can
       live inside the refrigerator.
Marge: [poking her head in] Homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used
       this way...although I must say, it's certainly refreshing!

Otto: Sorry, Bart-dude.  We gotta fill this thing with epsom salts and

Bart: Oh well.  Same time tomorrow, Otto?
Otto: [laughs] No way, man.  One day of summer is all we're budgeted

% have in a pool anyway that you can't have in a bathtub with a garbage
% bag taped around your cast?"  He looks out, sees the kids playing,

% barricades Scratchy behind a brick wall for 3000 years, after which

% Scratchy is old and grey and trembles when they approach, but they pet

 Bart: But I saw the murder and then I saw you bury the corpse in the
       back yard!
  Ned: [weeping] All right, it's true.  I am a murderer!
        [everyone gasps]
       I overwatered Maude's favorite ficus plant, I panicked, then I
       buried the remains.  I was hoping to replace it before you got

 Bart: But I heard a woman scream.
  Ned: Oh?  Well, now that I can't explain.
  Lou: [holding up plant] Found it, Chief.
  Ned: [screams like a woman]
 Bart: Oh.  Well, I guess that explains everything.
Homer: Not everything.  There's still the little matter of the
       whereabouts of your wife.
Maude: Um, I'm right here.
Homer: [sarcastic] Oh, I see.  Then everything is wrapped up in a neat
       little package.
        [everyone looks at him]
       Really, I mean that.  Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.

         [one more kid squeezes in, causing the pool to burst]
        My precious pool and its lifestyle accoutrements...no!
         [everyone grumbles, leaves]
Nelson: [rips off Martin's bathing suit] Ha ha!
Martin: Oh.  The gentle caress of the summer breeze.  [sings]
        The summer wind
        Came blowing in
        From across the sea...
