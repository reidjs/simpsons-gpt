% In the mayhem, Homer knocks a lamp off its stand, sending it crashing onto
% the floor.  Marge inspects the mess.

I am <not> cleaning that!  ...  Oh, who am I kidding.
-- Marge cleans up another mess, ``Homer Alone''

% Maggie lies in her crib, and Marge arrives with a bottle of formula.
% But Marge is unable to remove the pacifier from Maggie's mouth.

When you grow up, you can suck your pacifier all you want.
-- Marge tries to reason with Maggie, ``Homer Alone''

% Success.  While Maggie sucks on her bottle, Marge changes her, then
% places her over her shoulder to burp her.  Maggie belches.
%
% In the kitchen, Marge fixes everyone's lunch.

Marge: [making lunch]  Extra mustard for Bart, sliced diagonally, not
       lengthwise.  Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust.  Double
       baloney for Homer...
Lisa:  [simultaneously] Mom, can you sign this permission slip for my

Lisa:  [simultaneously] [etc] without lunch.
Bart:  [simultaneously] be crushed today if I don't wear my lucky red
Homer: [simultaneously] sandwiches today?  Make them baloney sandwiches, too,
Lisa:  [simultaneously] Mommm!  I can't eat those pimentos...
Bart:  [simultaneously] cap!  Mommmm!  Wheeeere's my caaaaap!
Homer: [simultaneously] can I have two slices of baloney and...

-- ``Homer Alone''

% Marge tells them enough is enough.  She pokes out the pimentos in Lisa's
% lunch meat.  Bart's hat is where he left it, behind the toilet.  Marge
% will sew Homer's pants, but she's out of baloney.
%
% Marge is loaded down with bags, Maggie, and the cat (in a carrier), as she
% goes over her list of errands one last time.  Homer asks Marge to take
% his bowling ball to Nick's; there's a bottle cap stuck in the thumb hole.
% Marge says, ``Can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?''  Homer
% whines, ``Ohhhhh!  Alley balls!''  Marge gives in.  ``Just put it in my
% left hand.''  He does.  This throws Marge's balance out of kilter.
%
% Marge spots the school bus outside and tells the kids to hurry up.
% ``No way.''  ``Never happen.''  The bus speeds off.  Says Bart, ``Well
% I'll be damned.''
%
% With Maggie in the passenger seat (eating the shoulder belt), Marge
% drives the kids to school.

Lisa: Mom, Bart's making faces at me.
Bart: It's a nervous twitch, and I'm a little sensitive about it,
      if you don't mind.
-- ``Homer Alone''

% Bart continues to make faces, prompting Lisa to yell, ``Bart, quit
% it!  Quit it!  Hey, quit it!  Quit it!  Quit it!  Quit it!  Mom!!!!!!''
%
% The car skids to a halt in front of school.  Marge yells, ``<Get!>
% <Out!>''  Bart and Lisa do, and the car speeds off.
%
% Grocery shopping.  Marge fetches fruit leather, cheap imitation orange
% drink, Krusty-brand duck sausage pizza...  When Marge leaves the cart alone,
% Maggie throws things out of the cart.  Including a glass jar.  (*smash*)
%
% Marge goes to Nick's Bowling Shop, to find that she got the wrong Nick's.
% So she goes to the Nick's on the other side of town.  But that's not the
% right one either.
%
% Driving home, Marge turns on the radio and hears jackhammering.  It's a
% headache commercial.  Next station.  ``It's time for another Bill-and-Marty
% Classic Crank Call.''  They call a man and tell him his wife is dead.
% Then laugh uproariously.  Marge growls some more.  As Marge drives, the
% nerve-wracking events of the day swirl around her head.  Meanwhile, Maggie
% tugs on the nipple of her bottle, eventually succeeding in removing the
% top and spilling milk over the entire car (including Homer's dry-cleaned
% bowling uniform).  This proves too much.  Marge yells, ``Nooooooooooooo!!''
% and skids the car to a halt in the middle of the Springfield Memorial Bridge.
% She then calmly puts the car in park and turns off the ignition.  Traffic
% piles up.  A bus driver comes up to the car window and says, ``Okay, lady,
% this better be good.''  Marge roars.  The man backs off.

This is Arnie Pie with Arnie in the Sky.  We've got big problems on the
Springfield Memorial Bridge, people.  Traffic going waaaay back in both
directions.  And look out at the corner of 14th and Elm, because I just
dropped my bagel.

Eddie:  Yes.

% Otto takes the opportunity to sunbathe atop the bus.  A mobster yells,
% ``Come on!  I got a body in the trunk!''  Krusty scolds Mr. Teeny for
% screwing around with the car radio.
%
% Arnie is joined by Kent Brockman.  Kent is lowered from the helicopter
% (wearing a helmet-mounted camera) for an exclusive interview.  But he
% is given too much slack and falls past the bridge.  As they try to

% Homer pushes to the front of the crowd, and Chief Wiggum gives him
% a megaphone.

Wiggum: Try to talk her out of there.

        But don't put your lips on it or anything.
-- ``Homer Alone''

Marge: Homer, is that you?
Homer: [aside] What should I say?
Wiggum: Well, how about, ``Yes, it's me.''
Homer: [through a megaphone] Yes, it's me.

% Homer eventually talks Marge out of the car, and the two embrace.
% ``Cuff her, boys!'' yells Chief Wiggum.

% A mug shot of Marge is taken.  And of her hair.
%
% In a smoke-filled room, Mayor Quimby tells Chief Wiggum to let Marge

% Threats are exchanged.

I hereby declare today to be Marge Simpson Day in the city of Springfield!
-- Mayor Quimby goes after the chick vote, ``Homer Alone''

% Apparently, Quimby won the war of nerves.
%
% Homer goes to sleep.  ``All's well that ends well.''  Marge is still
% upset.  She watches television and catches an advertisement for ``Rancho
% Relaxo'', Springfield's only two-star health spa.

% She shuts off the television and wakes Homer.  She says she needs a
% vacation.  Homer reminds her that the family just took a vacation.

Marge: I need to unwind.
Homer: I knw you do, Marge, but come on, you know what our vacations are
       like.  Those three monsters in the back seat.  ``Are we there yet?
       Are we there yet?''  And let's face it, I'm no day at the beach
