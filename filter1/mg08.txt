% The Simpsons backyard.  From left to right, Homer, Lisa, Maggie, and Bart.
% Homer tosses a football jauntily in his hand.

H: Go for it, Bart.  Go out for the looong bomb!
B: Okay, Dad!

% Bart runs off stage right as Homer heaves the ball with all his might.
%
% Close-up on Homer, calling with his hand by his mouth.

H: Atta boy, Bart!  Catch this one and I'll buy you all chocolate milkshakes!

% Cut to Bart, running along the grass, his arms outstretched in front of
% him, and his head turned to watch the ball.

B:  Oh-boy, oh-boy, oh-boy, oh-boy, oh-boy, **oomph**

% Bart runs into a tree.  But he immediately recovers and continues as
% before.

B: [pant]  [pant]  **oomph**

% He runs into a post, but immediately recovers and continues, not once
% taking his eye off the ball.

B: [pant]  [pant]  **hulp**

% Bart runs into a brick wall.  He collapses on his back, streams of
% pain radiating from his body.  The ball bounces off the wall.

H: [o.s.]  Next time, put a little effort into it, boy!

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:23]
%
% Same set-up as before.

H: Catch this one, and we all get chocolate milkshakes!

% Bart runs off stage right.  Homer throws the ball.  Bart runs along
% the grass as before.  Cut back to Homer and Lisa watching.

H+L: Faster, Bart!  Faster!

% Bart runs faster.

H+L: Fence, Bart!  Fence!

% Bart hurdles the fence.

H+L: Ditch, Bart!  Ditch!

% Bart leaps over a huge ditch.  (Looks more like two cliffs a few feet
% apart.)

H+L: Dog, Bart!  Dog!

% Bart leaps into the air, avoiding a dog, which gnashes its teeth
% futilely.  (Bart stays in the air for about two seconds.  Impressive.)

H+L: Cliff, Bart!  Cliff!

% Bart jumps off the cliff and remains syspended in midair.  At least,
% long enough for him to realize his mistake, upon which he falls like
% a rock.  (Standard cartoon technique.)

B: Aaaauuuuuuugggggghhhhhh!!!!!!!

% The football also goes over the cliff.  We heard a *thud*.
%
% Bart is on his back at the bottom of the cliff.  The football lands a
% few feet away.

H: That boy just don't listen.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:51]
%
% Third time's a charm?  Bart's head is visibly bruised.

H: Come on, Bart.  Catch the ball so we can all go out for some frosty
   chocolate milkshakes.
L: [angrily] Yeah, Bart.
H: Start runnin', boy!

% Bart runs off stage right, and Homer heaves the ball yet again.  (*ungh!*)
%
% Lisa plays cheerleader, sans pom-poms, hopping from one leg to another.
% Maggie mimics Lisa, but silently.

L: Go, Bart!  Go!  Go, Bart!  Go!

% Maggie falls as a result of the difficult balancing necessary to hop from
% one leg to another.

H: Atta boy!  Chocolate milkshakes, here we come!

% Lisa's cheering continues in the background as Bart runs along the grass.
%
% Bart's eye view of the football closing in.  The football hits the camera.

B: [o.s.] Ungh!

% Lisa raises her arms in triumph.

L: Yaaaay!  He caught it!!

% Bart is flat on his back, the football seriously wedged into his mouth.
% The usual collection of stars and spirals around Bart's head.
% Homer is disappointed.

H: [o.s.]  When I said catch, I meant with your hands.

% Bart raises his head and tries to respond, but it just comes out as
% ``Mmmph.  Mmph.  Mmmph.''

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 1:14]
%
% In the ice cream parlor.  (A sign on the wall has a picture of a milkshake
% and the caption $1.89.  The window has ``Parlor'' written backwards; the
% words ``Ice Cream'' are above the picture frame and aren't visible.)
% From left to right, Homer, Maggie, and Lisa.  Everyone has a strawberry
% shake in front of them.  Homer eats his with a spoon (notice the spilt
% milkshake near Homer's cup); the girls drink theirs through a straw.
% Maggie holds her pacifier in her left hand.

H: Well, Bart, you put in a good effort today, so we're all being rewarded.

% Homer eats his spoonful of milkshake.  Maggie squeals with delight.

L: Good slurpee.
H: Bart, you're not touching your milkshake.  Aren't you hungry?

% The camera pans across the table to Bart, who has a milkshake in front of
% him and the football still wedged in his mouth.  Bart raises his arms and
% tries to protest, but all we hear are muffled tones.

H: Well, if <you> won't drink it, I will!

% Bart continues to protest, but we can't make out what he's trying to say.
% With an evil smirk, Lisa reaches over and shoves the straw into his mouth
% around the football.  Bart starts drinking his milkshake.
