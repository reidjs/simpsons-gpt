        A snake in the cash register!  [everyone laughs]

        tonight.
Barney: Hey Moe, you want to smell my flower?
   Moe: _Do_ I?!  [walks over]
         [Barney holds a lighter under Moe's chest]
        Ooh!  I'm burning up here.  Ooh!  [everyone laughs]
        Aw, taking advantage of my alcohol-soaked clothes.  Ho, ho, it's
        funny _and_ it makes you think.  Oh, I need some coffee before I
        pass out.  Homer, pass me the sugar.
 Homer: [unscrewing lid] This is going to be great!
         [Moe pours sugar in his cup; a whole lot comes out]
Barney: Oh, jeez.
   Moe: Aw, there's sugar all over the bar now.
 Lenny: That's not funny, Homer.
Barney: Yeah!  We were just messing around, and you had to go too far.

     Moe: How many people want Homer banned from this place for life?
Everyone: Yeah!
   Homer: Aw, come on, everybody.  This bar is like a tavern to me.
     Moe: Sorry, Homer, you should have thought of that before you gave
          me the old sugar-me-do.  I'm taking your caricature down from
          Mount Lushmore [does so] and I'm taking your favorite song out
          of the juke box.
   Homer: [gasps] "It's Raining Men"?
     Moe: Yeah, not no more it ain't.

% Bart tries to console his father.

 Bart: Cheer up, Homer.
Homer: Can't.
 Bart: [happily] OK.
Marge: What if you pretended that this couch were a bar?  Then you could
       spend more nights at home with us.  Huh?
Homer: I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
 Lisa: Look on the bright side, Dad.  Did you know that the Chinese use
       the same word for "crisis" as they do for "opportunity"?
Homer: Yes!  Cris-atunity.
-- Something like that, anyway, "Fear of Flying"

Homer: You're right.  I've been wasting my life away in that dump for
       years.  That's it!  I'm going to find a _new_ bar to drink in,
       and I'm going to get drunker than I've ever been in my entire
       life!  Bart!  Where's my wallet?
 Bart: [pulling it from his own pocket] Right here, Dad!
Homer: Thank you!

Homer: Ooh, this looks like a nice friendly place.
Carla: Sammy, you're too old to go on a date with two twins on the same

  Sam: OK, Carla, I'll make you a bet: if this affects my major league
       comeback, I'll sell my bar.
 Norm: Woody...gimme a beer.
Woody: I think you've had enough, Mr. Peterson.  My chiropractor says I

Woman: What was her problem?

  Guy: Greetings, good men.  Might I trouble you for a drink?
  Moe: Oh, get out of here, Homer.
  Guy: Homer?  Who is Homer?  My name is Guy Incognito.

% Homer's quest takes him to the airport.

        Homer: The last bar in Springfield...if they don't let me in
               here, I'm going to have to quit drinking!
Homer's liver: Yay!
        Homer: Shut up, liver!  [punches it] Ow!  My liver hurts...
                [walks in] I'd like a beer, please.
    Bartender: Uh, sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink in here.
        Homer: Um, but I _am_ a pilot.
    Bartender: Where's your uniform?
        Homer: Um...I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.

  Man: Conditions are a little windy.
        [pilots all go, "Well", "I dunno", "Never mind", etc.]
  Man: [to Homer] You!
Homer: [now dressed as a pilot] But I --
  Man: Hey...you're not just impersonating a pilot so you can drink
       here, are you?
Homer: Yeah.  That's exactly why I'm here.

 Alan: Hi, I'm Alan.  I'm your copilot.
Homer: Uh, yeah, uh, hmm.  Er, uh, as a change of pace, I'm going to let
       you do most of the work.  I think you're ready for it, Alan.
        [Alan makes a face]
       And, um, I'll just get us started.

% A senior airline official talks to Homer in his office.

Official: If word gets out about this, Krazy Klown Airlines will be a
          laughingstock.  In exchange for your silence, I'm prepared to
          offer your family free tickets to anywhere in the United
          States.  Excluding Alaska and Hawaii, the freak states.
   Homer: Woo hoo!
           [at home]
          Good news, everybody!  Because I endangered lives, we can fly
          anywhere we want!
    Bart: Alaska!
    Lisa: Hawaii!
-- Well, _almost_ anywhere, "Fear of Flying"

% Marge seems less than keen.

Marge: Er, I don't know, Homer.  We're right in the middle of the busy
       housekeeping season.
Homer: But Marge, you deserve a vacation.  It's a chance for you to
       clean up after us in a whole other state!
Marge: I don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like
       that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden.
Homer: Come on, Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse
       town.  I want to explore the world.  I want to watch TV in a
       different time zone.  I want to visit strange, exotic malls.  I'm
       sick of eating hoagies.  I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long
       hero...I want to _live_, Marge!  Won't you let me _live_?  Won't
       you please?!
-- Passionate pleas, "Fear of Flying"

% So Marge, of course, gives in.  Homer chomps peanuts contentedly.

Homer: So, Marge, pretty sweet, eh?
Marge: Hmm.  Oh, I forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer.  If
       someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a
       fire.
        [a baby starts crying]
 Bart: Oh, great.  I specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby.
        [camera pulls back to reveal Maggie crying]
  Abe: [looking out window] Wow...we must be _really_ flying high!
       Those people down there look all tiny and blurry...just like the

% on, she panics.

Marge: [panicked] I think I'll go get a picture of the plane taking off.

Homer: Marge, what's wrong?  Are you hungry?  Sleepy?  Gassy?  Is it
       gas?  It's gas, isn't it?
Marge: Homer, I've never told you this before, but I'm not a good flyer.
       [pants, gasps] I have to get off the plane.  Let me off the
       plane.  [stands up] I'm asking you nicely to open the doors!
Homer: Take it easy, Marge.  How about if we dope you up real good?
Marge: [screaming] Let me off let me off let me off let me off let me
       off let me off -- [runs up and down the aisle]

 Bart: You know, I have this feeling that we forgot something...
  Abe: [still on the plane] Aaaaah!
Homer: Ehh, I'm sure it's nothing.
 Lisa: Mom, are you feeling any better?
Marge: Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.
Homer: Permit _me_ to solve the mystery: your mother has a fear of
       flying.
 Bart: So much for the days when I could say, "At least my _mother_'s
       normal."
Marge: Well, everybody's got a fear of something.
Homer: Not everybody.
Marge: [to Homer] Sock puppets!
Homer: Where?!  Where?!  Aah!  Aah!
 Lisa: Mom, are you _sure_ you don't want to discuss it?
Marge: Sure as sugar...[laughs awkwardly]
-- No dysfunctionality here, "Fear of Flying"

Homer: Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what
       happened.  Push it deep down inside her, so she'll never annoy us
       again.
 Lisa: But if we don't encourage her to vent her feelings, they can come
       out in other ways.
Marge: I just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog...
       they've been living in sin!

 Lisa: See, Dad, I told you Mom would have problems.
Marge: No, no, honey, it's all right.  Really, I'm fine, I'm all right.

Marge: In a little while.

 Lisa: Mom, can we talk to you?
Marge: Can't talk.  Keeping myself in a state of catlike readiness.
 Lisa: Uh, neat.
-- "Fear of Flying"

   Lisa: Anyway, Mom, maybe you should go into therapy.
  Marge: No, I don't need therapy, I'm fine.  And it's too expensive.
  Homer: And I don't believe in it!  It breaks up families, turns wives
         against husbands, children against fathers, neighbors against
         me.  You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an
         hour to get top-notch therapy.

Psychic: Hello, "Radio Psychic".  You will die a terrible, terrible

   Man 1: No thanks to the plane, many of us are still...
Everyone: Alive!
   Man 2: [through full mouth] We certainly are.  [chews]
   Man 3: Pass me another hunk of copilot.
    Lisa: Dad, Mom's getting worse.  You have to take her to see a real

% The family take her to a psychiatrist the next day.

Homer: [sarcastic] All right, Lisa, you got your way.  Your Mom's going
       to a psychiatrist.  She's going to tell Marge to leave me.  It'll
       break up the family and you'll have to live with your grandmother
       and pick beans.
 Lisa: Dad, I like picking beans with Gramma.
Homer: Well, keep it up, then.
 Lisa: [sarcastic] OK, I will.
Homer: Good.  You do that.
 Lisa: Fine.
Homer: You'll be picking many a bean.
 Lisa: Hope I do.

Skinner: Hmph.  This has nothing to do with you, Simpson.  I have many,

% Homer and Marge meet the psychiatrist.

Homer: All right, how much do you charge?
Zweig: If money's a problem, I charge on a sliding scale.  I can go as
       low as $30 an hour.
Homer: Keep sliding.
Marge: $30 will be fine.
Homer: Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa!  First, what are your qualifications?
Zweig: Well -- [she motions to a wall of diplomas]
Homer: Oh, no.  I'm not here to take a reading test.  I want to see some
       credentials.
Marge: Mph, I'm sorry, Doctor, he's just afraid you'll blame all my
       problems on him.
Zweig: I'm not here to blame anyone.

-- The first meeting with Dr. Zweig, "Fear of Flying"

Zweig: Marge, therapy can be an intense process.
Marge: Uh huh...
Zweig: We're going to delve deeply into your subconscious and we're not
       going to stop until we've exposed the root of your fear of
       flying.
Marge: Mmm...
Zweig: Don't worry.  This is a private sanctuary where whatever
       transpires will be just between us.

-- Homer traps Marge, "Fear of Flying"

% At Marge's next session...

Zweig: Marge, there's no simple explanation for your fear of flying.
       But it can probably be traced to some childhood trauma.  Think
       back...what's the earliest memory you have of something bad
       happening?
Marge: Hmm...that would have to be my first day of school.
        [flashback]
Patty: They got this thing called a "fire drill".  They use it to drill

Marge: Mmm...
Selma: And there's only one big toilet, and they make you all go at the

Marge: They do so!
 Girl: They don't even play their own instruments.
Marge: No...no!
 Girl: That's not even Michael Nesmith's real hat.
Marge: Aah!
        [back in the present]
Zweig: Kids can be so cruel.
Marge: But it's true.  They didn't write their own songs _or_ play their
       own instruments.
Zweig: The Monkees weren't about music, Marge.  They were about

Marge: No I didn't.
Zweig: Yes you did.  And you also infringed on any number of copyrights.
-- Dr. Zweig, psychiatric lawyer, "Fear of Flying"

Zweig: Now...let's talk about your father.
Marge: [hurried] Sure.  OK, I'll talk about father...Father Christmas.
       That's what they call Santa Claus in England.  They drive on the
       wrong side of the road there.  Now _that's_ crazy.  [laughs
       nervously] People are always saying how small England is but you
       couldn't fit it all in here, not by a long shot.  [laughs again]
       You know what?  I'm cured.  [gets up to leave]
Zweig: Marge, get back here and tell me about your father.

-- The shameful truth comes out, "Fear of Flying"

% Back in the present...

Marge: [weeping] My father was a stewardess!
Zweig: Marge, there's nothing to be ashamed of here.  Today, male flight
       attendants or "stewards" are common.
Marge: They are?
Zweig: Yes, thanks to trailblazers like your father.  You might say he
       was a pioneer.
Marge: Yeah...you might even say he was an American hero.
Zweig: Let's not go nuts.
-- Too late, "Fear of Flying"

% Dr. Zweig concludes, "The important thing is that we've pinpointed the
% precise moment when you developed your fear of flying."  But Marge
% starts remembering some other stuff.  As a baby, she remembers her
% grandmother trying to feed her with a spoon, saying "Here comes the
% airplane" but taking a long time to put the spoon in baby's mouth.  As
% a young girl, a toy plane she was riding in caught fire.  Her mother
% takes her to a cornfield once, when a biplane swoops down and fires
% its machine guns at her.

Marge: Do you think those things could also have contributed to my fear
       of flying?
Zweig: [brusque] Yes, yes, it's all a rich tapestry.
Marge: Oh, well, thank you doctor.  You've changed my life!
Zweig: You know, Marge, we've really just begun to scratch the surface.
       There's still the far more serious problem of your husband.
Homer: [walking in] That's OK, you don't have to make her into some kind
       of superwoman.  She can get on a plane, that's plenty.  [rushes
       Marge out]
Marge: Thank you, doctor.  Whenever the wind whistles through the
