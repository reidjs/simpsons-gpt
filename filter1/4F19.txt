% It's time for the evening news, Brockman-style.

Brockman: ... means death for us all.  And now, "Kent's People!"
          Tonight's inspiring story is about Frank Grimes, a thirty-
          five-year-old Springfieldite who has earned everything the
          hard way, but never let adversity get him down.

          [the footage shifts to grainy footage of Grimes as a boy]

          Abandoned by his parents at age four, Frank never got to go
          to school.
          [we see Frank through the rear window of a car.  He recedes
          into the distance as the car drives off.  A hand waves,
          "goodbye"]
          [cut to a still black-and-white photo of young Grimes in a
          delivery uniform]
          He spent his childhood years as a delivery boy, delivering
          toys to more fortunate children.
          [another picture, this one of Grimes handing a package to a
          boy.  A tuxedo-wearing man stands in the doorway]
          Then, on his eighteenth birthday, he was blown up in a silo
          explosion.
          [cut to a far shot of a Grimed running into a silo, which
          goes ka-boom]
          [Grimes rests on a hospital bed, in traction and plastered
          from head to toe in bandages] During his long recuperation he
          taught himself to hear and feel pain again.
          [black-and-white shot of Grimes at his desk, surrounded by
          textbooks]
          As the years passed, he used his few leisure moments each day
          to study science by mail.  And, last week, Frank Grimes, the
          man who had to struggle for everything he ever got, received
          his correspondence school diploma in nuclear physics -- with
          a minor in determination.
          [a postman hands Grimes his diploma.  Grimes holds it
          triumphantly in the air, where an eagle tries to fly off with
          it.  Grimes fights him off]
-- Are you inspired yet?  "Homer's Enemy"

% One of the people watching "Kent's People" that night is Mr. Burns.
% Impressed by Grimes' determination, he orders Smithers to recruit him
% as an executive vice president.  Smithers reluctantly does so.
%
% The next day, Smithers introduces Burns to his newest employee, but
% it looks as though Mr. Burns is still watching "Kent's People."

Burns:    Smithers, I've just seen the most heroic dog on television.
          He pulled a toddler from the path of a speeding car, then
          pushed a criminal in front of it.  Find this dog.  I want to
          make him my executive vice president.
Smithers: Uh, yes sir.  In the meantime, here's Frank Grimes.
          [Grimes offers his hand, but Burns just stares blankly]
          The, the self-made man?
Burns:    What?  Oh, yes, that fellow.  Mmmm, put him somewhere out of
          the way, and find that dog!
Smithers: Yes sir.  [leaves, taking Grimes with him]
-- How quickly they forget, "Homer's Enemy"

% There's no place farther out of the way than sector 7-G.  Homer is
% busy spinning around in his swivel chair when Lenny and Carl walk in,
% suggesting they welcome the new guy.  Dizzy, Homer faintly protests
% the idea, but the three men form a welcome wagon.
%
% In his office, Grimes methodically arranges his belongings.  Homer,
% Lenny, and Carl press their faces against the office window before
% walking in to say hi.

Carl:     You new?
Grimes:   Yes.  My name is Frank Grimes.
Lenny:    I'm Lenny.  This is Carl and Homer.  I'm Lenny.
Grimes:   How do you do.
Homer:    [picks up one of Grimes' pencils, spilling the rest onto his
          desk]  Wow, you've got pencils with your name on them -- just
          like a pencil company executive.  I'd give anything for one
          of these.
Grimes:   [tugs the pencil back out of Homer's hand]  Any office supply
          company can have them made up for you.
Homer:    Can I have this one?  [tries to tug it back]
Grimes:   No.
Homer:    Can [thinks] Lenny have it?  [tries it again]
Grimes:   No.
-- Are you sure you want to work here?  "Homer's Enemy"

% Lenny and Carl look at Grimes' correspondence-school diploma.

Grimes:   Oh, that's my degree in nuclear physics.  I'm sure you all
          have one.
Lenny:    Oh yeah, Carl and I each have a masters'.  [chuckles] Of
          course, old Homer, he didn't need a degree.  He just showed
          up the day they opened the plant.
Homer:    I didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
Grimes:   Um, [forced laugh] yeah.  Well, listen, I'm sure, you all
          have a lot of work to do.
Lenny +
  Carl:   [shrug] Eh.  [the two leave]
          [Grimes turns around, and is startled to see that Homer is
          still there]
Homer:    Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little
          tip.  If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep
          and no one will ever know.
Grimes:   eh, I don't think we're being paid to sleep.
Homer:    Oh yeah, they're always trying to screw ya.  [leaves]
Grimes:   [shudders in amazement]
-- The secret of my success, "Homer's Enemy"

% While Homer helps Grimes settle into his new job, Marge is at the DMV
% office, hoping to get a vanity license plate.  Unfortunately for her,
% "MARGE" is already taken.  So is "MARJORIE".  And "MITSY".  The clerk
% offers "NITSY", and Marge considers it.  Bart had been waiting
% patiently, but decides he's had enough and sets off to find something
% more interesting.
%
% He finds the tax seizures room, where the city is auctioning off
% property.  The auctioneer solicits bids for item 751, but there aren't
% any takers.  Bart bids one dollar -- and wins.  Only after his victory
% does Bart think to ask what he has won.  The auctioneer hands over a
% deed, and says that Bart is now the proud owner of 35 Industry Way.
%
% Bart goes to survey his new property, which turns out to be a
% dilapidated factory.  Impressed, Bart says, "Looks like my years of
% hard work have finally paid off."
%
% At lunch, Homer continues to unwittingly bedevil Grimes.

Homer:    [to Grimes, who's walking by]  Hiya Stretch, what's the good
          word?
Grimes:   My name is "Grimes," uh, Simpson, Frank Grimes.  I took the
          trouble to learn your name, so the least you could do is
          learn mine.
Homer:    Okay, Grimey.
-- Should've quit while you were ahead, Grimey, "Homer's Enemy"

% Grimes points out that Homer has taken his special dietetic lunch.
% Embarrassed, Homer apologizes but takes a few more bites before
% handing it back to Grimes.  Grimes tosses the remainder in the trash
% and walks away.  Homer goes to retrieve it, but backs off and tries to
% look innocent when Grimes turns around to look.
%
% Things don't look up for Grimes when he returns to the office.  He
% follows a trail of chewed pencils to Homer's work station, where Homer
% is using one to clean his ears.  Grimes huffily returns to his office.
%
% Meanwhile, Bart continues to look over his factory.  Inside, the
% building is empty except for Bart, some rats, and assorted building
% debris.  "It's filthy," he sums up proudly, "and it's mine."  Picking
% a bolt up off the floor, Bart sees how far he can throw it.  It lands
% on the other side of the building and makes an echo that emphasizes
% how empty the place is.  Looking around, Bart sees an old wooden
% swivel chair, and a fire extinguisher.  He wheels the chair into
% position, sits down, and uses the fire extinguisher to jet-propel
% himself across the factory floor and into the wall.
%
% At work, Homer propels himself into Grimes' office.

Homer:    So, how's it going, Grimey?
Grimes:   I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my office, Simpson.
Homer:    [laughs]  Wish I had a nickel every time I heard that.
          [walks around idly, making annoying sounds]
          [off key]  Take me out to the ball-game, take me out to the
          ballll ...
          So, what's new, Grimey?
          [alarms blare and red lights go on at Homer's work station]
Grimes:   Simpson, you've got a 513.
          [Homer looks at his watch]
Grimes:   No, a 513.  In your procedures manual -- a 513?
          {Homer looks at his watch again]
Grimes:   [points] Look at your control panel.
Homer:    [looks] Oh, a five THIR-teen.  I'll handle it.
          [calmly walks next door, takes a bucket of water and pours it
          on the console.  This shorts it out and silences the alarms]
          That got it.
          [Grimes looks through the window, aghast]

% At the =other= Simpson workplace, "President" Bart gazes out his
% office window.  Milhouse strolls by.

Bart:     [leaning out the window]  Hey, Milhouse!  You want a job in
          my factory?
Milhouse: You don't a have a factory.
Bart:     Hey, I'm a busy man.  You want a job or not?
Milhouse: Okay!  [runs up to join Bart]
-- "Homer's Enemy"

% Break time!  Homer tries to set the world indoor speed-eating record.
% Grimes looks on, disapprovingly.

Grimes:   God, he eats like a pig.
Lenny:    I dunno.  Pigs tend to chew.  I'd say he eats more like a
          duck.
Grimes:   Well, some kind of farm animal anyway.  And earlier today, I
          saw him asleep inside a radiation suit.  Can you imagine that
          he, he was hanging from a coat hook.
Lenny:    He had three beers at lunch.  That would make anybody sleepy.
Grimey:   I've never seen him do any work around here ... what, what is
          his job?
Lenny:    Safety inspector.
Grimes:   That irresponsible oaf?  A man who by all rights should have
          been killed dozens of times by now?
Lenny:    Three hundred and sixteen times by my count.
Grimes:   That's the man who's in charge of our safety.  It, it boggles
          the mind.
Carl:     It's best not to think about it.
-- Good advice, "Homer's Enemy"

% Homer gropes for a drink, but his hand lands instead on a beaker of
% sulfuric acid.  Oblivious, he raises the beaker to his lips, but
% Grimes knocks it away just in time.  The flying acid spills onto the
% wall, which immediately dissolves.  Burns and his canine executive
% vice president walk by, and the old man can't help but notice the
% break room has some extra ventilation.
%
% Burns summons Grimes to his office, and (with some assistance from
% the dog) berates his worker for destroying the valuable wall, and
% spilling the priceless acid.  He puts Grimes on notice (at a reduced
% salary) -- get his act together, or else.
%
% Grimes confronts Homer at his work station.

Homer:    Hi, Grimey old buddy.
Grimes:   I'm not your buddy, Simpson.  I don't like you.  In fact, I
          hate you!  Stay the hell away from me, because from now on,
          we're enemies!  [turns to leave]
Homer:    Okay.  Do I have to do anything?
-- And that's how he became ... "Homer's Enemy"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  8:51]
%
% Homer stops at Moe's Tavern to lament his newfound enmity with
% Grimes.

Homer:    Oh, I can't believe it, I got an enemy.  Me the most beloved
          man in Springfield.
Moe:      Ah, it's a weird world, Homer.  As hard as it is to believe,
          some people don't care for me, neither.
Homer:    No, I won't accept that.
Moe:      No, it's true.  I got their names written down right here on
          what I call my, uh, "enemies list."  [reaches under the bar
          for a sheet of paper]
Barney:   [takes list and reads it]  Jane Fonda, Daniel Shore, Jack
          Anderson ... Hey!  This is Richard Nixon's enemies list.  You
          just crossed out his name and put yours.
Moe:      Okay, gimmie that, gimmie it back.  [takes list]
          [writes] Barney Gumble.
Barney:   Oh.
-- "Moe's Enemy," uh, I mean, "Homer's Enemy"

% Homer still isn't closer to solving his problem, though.

Homer:    Oh, what am I going to do?
Moe:      Uh, why don't you invite him over.  Turn him from an enemy to
          a friend.  Then when he's not expecting it -- bam! -- the ol'
          fork in the eye.
Homer:    Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
Moe:      There's always a first time.
-- How to win friends and influence people, "Homer's Enemy"

% Before the big forkless dinner, the family gets some last-minute
% coaching from Homer.  Everyone is asked to be perfect -- Lisa, Marge,
% Bart, and the "other kid."  Marge worries that she'll have enough
% lobsters handy in the event Grimes brings a friend.  There shouldn't
% be a problem, her husband assures, since he made up an excuse to bring
% Grimes to the Simpson house.
%
% The doorbell rings.  Marge calms Homer down, and he answers the door.
% Grimes has arrived right on cue.  His suit is rumpled, and it looks
% like he has put in another weary day on the job.

Homer:    Welcome to the Simpson residence or "casa de Simpson," as I
          call it.
Grimes:   Yeah, what did you want to see me about, Simpson?  This
          better be important.
Homer:    It is, it is, but first, let me introduce you to my family,
          my perfect family.  This is my wife Marge...
Marge:    Hello.
Homer:    ... and our beautiful baby ...
Maggie:   [sucks pacifier]
Homer:    ... my daughter Lisa, I. Q. 156 ...
Lisa:     [curtsies] Hi.
Homer:    See?  And my son Bart; [Bart winks] he owns a factory

          Good Heavens!  This is a palace!  H-How can, how in the world
          can you afford to live in a house like this, Simpson?
Homer:    I dunno.  Don't as me how the economy works.
Grimes:   Yeah, but look at the size of this place!  I -- I live in a
          single room above a bowling alley and below another bowling
          alley.
Homer:    Wow.
Grimes:   [notices some pictures on the wall]  I'm sorry, isn't
          that ...
Homer:    Yes, that's me, and the guy standing next to me is President
          Gerald Ford.
          [gestures to other photos]
          And this is when I was on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins.
          Oh!  And here's a picture of me in outer space.
Grimes:   You?  Went into outer space?  You?
Homer:    Sure.  You've never been?  Would you like to see my Grammy
          award?  [holds up award]
Grimes:   No!  I wouldn't!
          God, I've had to work hard every day of my life, and what do
          I have to show for it?  This briefcase and this haircut!  And
          what do you have to show for your lifetime of sloth and
          ignorance?
Homer:    What?
Grimes:   Everything!  A dream house!  Two cars!  A beautiful wife!  A
          son who owns a factory!  Fancy clothes and [sniffs air]
          lobsters for dinner.  And do you deserve any of it?  No!
Homer:    [gasps] What are you saying?
Grimes:   I'm saying you're what's wrong with America, Simpson.  You
          coast through life, you do as little as possible, and you
          leech off of decent, hardworking people like me.  Heh, if you
          lived in any other country in the world, you'd have starved
          to death long ago.
Bart:     He's got you there, dad.
Grimes:   You're a fraud.  A total fraud.  [leaves]
          [pokes his head in the door]
          [to Marge and the kids] It was nice meeting you.
          [leaves again, slamming the front door]
-- A fork in the eye would have been an improvement, "Homer's Enemy"

% The next day, Bart and Milhouse have a meeting at the factory to
% discuss what to do with some adding machines and industrial waste that
% they found.  "I believe we both know the answer to that," says Bart.
% In case you didn't know the answer:  The boys dump the machines into a
% barrel full of waste, and watch them dissolve.
%
% Later Milhouse mops the floor.  He pauses to wipe his brow, but Bart
% taps on his office window and tells Milhouse to get back to work.
%
% A rickety staircase becomes a fun "wacky shack" when the boys stand
% on top and start rocking it.  Milhouse questions the wisdom of this,
% pointing out signs that say the staircase isn't safe to use.  Bart
% takes the signs down and throws them out the window.  This solves the
% problem to everyone's satisfaction.  Good thing OSHA isn't around.
%
% Marge walks around the front of the house and finds Homer isn't
% having as good a day at =his= job.  In fact, he's still sitting in his
% car, in his driveway.  Marge taps on the window.

Marge:    Homer [knocks again] Homer, why aren't you at work?
Homer:    The car won't start.  I don't feel very good today.  I am at
          work.
Marge:    You're afraid to go to work because Frank Grimes will be
          there, aren't you?
Homer:    That's crazy talk.  You're crazy, Marge.  Get off the road!
          [honks horn]
Marge:    [gets in the car] You have to face him sometime, and when you
          do I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are.
Homer:    No he won't, he hates me.
Marge:    He doesn't hate you.  He just feels insecure because you're
          getting through life so easily, and it's been so difficult
          for him.
Homer:    Yeah, yeah, that's his problem, he's a nut!  It's not about
          me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut.
Marge:    Well ... maybe.  But I bet he would be less crazy if you were
          just a little more, mmm, professional in your work.
Homer:    [gasps]
Marge:    Just a little more.  Then he won't have any reason to resent

Homer:    I'll do it!  [produces a bottle of that wonderful Duff] To

-- "Homer's Enemy"

% Homer's new professional attitude has him eating donuts at the

Carl:     Hey, what do you got against Homer, anyway?
Grimes:   Are you kidding?  Does this whole plant have some disease
          where you can't see that he's an idiot?  Look here.  [points
          out a chart tacked to the bulletin board] Accidents have

Lenny:    Eh, everybody makes mistakes.  That's why they put erasers on
          pencils.
Carl:     Yeah, Homer's okay.  Give him a break.
Grimes:   No!  Homer is not okay.  And I want everyone in this plant to
          realize it.  I would die a happy man if I could prove to you
          that Homer Simpson has the intelligence of a six-year-old.

Homer:    Then, I added some fins to lower wind resistance.  [points to
          a stripe on the cooling tower] And this racing stripe here I
          feel is pretty sharp.
Burns:    Agreed.  First prize.  [gives Homer a blue ribbon, and some
          money]
          [cut to audience shot]
Grimes:   [stands up] What?
Carl:     Way to go, Homer!
Lenny:    You're number one, Homer!
Grimes:   But it, it was contest for children!
Lenny:    Yeah.  And Homer beat their brains out!
          [audience cheers wildly]
-- Now that's sportsmanship, "Homer's Enemy"

% This is the last straw.

Grimes:   Oh, I, I can't stand it any longer.  This whole plant is
          insane.  Insane, I tell you!  [snaps mentally]  Daahh!  Aaah!
          [runs out of the auditorium, and into an equipment room]
          I can be lazy too!  [takes his tie off, and moons one of the
          technicians] Look at me, I am a worthless employee, just like
          Homer Simpson!  Give me a promotion!
          [walks into the break room, and grabs two donuts from the
          box]
          Ooh, I eat like a slob, but nobody minds!  [eats in an
          exaggeratedly slobbish fashion]
          [heads into a bathroom]
          [from bathroom]  I'm peeing on the seat.  Give me a raise!
          [emerges from the bathroom and waves his hands in Homer's
          face] Now I'm returning to work without washing my hands.
          But it doesn't matter, because I'm Homer Simpson!
          [runs to Homer's work station and spins around in the chair]
          I don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it
          for me.  D'oh!  D'oh!  D'oh!  [slaps forehead on each
          "D'oh!"]
Homer:    Hey, you okay, Grimey?
Grimes:   I'm better than okay.  I'm Homer Simpson.
Homer:    [chuckles] You wish.
Grimes:   [notices Burns has walked in]  Oh, hi, Mr. Burns.  I'm the
          worst worker in the world.  Time to go home to my mansion and
          eat my lobster.
          [walks up to some dangerous-looking wires]
          What's this?  [reads sign] "Extremely High Voltage."  Well, I
          don't need safety gloves, because I'm Homer Simp--
          [zap]
-- The untimely demise of, "Homer's Enemy"

% Cut to a shot of Grimes' funeral.  (Looks like he did need safety
% gloves, after all.)  Reverend Lovejoy delivers the eulogy in his
% sonorous manner.

Lovejoy:  Frank Grimes, or "Grimey," as he liked to be called, taught
          us that a man can triumph over adversity.  And even though
          Frank's agonizing struggle through life was tragically cut
          short, I'm sure he's looking down on this right now ...
          [Lovejoy's voice fades as the camera pans to a sleeping
          Homer]
Homer:    [in sleep]  Change the channel, Marge.
          [the mourners laugh]
Lenny:    That's our Homer!
-- Funeral for a friend, "Homer's Enemy"

% As the funeral party laughs at Homer's antics, Grimes' casket is
% lowered slowly into the ground.  Rest in peace, Frank.
