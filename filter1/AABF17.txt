Announcer: And welcome back now to "Cash In your Legacy".  This week we're
           appraising antiques in Springfield.
           [Moe sits at a table with the appraiser]
Appraiser: This gentleman's beer tap dates back to the turn of the century,
           and remarkably, seems to have never been washed.
Moe:       Yeah, yeah, I've been meaning to wash that, but, heh, it's been
           such a century.
Appraiser: At auction, I'd expect this to bring twenty to thirty thousand
           dollars, except that on the handle, somebody's carved "Homer
           rocks".
Homer:     And I do.  Whoo!
Appraiser: Appraised value: $15.
Moe:       I'm gonna kill him!  I'm gonna kill him!  [grabs Skinner's antique
           gun from him, but it disintegrates] Aw, geez.

% Marge comes in the family room.

Marge: I don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day
       like this.  When was the last time we went for a good, old-fashioned
       family walk?
Homer: We stopped those when the kids said I was too fat to carry.
Marge: Oh, come on!  Let's go for a walk.  This family is getting so lazy.
Bart:  I'm not lazy, I'm just ... um ... uh ... Lisa, finish my sentence for
       me.
Lisa:  Why don't you finish your own darn ... [falls asleep and off the couch]
Marge: Fine, if we're not going for a walk, we'll just talk about our day.  I
       wrote another poem about a duck!
-- "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% So, the Simpsons go for a walk down the street.

Homer:  Can't we go home yet?  My feet hurt.  All this fresh air is making my

Barney: [drives by in a car] Get a horse!
Homer:  Can we, Marge?  Can we get a horse?
Marge:  We're walking, Homer.
Homer:  There's some dogs.  We could all ride dogs.
        [some dogs eat from a garbage can]
Marge:  Forget it, Homer.  No one's riding any--
Bart:   [rides by on a dog] Heigh-oh, Silver, away!

% They continue walking.

Marge: Oh, look!  There's the store where I buy my yarn!  ...but you don't

% Marge gives up and follows the crowd to the front of the Fortune Megastore,

Hey, it's not just a store, it's a megastore.  "Mega" means "good", and
"store" means "thing".
-- Homer, "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% The people are finally allowed in the store.  It is filled with many
% departments spanned across three stories.  There are lots of escalators, a

% in front of a camcorder.  The image is projected all across the  megastore.
% Dolph, Nelson, and Jimbo come out of the shoplifting department where they

Costner: Aw, thanks, you're sweet to say that.

Homer:  [tugs at dollar] I don't know. Just give me the dollar.

Brockman: Springfield is still swooning from the whirlwind visit of playful
          plutocrat, Arthur Fortune.
Burns:    Oh, the man has no idea how to behave like a billionaire.  Where's
          the dignity?  Where's the contempt for the common man?
Brockman: This new breed of fun-loving billionaire is a welcome change from

Brockman: ...grasping a glass of brandy with his thin, clawlike fingers...

Burns: I can't believe it.  I'm still not among the hundred most popular

Homer: Well, how about donating money to charity?  Lots of crazy old coots do
       that.
Burns: A charitable donation, eh?  Well, there's a first time for everything.
       [takes out a giant check and fills it out] Take this check for $200,000
       to the Springfield Hospital.
Homer: Can do.  [folds the check many times and puts it in his pants pocket,
