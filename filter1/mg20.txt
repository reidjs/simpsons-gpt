%
% A dark room.
%
% Homer bursts in and turns on the light.  We see that it's Bart's room.
% Bart is asleep.

H: Wake up, everybody!  It's World War Three!!!
B: Waaauuuuuuuuugh!!!!!

% The entire family rush down the hallway (Marge carries Maggie)...

H: Quick!  Down to the fallout shelter!  The bombs are dropping!

% Down the stairs.
%
% And into a room in the basement sealed off with a huge metal door.
% Homer shuts the door behind them, then pulls out a stopwatch.

H:  Eighteen seconds.  Hmm.

% Homer scolds the family by shaking his finger at them.

H: If this were really a nukeeler war we'd all be dead meat by now.

% A shot of the other members of the family, trembling.

H: Say, you're all shivering.  Are you cold, or what?

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:23]
%
% Same as before.

H: Wake up, wake up!  It's World War Three!!

% Homer gets no reaction from Bart, who remains asleep.

H: I mean it this time!  No kidding around!

% Bart angrily gets up.
%
% Once again, the family head down the hallway and down the stairs to the
% fallout shelter.  But this time, they have annoyed expressions.
% (Maggie glares at Homer the entire trip.)  Once again, Homer slams
% the door shut.

H: Ah, here we are.

% He pulls out a stopwatch.

H: Hmm.  Once again your timing's off.

% A shot of the other members of the family, not pleased one bit.
% Everyone (Maggie included) has their arms folded across their chest
% and are gritting their teeth.  (Except Maggie, who glowers while
% sucking on her pacifier.)

H: Yeesh.  What a bunch of grumps.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:52]
%
% If at first you don't succeed...

H: Wake up, wake up!  It's the end of the world!
B: Aw, come on, man!

% Homer shows the stopwatch.

H: I'm timing you.  If we're all fast enough, this will be our last
   nukyooler war drill.
B: If we're quick enough, you'll let us sleep?
H: Let's go-go-go!

% Once more unto the breach.  Down the hall.  Down the stairs.  Into
% the fallout shelter.  (Faster this time.)  Homer checks his stopwatch.

H: All right everybody, back upstairs and into bed!
B: [annoyed] Did we beat the clock?
H: Heh heh.  No, but you were pretty darn close.

% Homer checks his watch.

H: Next drill in three hours.

% A shot of the other members of the family, drowsily angry.  Maggie gives
% a feeble suck on her pacifier.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 1:21]
%
% Trading places.  Bart wakes Homer by shouting through a makeshift megaphone.
% (You can see the cellophane tape.)

B: Wake up, Dad!  It's World War Three!  This is not a test!
H: [waving his arms in panic]  Yaaaaaaaaargh!!!

% Homer rushes down the hall.  Down the stairs.  Into the shelter.
% Homer pulls the door shut.  Marge and Lisa help from the outside.
% Maggie padlocks the door.  Bart leaps into frame, alighting on the
% next-to-bottom step of the stairs.

B: Are you sure this is okay, Mom?
M: [angrily] We'll let him out in the morning.
