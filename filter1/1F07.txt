% At school, Bart and Milhouse play a prank: they paint new dividing
% lines in the parking lot.

    Bart: The beauty of it is, each parking space is a mere one foot
          narrower -- indistinguishable to the naked eye!  But therein
          lies the game.
Milhouse: I fear to watch, yet I cannot turn away.
-- Milhouse, Prince of Denmark, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Watch, he does.  Principal Skinner pulls into an empty spot between
% two cars, parks, and tries to open his door.

Skinner: Blast it, woman!  You parked too close.  Move your car!
   Edna: I'm in the lines!  You got a problem, go tell your Mama.
Skinner: Oh, don't worry: she'll hear about this.

% breathe!" says another.  Bart laughs evilly at the success of his
% prank.

% Eventually, in the grade four class, Mrs. Krabappel lectures them.

Edna: Class, I know there's no way to prove who actually did this, and
      in our American democracy, everyone is innocent until proven
      guilty.
Bart: God bless America.
Edna: But _my_ classroom is not a democracy.  Hah!  For the rest of the

% pulls away, and all the buttons on his shirt pop open, revealing the
% Marge T-shirt.  Suddenly the air is filled with the noise of Marge
% saying "Mmm."  Homer panics and thinks it's a omen, and he runs out,
% but the noise was actually coming from a floor waxer.

Marge: Good news, honey: two weeks are up.  You don't have to wear your
       glasses any more!  And your scalp and posture seem fine.
 Bart: [triumphant] Yes!  [kicks shoes off]
       {[They fly through the air and smash through Flanders' window]}
  Ned: {Kids, did anyone pray for giant shoes?}
  Rod: {I did!}
  Ned: {Okily dokily.}

% At school, Nelson makes a suggestion to his fellow bullies.

We've been doing a lot of upper body work on Bart.  Today, let's pound
his kidneys.
-- Nelson's bullying acumen, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Bart strolls in, humming.  "Let's get -- huh?"  He looks normal!
% "What gives?" asks Jimbo.  "Gentlemen," Bart begins, "the nerd you
% knew is dead.  Beat me and you will be beating one of your own."  The
% bullies pause for a minute, then Nelson says, "Whatever," and they
% beat him anyway.

% The "Welcome National Energy Convention" sign flashes briefly, but
% then burns out.  {The camera pans past all the exhibits at the energy
% convention inside the convention center: cold fusion, "Oil Power",
% "What About Wind?", coal, and water.  It comes to rest on the solar
% energy display ("Cheap, clean hope for tomorrow"), which is being run
% by Hans Moleman.  A man in a suit with sunglasses asks, "So this stuff
% really works?"  "It certainly does," says Hans proudly.  "Oh, well,
% lotsa luck!" says the man, giving Hans a chop in the neck.  A number
% of other men in suits appear, and two of them close red curtains
% around the exhibit.  When they open them again, one man sits behind
% the desk in front of a banner that says, "Fossil Fuel: Use Us and
% Nobody Gets Hurt."}

% Homer and Mindy sit at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant booth.
% Behind them, the booth's display proudly advertises, "As Seen on 60
% Minutes".  Mindy files her nails.

Man 1: Thanks for poisoning the planet, bastard!
Mindy: Get bent!
Man 2: No more Chernobyl!
Homer: Go to hell!
-- Homer and Mindy run the Nuclear Energy display, "The Last Temptation
    of Homer"

% Homer tosses a brick at him (which he had ready, as though he was
% expecting trouble), and chuckles.

Homer: You know, I was a little worried about coming to this convention
       with you.  But I think as long as we're not alone together --
  Man: [over loudspeaker] And now, the moment you've been waiting for.
       This years King and Queen of Energy are Homer Simpson and Mindy
       Simmons!
Homer: Huh?
        [Everyone applauds as the two are given crowns]
  Man: Homer, Mindy, you've just won a romantic dinner alone at Madam
       Chao's, the sexiest Chinese restaurant in Capital City.
Homer: Is there any way to get out of this?
  Man: [stern] No!
-- Accolades fit for a resume', "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Homer and Mindy finish their sexy dinner at Madam Chao's.

Mindy: [sighs] What a perfect evening.  It sure was nice of them to make
       us cheeseburgers.
Homer: Uh, yeah.
-- At a Chinese restaurant, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Homer opens his fortune cookie and reads his fortune.

Homer: [reading his fortune] "You will find happiness with a new love."
       [out loud] Aw, even the Chinese are against me.  [sigh] What's
       the point?  I can't fight fate.
        [In the kitchen...]
Man 1: Hey, we're out of these "New Love" cookies.
Man 2: Well, open up the "Stick With Your Wife" barrel.
-- Controversial fortune cookies, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Back at their hotel...

Homer: [unhappy] Well, I guess you'll want to come in.
Mindy: [bright] OK.
Homer: [mocking] "OK!"
        [They sit on the bed]
Mindy: This was a really nice night, Homer.
Homer: Yeah, yeah.
-- Homer, appreciative date, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% He begins sobbing.

Mindy: What's wrong?
Homer: Oh, yeah, like you don't know.  [weeping] We're gonna have sex!
Mindy: Oh...well, we don't have to.
Homer: [sad] Yes we do!  The cookie told me so.
Mindy: Well...desserts aren't always right.
Homer: But they're so sweet!
-- Homer and Mindy alone in the hotel, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Mindy tries to reassure him.

Mindy: Homer...you don't have to do anything you don't want to.
Homer: Well, maybe I want to...but then I think about Marge and the
       kids...well, not the boy: he drives me nuts.  Sometimes I'd just
       like to --

% Mindy says that Homer knows how she feels, and she tells him it's up
% to him.  "Look in your heart; I think you'll see what you want."
% Their heads move slowly closer as though they're about to kiss
% passionately, but instead they kiss briefly.  Homer makes up his mind
% and soon he is drooling over shapely, female flesh as Barry Whites
% "Can't Get Enough of Your Love" plays in the background.

Homer: Oh, baby.
Marge: This was a _wonderful_ idea, Homey.  [kisses him] Hey, there's a
       turkey behind the bed!
Homer: Mmm, Marge.
Marge: [laughs girlishly, turns out the light]
Homer: [sings]
       Oh Margie, you came and you found me a turkey
       On my vacation away from worky...
-- Homer, incurable romantic, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% In the dark, another pair of eyes appear.  The owner of the eyes wolf-
% whistles, makes a cat noise, imitates a bed squeaking, purrs, pants,
% barks, howls, twiddles his lips, and says, "Hubba, hubba!"  Homer
% punches him in one eye.
