% On a sunny day at the SNPP at 8 am, Mr. Burns strolls gleefully into

Smithers: Good morning, sir.  Care for some coffee?
   Burns: [joyful] No, the promise of a new day is more than enough

% A sip is all that's needed to boost his batteries.

   Burns: We need some excitement around here!
Smithers: Chinese checkers or domestic, sir?
   Burns: No, no.  Something _fun_.  Something the men will enjoy...
          like a safety drill!  But what kind?
-- That sounds like a lot of fun indeed, "Mountain of Madness"

Burns: Meltdown alert?  Mad dog drill?  Blimp attack?  Ah... I think a
       good old-fashioned fire drill today.
        [alarm goes off; most people just stare, intrigued]
 Carl: All right, popcorn's ready!
        [takes the bag out of the microwave and pours kernels in a bowl]
Homer: Hey... that's the fire alarm.
 Carl: We gotta get out of here.
Lenny: Wait for me!  [filling a cup at the cocoa machine]  Come on, come
       on, come on!

%
% Mr. Burns and Smithers stand outside the plant, waiting for Burns'
% victims to evacuate.

   Burns: Is it supposed to take this long?  What's a good time for a
          mass evacuation of the entire plant?
Smithers: Forty five seconds.
   Burns: And what's our time so far?
Smithers: I don't know, sir.  This stopwatch only goes up to fifteen
          minutes.
   Burns: Damnation!  What kind of slow coaches do I have working for
          me?
           [Homer runs out the door]

% Homer shuts the door and secures it with a bench, before he runs,

Burns: Yes.  [hauntingly]  You won, all right.  You won more than you
       bargained for.
Homer: Woo-hoo!
-- "Mountain of Madness"

% Mr. Burns scolds his employees (who finally made an escape, albeit

% fistfight, proving his point.  The crowd cheers the fight, but Mr.
% Burns shows disappointment.
%
% At the dinnertable, Homer explains the day's events.

     Homer: So, Mr. Burns is gonna make us all go on a stupid corporate
            retreat up in the mountains to learn about _teamwork_.
            Which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around
            here.
      Bart: Teamwork is overrated.
     Homer: Huh?
      Bart: Think about it.  I mean, what _team_ was Babe Ruth on?  Who
            knows.
Lisa+Marge: Yankees.
      Bart: Sharing is a bunch of bull, too.  And helping others.  And
            what's all this crap I've been hearing about tolerance?
     Homer: Hmm.  Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to

% Nevertheless, the family will have to attend to the retreat.
%
% At a snow-covered Mt. Useful, the family tries to park the
% stationwagon, but it only succeeds in slipping around on the ice,
% bumping into cars. Homer finally decides to park it somewhere in the
% proximity of their intended parking space.
%
% Mr. Burns hosts the event, preparing his employess for what will be

% supposed to do.  At any rate, since it's too late to take them back,
% they'll have to stay there.  The kids moan.

 Marge: Don't worry, kids.  This is a national park.  We can have lots
        of fun!
Ranger: Oh, I'm afraid that's no longer true, ma'am.  Budget cutbacks
        have forced us to eliminate anything the least bit entertaining.
         [long pause]
        Well, uh, see ya.
-- And that's just a sample, "Mountain of Madness"

Smithers: Each two-man team will work its way through the wilderness to
          a cabin hidden somewhere on this mountain.  The routes are

   Homer: [raising hand] Uhh, I lost my map.
Smithers: You haven't been issued a map, yet.
-- Better safe than sorry, "Mountain of Madness"

Smithers: When you arrive at the cabin, there will be a congratulatory
          party with sandwiches and moderately-priced champagne.
           [the crowd applauds]
   Burns: Now, as an added incentive, the second-to-last team to arrive
          at the cabin will receive an hilarious "world's first employee
          trophy."
   Homer: Hey, this sounds like fun!
   Burns: And the last team to arrive will be fired.
   Homer: [chuckles]  [realizing] Uh-oh.
-- "Mountain of Madness"

And to show that I'm not playing favorites, both Smithers and I will be
participating. Who knows?  _I_ might be the unlucky one who gets fired.
[sotto voce] Not bloody likely.

% Team after team, the employees are paired off.  Fong and Zutroy.
% Kimball and Dawson.  Haney and Drucker.  Simpson and... Burns?!  Homer
% moans, but then realizes he's on the one possible team that can't be
% fired.

Smithers: Sir, this can't be right.  You assured me this drawing was
          rigged so we'd be teammates.
   Burns: Yes, well, frankly, you've been a bit of a pill lately.
Smithers: Why do we always fight on vacation?
-- Perhaps the boathouse was indeed the time, "Mountain of Madness"

Well, there's only one name left.  Whoever it is will be paired with me.
And that person is -- Waylon Smithers.  Perfect.  That's just perfect.

% Mr. Burns prepares the pairs for the starting point.  Upon shooting

% Smithers, meanwhile, is hiking up the snowy mountain, alone, cursing

Smithers: How could you do this to me, Mr. Burns?  After all I've done

Burns: Tell me, Simpson.  If an opportunity arose for taking a small
       shortcut, you wouldn't be adverse to taking it, would you?
Homer: Uhh, not as such.
Burns: Neither would I.  I've always felt that there's far too much
       hysteria these days about so-called cheating.
Homer: Yes, a lot of -- hysteria. [worried look]
Burns: Mm-hmm.  If you can take advantage of a situation in some way,
       it's your duty as an American to do it.  Why should the race
       always be to the swift or the jumble to the quick-witted?  Should
       they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them?
       Well, I say cheating is the gift man gives himself!
Homer: Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat.
Burns: Excellent.
