% We watch the conclusion of a McBain movie, and Grampa and Jasper boo and
% hiss when it ends.

Grampa:  The screen was too small.
Jasper:  The floor was sticky.
Grampa:  The romantic subplot felt tacked-on.
Jasper:  In short, we demand a refund.
-- Complaining at the movie theater, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% The clerk tells Grampa, ``Don't have a heart attack, old dude.''
% And Grampa does.  Meanwhile, it is dinnertime at the Simpson residence.

... and thank you most of all for nuclear power,
which has yet to cause a single proven fatality.
At least in this country.  Amen.
-- Homer, saying grace, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% When Bart sneaks a bite of a green bean during the blessing, he and Lisa
% get into an argument...

Quiet you kids.  If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch cartoons,
and Lisa doesn't get to go to college.
-- Homer, threatening his kids, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% So Bart and Lisa resort to `pantomomime' to communicate.  The dinner is
% interrupted by a phone call from the hospital.  Grampa had a mild heart
% attack.

Grampa: Pull your chair closer, my son.
Homer:  What is it, Dad?
Grampa: Peeyoo!  Not that close!  Sheesh.
        Homer, that heart attack made me realize that I'm going to die
        someday.
Homer:  Oh, Dad, you and your imagination.

% Grampa tells Homer something he ought to know:  He has a half-brother.

% the skirts...

Hey handsome, wanna `dunk' the `clown'?
-- Carnival girl/prostitute, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

She did things your mother would never do.  Like have sex for money.
-- Grampa, remembering an affair, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% When the carnival returned to town a year later, the carnival girl had
% a surprise for him... a baby boy.  The baby was left at the Shelbyville
% orphanage.  When Granma gave birth to Homer...

Granma: Abe, I want Homer to grow up respecting his father.
        He must never know about that, that carnival incident.
Grampa: Okay.
Granma: Promise you won't tell him.
Grampa: I promise.
        [end of flashback]
Grampa: Oops!  Forget what I just told you.
-- hospital visit, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

Homer:  This makes me special, Dad.  Since I'm the one you kept, that

Grampa: Mm.  Interesting theory.

% In the car on the way home...

Lisa:   A long-lost half-brother.  How Dickensian!
Bart:   So, any idea where this bastard lives?
Homer:  Bart!
Bart:   His parents aren't married are they?
        It's the correct word, isn't it?
Homer:  I guess he's got us there.
Marge:  Mmm...

% Inside...

Director:  I know how you feel, Mr. Simpson.
           I myself have spent years searching for <my> long-lost twin brother.
Homer:     Yeah yeah yeah.  Well, I wish I could help you, but we're looking
           for <my> brother today.
-- visit to the orphanage, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

Director:  Your brother could be anywhere.  Even ... Detroit.
Homer:     I know he could be <anywhere>,
           that's why I want you to narrow it down!  Please!
Director:  You know, Mr. Simpson, if you ask me, the city of <brotherly> love
           isn't Philadelphia, it's ... Detroit.
Homer:     Well, if you asked me, changing the subject makes you the
           most worthess, heartless excuse for a human being I ever...
Director:  Read between the lines, Mr. Simpson!
Homer:     Oh, I get it!  Okay.  Here's twenty bucks.  Now will you
           tell me where my brother lives?

-- Homer, looking through the phone book, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% Homer calls all three `Powell, Herbert's in the phone book, with no luck.
% Marge suggests trying to call `H Powell', and he hits the jackpot.

Homer:   Hello?  Hello?  Stupid phone!  [bangs the phone]
Herbert: Hey, knock it off.  I'm here!
         I'm just silent because of the emotion involved.
Homer:   Oh.  Sorry.

Bart+Lisa:  Are we there yet?
Homer:      Just a little further!!
Marge:      Bart!  Lisa!  If you don't behave, we'll turn this car
            right around and go home.
Homer:      But Marge, I want to see my brother!
Marge:      Oh, for God sakes, Homer, it's an empty threat.

% spills his drink (D'oh!).  Meanwhile, at Powell Motors...

Herbert:  Every day we're losing ground to the Japanese and I want to know why.
Advisor:  Oh, unfair trade practices?
Advisor:  Mushy-headed one-worlders in Washington?
Advisor:  Some sort of gypsy curse?
-- board meeting, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads!
-- Herbert Powell, board meeting, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

Herbert: You, what are your roots?
Advisor: Well, I guess you could say they extend to when the Angles met
         the Saxons... [all except Herbert chuckle]
Herbert: Or in other words, when white met bread.

% Homer arrives at the Powell mansion, and Herbert steps out of his limo.

Herbert:  All born in wedlock?
Homer:    [whispers] Yeah, though the boy was a close call.
-- introducing his family, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% Bart identifies himself as `the little hell-raiser', and Homer tosses
% Maggie into Herbert's arms.  (Maggie instinctively grabs Herbert's tie.)

Herbert:  While you're here, I want you to make yourselves right at home.
          Any time you're hungry, any time day or night,
          Cook will make you anything you want.
Homer:    Even pork chops?
Herbert:  Absolutely.  We have a tennis court, a swimming pool,
          a screening room...
Homer:    If I want pork chops any time in the middle of the night,
          your guy will fry them up?
Herbert:  Sure, that's what he's paid for.

% the engineers shoo Homer away.  Homer returns home...

Herbert:  Hey Homer, how's your car coming?
Homer:    Oh, fine.  They were putting in an onboard something-or-other

-- first day on the job, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

Herbert:  Do you understand?
Homer:    Sort of.
Herbert:  Homer?
Homer:    What.
Herbert:  Answer me again with self-confidence!
Homer:    SORT OF!
-- pep talk, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% Homer goes back to his team of engineers and tells them what he wants.
% Like a place to put his drink.  Not a little cup, but one of those
% super-slurpers at the Kwik-E-Mart.  And all sorts of other amazingly
% tacky things...

Some things are so snazzy they never go out of style!
Like tail fins... And bubble domes... And shag carpeting...
-- Homer, designing a car, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% While Lisa and Bart are playing croquet, Herbert gets a call from his
% lead engineer.

Hang up, call me back, and say the exact opposite of everything you just said.
-- Herbert, to his advisor, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% He then calls Lisa and Bart over and lets them listen to the engineer's
% `modified' report.  Homer continues to throw his weight around the lab...

I want a horn here, here, and here.
You can never find a horn when you're mad.
And they should all play `La Cucaracha'.
-- Homer, designing a car, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

Advisor: What about a separate soundproof bubble-dome for the kids
         with optional restraints and muzzles?
Homer:   Bullseye!

To think I wasted my life in boardrooms, and stockholders meetings,
when I could've been watching cartoons!
-- Herbert Powell, watching `Itchy and Scratchy'

Hello there.  Do you miss the Antarctic?
-- Lisa, talking to a penguin at the zoo, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% When Homer is shown the plans for his car, he tears it up and draws
% his own.  The moment has come for the grand unveiling...

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed stockholders,
members of the press, Your Holiness...
-- Herbert Powell, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

All my life, I have searched for a car that feels a certain way.
Powerful like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding like a Nerf ball.
Now, at last, I have found it.
-- Homer, describing his car, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% When Herbert learns the monstrosity costs $82,000, Herbert realizes he's
% doomed.  Homer gives the horn a honk, and it plays `La Cucaracha'.
% Herbert's bags are packed as a crane replaces the `Powell Motors' sign
% with `Kumatsu Motors'.

Homer:   Gee Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all
         your possessions.  I can't help but think that maybe you'd have been
         better off if I'd never come into your life.
Herbert: Maybe I would have been better off?
         MAYBE!
         Why you sponge-head.  Of COURSE I'd have been better off.
         As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother!
Marge:   Mm.  Maybe he just said that to make conversation.
-- Herbert leaving forever, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

His life was an unbridled success until he found out... he was a Simpson.
-- Lisa, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

% Grampa arrives, then says, ``D'oh! I knew you'd blow it!''  On the ride
