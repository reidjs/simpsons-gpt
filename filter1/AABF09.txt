Announcer:     The start of television's second most exciting season --

Homer:         Door?

Homer:         Perfect.

Archie:        Aw, jeez, they got me livin' with an African-American, a
               Semite-American, and a woman American there, and I'm
               glad, I loves youse all!  I love everybody!  I wish I'd

Homer:    Oh, I can't wait.  Look, Marge, I got a scorecard printed up
          at that all-night scorecard place.
Lisa:     Isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows
          that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?
Homer:    You're thinking of all the other years.  This year's shows
          are classic.  There's "The Laughter Family" -- that's
          animated.  Networks like animation 'cause they don't have to

% Homer, much to his amazement (and ours), thinks the show is a bit

% One of the criminals stirs from his resting place in the middle of

% bullet between his fingers and tosses it back at him.  The bullet

% commands, as if that were necessary.  As the camera drifts away from
% the scene, the message "Blood Provided By American Red Cross -- Give
% Blood Today!" pops up on the screen.

Homer:    Wow.  They captured my personality perfectly!  Did you see
          the way Daddy caught that bullet?
Lisa:     That's not really you, Dad, he's just a fictional character
          who happens to have the same name.
Homer:    [long pause] Don't confuse Daddy, Lisa.
Marge:    Homer, it's just a coincidence.  Like that guy named Anthony

% Later that night, the phone rings while Homer and Marge lay in bed.

% At "By The Numbers Productions", Homer walks into a building painted

Homer:         Uh ... so, I just wanna know how come you made your

Producer #1:   Stupid?  [laughs] Well, I can assure you, it happened

Homer:         It better have!
Producer #1:   The thirteen of us began with a singular vision --

Producer #2:   But then we found out that ABC had a similar project in

Homer:         Who's Jeremy Piven?
Producer #3:   We don't know.
Producer #4:   But it scared the hell out of us, so we slapped together

Homer:         Police Cops.
Producer #5:   Uh, no, actually, it was called "Badge Patrol".
Producer #1:   But the network idiots didn't want a show about high-

Producer #2:   So we asked ourselves, "Who's behind the badge?"
Producer #3:   Police ...
Producer #4:   Cops ...
Producer #5:   "Police Cops."
Homer:         Yeah, but why does the Homer Simpson character have to

          is fabulous ...
Homer:    Anyway, Marge, how do you feel about the economy?
          [Lorne walks away dejectedly]
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Later, Homer smokes a cigar with some other guests, sharing stories.

Homer:    So I said, "If this is the House of Pancakes, how come I
          can't eat the walls?
Trent:    Oh, you are too much, Max.
Guest:    I thought I knew all the players in Springfield.  Where have
          you been hiding yourself?
Homer:    Well, I spent a lot of time on the couch.
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Elsewhere, Marge dances with President Clinton.

Clinton:  I know you don't think you're good enough for me.  But
          believe me, you are.  Hell, I done it with pigs.  [laughs]
          Real, no-foolin' pigs!
Marge:    Are you sure it's a federal law that I have to dance with
          you?
Clinton:  You know, I'd change that law if I could, Marge.  But, I
          can't.
Aide:     [whispers in Clintons' ear]
Clinton:  Aw, shoot.  Quebec's got the bomb!  Well, I gotta go, but ...
          look, if you're ever near the White House, there's a tool
          shed out back.  I'm in there most of the day.
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Trent taps his glass with a spoon and steps on a chair.

Trent:    Attention, please, attention.  Um, I just wanna say how
          thrilled I am with this turnout.  I'm proud to share my home
          with Springfield's best and brightest.
Homer:    [eating a raw fish] Hey, no problem.
Trent:    We've all been blessed with privilege and success.
Homer:    Whoo!  Privilege!  [twirls fish in the air]
Trent:    Uh ... but with privilege comes grave responsibility.
Homer:    [spitting out fish] What?
Trent:    We all have to give something back to the world that's been
          so good to us.
Homer:    Give something back?  Boo!  Get a haircut!
Trent:    I'm talking, of course, about our endangered forests.  [crowd
          members talk with each other in agreement] We have to protect
          them, because trees can't protect themselves, except, of
          course, the Mexican Fighting Trees.
Homer:    Could somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up?
Trent:    Can we let the wanton destruction of our nation's forests
          continue?
Crowd:    No!
Trent:    If a tree falls in the forest, will you make a sound?
Crowd:    Yes!
Trent:    To the protest bus!
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Marge and Homer, not really enthusiastic about getting on the bus,
% are pushed on by the crowd of Springfield elite.  Trent, not sensing
% their reluctance, tells them they're going on a trip to save a stand of
% redwoods.  Homer screams and pulls on an Emergency Exit handle.  Marge
% shouts out the window at Ed Begley, Jr.

Marge:    Aren't you coming, Ed?
Begley:   I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth.  It's a go-
          cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.
          [Begley attaches a wired-helmet to his head and quickly
          drives off]
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Later, Homer, Marge, and the rest of the party-goers have themselves
% chained to trees.

Homer:    Oh, this is the worst party ever!
Marge:    I don't know.  Remember that New Year's Eve at Lenny's?  He
          didn't even have a clock.
Homer:    Oh, Marge, I thought it would be fun to be on Springfield's
          "A" list.  But these people are nuts!
Marge:    You can't blame them for having a social conscience.
Homer:    Sure you can.  Bunch of no-good do-gooders.
Begley:   Hang in there, Max.  Saving the environment is a hard,
          grueling job.
Homer:    That's what I'm saying!  See Marge, this guy gets it.
-- At least somebody there does, "Homer to the Max"

% Chief Wiggum pulls his car up next to the redwoods, alongside a few
% idle bulldozers and their operators.

Wiggum:   All right, what's going on here?
Begley:   We can't allow you to destroy these beautiful trees, which
          have the same rights you have!
Wiggum:   Man, I have really had it with you tree-huggers.
Homer:    [laughs] Tree-huggers!
Wiggum:   Something funny, nature boy?
Homer:    No.  I just thought it was cute when you called him ...
Wiggum:   All right, "Max Power".  Eddie!  Swab this joker's eyes with
          mace.
Marge:    Swab?  I thought it was a spray?
Wiggum:   Okay, she's second!
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Eddie dips a long cotton swab into a jar of Hippie-Strength Mace and
% brings it toward Homer's eyes.  Trent tells Homer not to give Wiggum
% the satisfaction of screaming.  Homer doesn't even plan on giving
% Wiggum the satisfaction of being swabbed with mace, however.  He starts
% running circles around the tree, trying to escape.  Eddie chases him.
% Providing backup, Lou joins in the chase, but runs directly behind
% Eddie in the same direction.

Lou:      Eh, you better call for back-up, Chief.
Homer:    Just leave me alone!  Go swab Begley!  He likes it!
Eddie:    Slow down, punk!
-- "Homer to the Max"

% While running around the tree so many times, the chain around Homer's
% waist has dug into the flesh of the tree so far it falls.  As it goes,
% it takes other trees out like dominoes.  Yelling "I'm free!", Homer
% tosses his chain into the air, knocking a bald eagle out of the air.
% As trees begin falling, crushing what's left of the entire forest, one
% falls on Wiggum's police car, which was just two days away from
% retirement.
%
% When the dust clears, there's nothing left of the forest except for
% some logs on the ground and Springfield's elite crawling out of the
% ruins.  As Trent surveys the damage, Homer sheepishly asks where the
% party bus is headed next.  He is met with angry glares.
%
% Sometime later, Homer lies in bed with Marge.

Marge:    Well, I'm glad you changed your name back to Homer Simpson.
Homer:    Yes, I learned you gotta be yourself.  Good night, honey.
Marge:    Good night.
          [Homer flips off the lamp, but then flips it back on]
Homer:    Oh, I almost forgot.  While I was at the courthouse I had
          them change your name.
Marge:    To what?
Homer:    Chesty La Rue.
Marge:    Chesty La Rue?!
Homer:    Just try it for two weeks!  If you're not completely
          satisfied, you can be Busty St. Claire.
Marge:    I don't want to be Chesty La Rue, or Busty St. Claire!
Homer:    Fine, Hootie McBoob it is.
Marge:    Good night, Homer.
          [Marge reaches over and turns off the lamp]
Homer:    Sleep tight, Hootie.
Marge:    Let go of those!
