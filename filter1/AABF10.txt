% At Springfield Elementary, students and their parents enjoy "That's
% Edu-Tainment," a faculty talent show, which opens with teachers
% singing to the tune of, "Fame."  Well, perhaps "enjoyed" is too strong
% a word ...

I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks and
blows.
-- Bart Simpson, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Principal Skinner comes down from a human pyramid (upending the man
% he was supporting in the process) to introduce the first act of the
% night.

Skinner:  Whew.  Mercy.  Good evening.  Our old friend Noah Webster
          defines "laughter" as, "the act or sound of laughing."  [a
          shoe thrown from the audience strikes Skinner on the head]
Nelson:   [from audience] Ha-ha!
Skinner:  [chuckles] Well illustrated, Nelson.  And now, fasten your
          funny bone for Groundskeeper, oh, or should I say Grinskeeper
          [reads card] No, sorry, Groundskeeper was correct ... Willie!
Willie:   [playing bagpipe walks on stage as Skinner leaves]
          How many of you hail from the fair city of Edinburgh?
          [dead silence from hall]
          So, have you noticed how North Edinburgh golfers putt like
          this [putts stiffly] and South Edinburgh golfers putt like
          this?  [putts with knees bent]
          Eh?  [bagpipe deflates] Eh?  Oh, I see -- Willie's not funny
          unless he's down on his knees, scooping up your little brats'
          puke!
          [audience laughs]  Thank you, you've been great!
-- Live at SES, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Next up is Edna Krabappel, who wears nothing but balloons and sings
% "Fever."  Every so often she pops one of the balloons, revealing more
% and more of what's underneath.  The members audience shudder
% collectively.
%
% Skinner and Chalmers try their luck being Abbott and Costello.

Chalmers:   Well, Seymour, it seems we've put together a baseball team,
            and I was wondering, who's on first, eh?
Skinner:    Not the pronoun, but rather a player with the unlikely name
            of "Who" is on first.
Chalmers:   Well that's just great, Seymour.  We've been out here six
            seconds and you've already managed to blow the routine.
            [storms off, muttering]  Sexless freak.
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Mercifully, Skinner calls an intermission when the show reaches its
% halfway point.  He touts the upcoming act -- cafeteria workers doing a
% Beatles impersonation -- which quickly clears the auditorium.
% Desperate to get away, everyone gets in their cars, including the
% Simpsons.

Homer:    [nudges Marge to the steering wheel] You drive, I eat.
          [chows down on some boxes of snack food]
Lisa:     Dad, you're supposed to pay for those snacks.
Homer:    I saw Krabapple's butt -- I paid.
          [Marge drives towards the exit, which needless to say is
          mobbed]
Marge:    Whoopsie.  This could take a minute.
Lisa:     There's an opening, mom.  [points]
Marge:    I don't know, I hate to change lanes once I get going.
          That's really for race car drivers.
          [Ned Flanders, from his car, motions Marge to go ahead]
Bart:     Mom, to your left, he's letting you in.  Go!
Lisa:     Come on, mom.
Homer:    Gun it, woman.
Marge:    No, no, as soon as I get over, that lane will stop moving.
          Erma Bombeck said so, and Dave Barry agrees.
          [a line of cars sneaks in ahead of Marge]
Homer:    Aw, you suck, Marge.
          [Krusty, driving his Canyonero, pulls up behind the Simpsons,
          and leans on his horn]
Krusty:   Come on, move it you clowns!
Marge:    What in blazes?
          [Krusty decides to cut across school grounds, even driving
          over a fence]
Krusty:   So long, schlubs!
Homer:    [admiring] Wow, did you see that thing?  So powerful, so
          demanding, so forceful and raw.  It didn't ask, it just took.
-- It's so ... manly, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Smitten with the Canyonero bug, Homer visits his friendly dealer,
% where he literally drools over the new trucks.  Gil approaches him.

Gil:      Go ahead, drool all you want, you can't hurt that finish.
          Now rainwater, that will strip it right off, so ... aw, I
          shouldn't have said that ... aw, Gil.
Homer:    Hey, a red one.  [runs to a red Canyonero]  Can I buy that?
          Please?
Gil:      Well, if you, well ... really?  Wow, Hot, hot dog!  A sale!
          [goes to put a little Canyonero marker, indicating a sale, on
          a bulletin board]
Stan:     I'll take it from here, Gil.  [takes Gil's marker]
Gil:      No, wait, no.  Aw, you can't take my sale.  My wife's going
          to leave me if I don't start bringing in the green.  Come on,
          let me have this one, Stan, I'm begging you.  Look at me, I'm
          begging you, Stan.
Stan:     Mm-hm.  [walks Homer to his office]  Let's go write this up,
          shall we?
Gil:      [pulls a rotary-dial cell phone from his jacket, and dials]
          Honey, you should have seen me with my last customer, I ...
          no, but I came so close.  This guy was as ... Whose voice is
          that?  Is that Fred? ... Aw, you said it was over ... No,
          don't put him on -- Hello, Fred, h-hi.
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Meanwhile, in his office, Stan puts the finishing touches on the
% deal.  In addition to the truck itself, Homer buys a slew of finish-
% protecting treatments, along with a tent to protect the paint.  The
% dealer also outlines the financing which includes a CBP, or "crippling
% balloon payment."
%
% Soon Homer is showing off his Canyonero at the SNPP.  As he drives
% past, Lenny and Carl make cat-calls from the parking lot.  Homer stops
% and lowers his window.

Lenny:    Oh, sorry Homer.  We thought you were one of those hot-to-
          trot soccer moms.
Carl:     Yeah, you don't see many men driving the F-series.  [Lenny
          and Carl indicate badge on side of truck]
Homer:    Huh?
Lenny:    [reaches in the window, and pulls something out]  See,
          instead of a cigarette lighter, it's got a lipstick holder.
Homer:    Aw, crap, it's a girls' car!  I can't drive this.
Lenny:    Oh sure you can, dollface.  [makes kissy noises]
Carl:     Heh, heh, pretty thing like you can do whatever she wants.
          [Lenny and Carl share a laugh]
Homer:    Shut up!  Screw you guys!  [drives off]
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Homer won't suffer the indignity of being seen in the F-series, so he
% opts for something a little more masculine -- Marge's station wagon.
% When Marge won't give him the keys, he pretends to walk to his
% Canyonero, only reach under the hood of Marge's car at the last
% second.  He hot-wires it, jumps in, and roars off.
%
% Marge still has to do her grocery shopping, and the Canyonero is the
% only vehicle available.  She walks up to the enormous truck, and eyes
% it suspiciously.

Marge:         Good Lord.  How am I supposed to get in this beast?
               [opens the door.  A mechanized stepladder unfolds from
               the doorsill]  Hmm.  Well, that's a nice feature.  [gets

               Not much headroom, though.  [the sunroof opens, allowing
               her hair to spring out]  Ooh!  Well, I guess I can drive
               it for a little while.
               [the patter of little feet is heard, and then the kids
               jump into the back seat]
Lisa:          But mom, I read that sport-utility vehicles are more
               likely to be in fatal accidents.
Bart:          Fatal to the people in the other car.  Let's roll.
Marge:         Hang on, the manual says I need to log on to the onboard
               computer.  [enters "MARGE" on a keypad]  M-A-R-G-E.
Computer:      Hello, Marge.  Where would you like to go today.
Marge:         No one has ever asked me that before in my life.

% On the way home from the grocery store, Marge marvels at the
% Canyonero's ability to haul a prodigious amount of food.
% Unfortunately, gridlock has stranded Marge and the groceries on the
% highway.  Even though the house is in sight, they can't get to it.
% Bart occupies his time constructively, if you consider tormenting his
% sister with whipped cream to be constructive.
%
% Bart does a little back-seat driving.

Bart:     C'mon, Mom, just cut across the field.
Marge:    Oh, I don't know.  Doesn't seem right.
Bart:     Do you want to spend your whole life doing what's right?
Marge:    Of course not.  [sees the "4X4" button blinking enticingly]

-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% With the Canyonero jingle playing in the background, Marge engages
% the four-wheel drive, signals her turn, and cuts across the field,
% scattering wildlife left and right.  "You the man, Mom," Bart says,

% tries to get Marge in to settle the matter, but she's preoccupied with
% washing her truck.
%
% Meanwhile, Homer's snacking routine is disrupted by a rare find -- a
% three-chambered peanut.  He calls for her to come see what "he" did,
% but she doesn't respond.  Homer goes looking for her, and finds her in
% the driveway, attaching some auxiliary lights to the Canyonero.

Homer:    Marge, you've been out there all morning.
Marge:    So?
Homer:    So?  Lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if
          you aren't around to see it.
Marge:    Oh, I'll come watch you do nothing after I try out my new
          high-intensity halogen headlights.
          [turns on the headlights.  The beams are strong enough to
          pierce the kitchen wall, allowing us to see that Lisa has
          Bart in a headlock.  Startled by the light, she runs off.
          Marge chuckles]
          Nobody will ever cut me off again.
Homer:    Aw, please come in.  Maggie smells bad and the cat wants

Sgt. Crew:     In, these modern hectic days of fast food, answering

% The startled lemur runs around its cage, and bites a kangaroo on the
% tail.  The panicked kangaroo jumps over the fence into the rhino
% compound, hitting a rhino.  It runs toward the rest of the heard,
% starting a stampede.  The startled rhinos trample down the gate and
% escape into the zoo.

% Marge jumps out of the truck.  It rolls over and catches on fire.
% The rhino diverts from his course to stomp out the flames.

Marge:    [raps on the door of the Porta-John] It's okay, Homey.  You
          can come out now.
Homer:    [from inside] Uh, give me a minute.
          [his hand reaches out to grab some toilet paper, and takes it
          inside]
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% The police and the zookeeper arrive to throw a net over the escaped
% rhino.

Homer:         Oh Marge, you saved me!
Bart:          Wow, you are so much cooler than Milhouse's mom!
Wiggum:        Yeah, way to channel that rage, Simpson.
Lisa:          How'd you know your plan would work, Mom?
Marge:         Glad you asked, honey.  Well, I was watching "Dateline,"
               and Stone Phillips said SUVs always roll over when you
               turn sharply.  And the gas tanks explode at the drop of
               a hat.
Zookeeper:     And she also knew that if a rhino sees a flame, he'll
               instinctively try to put it out.
Marge:         Stone Phillips again.
Homer:         Is there anything that guy doesn't know?
Zookeeper:     Boy, that Stone Phillips sounds like quite a bloke.
               What television network is he on?
Bart:          Why, NBC, of course.
Lisa:          NBC has lots of great shows, and their news and sports
               coverage can't be beat.
Wiggum:        Do you think there's anything great on NBC right now?
Homer:         Oh, I'm sure of it.
Marge:         But there's only one way to find out.
               [cut to the closing credits]
Homer:         [voice-over]  I'd like to read the following statement,
               but I do so under ... [sound of gun cocking] ... my own
               free will.  It has come to my attention that NBC sucks.
               I apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as
               many Fox shows as possible.  So in summary, NBC -- bad.
               Fox -- good.  [sotto voce] CBS great.
               [sound of gunshot, followed by a thud.  The Gracie
               Studios logo appears, accompanied by three gunshots]
-- Don't touch that dial!  "Screaming Yellow Honkers"
