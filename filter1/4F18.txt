%
% "Itchy & Scratchy in:  Deaf Comedy Blam"
%
% Itchy, dressed as a doctor, walks into the hospital's ear trauma
% ward.  Scratchy is a patient there, strapped to a bed.  Itchy slaps
% his stethoscope on the cat, and pulls the sensor part of the
% instrument down the stairs, and out the front door of the hospital.
% He hops into a cab, and goes to the airport, where he catches a plane
% for the South Seas.  Landing on an Island where the French are
% conducting nuclear weapon tests, Itchy points the sensor towards the
% blast site.  Boom!  The sound pulse from the explosion travels down
% the stethoscope's sound tube like a mouse down a python.  It travels
% under the sea, past a Hollywood weasel chatting on his cell phone,
% over hill and dale, until it reaches Scratchy in the hospital.  The
% sound literally goes to Scratchy's head, which swells to several times
% its normal size, and then pops like a balloon.  A dog in the next bed
% shushes Scratchy's headless body.  The End.

% Bart and Lisa laugh themselves silly at this (who wouldn't?), which
% wakes up Marge.

% Mr. Sparkle.  Homer takes time out to greet them in their own language
% ("Konnichiwa").
%
% Suddenly, Ned screams again.  The family quickly pinpoints the sound
% as coming from Baboon County, which is the zoo's name for the baboon
% pit.  They rush up to the rail and, sure enough, there's Ned,
% surrounded by a troop of angry baboons.

Flanders:  Help, what do I do?
Lisa:      Play dead!
Homer:     No!  Run around in circles!
Bart:      No, act like a lion!
Marge:     Swipe at the dominant male!  Come on, Ned, knock that monkey
           down!
-- Sure could use the Listen Lady at a time like this, "In Marge We
   Trust"

% The zookeeper comes by, and is astonished to find that there's a man
% in the baboon area.

Marge:     You've got to get him out of there.
Zookeeper: Jeez, I'd like to, but if they don't kill the intruder,
           it's really bad for their society.
Bart:      They're going to kill him?
Zookeeper: Eventually.  First, they'll eat his skin.
           [the family gasps in horror]
Homer:     Ew.
-- Stuff they don't show on "National Geographic" specials, "In Marge
   We Trust"

% Flanders is trapped in a tire swing set up for the baboons.  One of
% the animals tries to sever the rope with a rock.  Flanders yells out
% his last requests -- a fancy funeral with a big coffin and lots of
% jewels.  As the baboons close in, a train whistle sounds.  Reverend
% Lovejoy has commandeered a kiddie train that runs along a mountain in
% the baboon pit.  He reaches down and grabs Ned just as the tire drops
% into the crowd below, and hauls him into the train.  But they're not
% out of the woods yet.  Two baboons jump onto the train.

"Say your prayers, you heathen baboon!"
-- Reverend Lovejoy, "In Marge We Trust"

% Lovejoy grabs a tree branch and swings around like a gymnast, using
% his momentum to kick the two baboons back into their yard.  A third
% baboon leaps onto the train.  Lovejoy uncouples the cars, and he and
% Flanders ride to safety while remainder of the train stays with the
% baboons.

Bart:     Wow.
Lisa:     Oh, those poor monkeys.
Marge:    They started it.
-- Putting the blame where it belongs, "In Marge We Trust"

% Ned expresses his gratitude for Lovejoy's bold rescue.

Flanders:  You saved me, Reverend.  You really went above and beyond.
           Thank you.
Lovejoy:   Oh, don't thank me, thank Marge Simpson.  She taught me that
           there's more to being a minister than not caring about
           people.
Flanders:  [chuckles] Amen.
-- Yeah, there's also beating up monkeys, "In Marge We Trust"

% As the two men talk, the train heads back to Baboon County.  The
% cries of the baboons suggests they know who's coming ...
%
% ... but it looks like Lovejoy will live to fight another day.  For
% now, he has the Sunday church crowd enthralled with retelling of the
% rescue of Ned Flanders.

Lovejoy:  Baboons to the left of me.  Baboons to the right.  The
          speeding locomotive tore through a sea of inhuman fangs.  A
          pair of the great apes rose up at me but -- bam, bam! -- I
          sent them flying like two hairy footballs.  A third came
          screaming at me ... [imitates hissing baboon]
          [quietly resolved] ... and that's when I got mad.
Homer:    Now, that's religion.
-- Amen, "In Marge We Trust"
