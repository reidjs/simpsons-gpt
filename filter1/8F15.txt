Bart: Hey, I don't need you to get me in the back of a police car.

Lisa:  Well, <I'm> going to be a famous jazz musician.  I've got it all
       figured out.  I'll be unappreciated in my own country, but my
       gutsy blues stylings will electrify the French.  I'll avoid the
       horrors of drug abuse, but I do plan to have several torrid love

%
% Homer answers the door.  It's the two cops.  Homer nervously tries to
% explain, ``I didn't steal that copper wire, I just thought they were

Bart:  Wow!  Can I see your club?
Cop:   It's called a baton, son.

Bart: Do you need straight A's to be a cop?
The Two Cops:  [laugh uproariously]
-- Just checking, ``Separate Vocations''

% ``Would you cover us?''  The two cops tiptoe along, and the bad guy's

% The next morning, Lisa comes down to breakfast, grousing.  ``Morning,
% Honey!'' greets Marge.  ``What's so good about it, stuck in the house
% by the stove...'' mutters Lisa.  Marge tells Lisa that homemaking leaves
% opportunity for creativity.  Marge shows Lisa how she arranged the bacon,

% asks, ``What's the point?  They'll never notice.''  Marge responds,

% Marge slaved over.  (The sound of Homer eating here is hilarious.)
%
% Bart practices fingerprinting Maggie, who then crawls away, leaving
