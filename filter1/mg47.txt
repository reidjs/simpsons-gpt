% The family stand outside the door of Dr. B. F. Sherwood.  Marge holds
% some knitting.  Lisa holds a chain of paper dolls in one hand, a pair
% of scissors in the other.  Bart holds a toy machine gun.

B: Family therapy?  What the hell is this?
L: You said we were going out for frosty chocolate milkshakes.
H: Well, I lied.

% The door opens.

S: Uh... Simpsons?  Welcome.

% The family enter the office and are seated.

S: So what brings you to family therapy?
H: Well, Doc, it's like this.
   They're all driving me crazy.
B: [interrupting]         He's always blaming things on me.  It's not my fault.
L: [interrupting]         There's always something wrong with me.  I wish I
                          was an orphan.
H: Lisa!

% Bart spots the bowl of mints on the doctor's desk.

B: Oh, boy!  Mints!
S: Go ahead.  Take one.

% Bart starts shoveling them in.

H: We never laugh anymore, Doc.
L: You can say that again.

% Bart pauses his mint-fest briefly.

B: [mouth full] When Homer's right, he's right.

% Bart then resumes his shoveling.

L: For once the old man's correct-a-rooni.
H: Shut up!
S: I'm sensing some deep-seated hostility here.  Why don't we all take a
   deep, cleansing breath.

% Everyone takes a deep breath and exhales.  Bart then resumes eating mints.

S: Don't you think you've had enough mints, son?
B: I ain't leavin' 'til that bowl's empty.
H: Put those mints back, boy.

% Bart spits out liquefied mint-goop back into the bowl.

L: Ewwwww!
S: Good Lord, you little slob!  You ruined the whole bowl!
L: Don't talk to my brother like that, you big oaf!

% Lisa kicks the doctor in the shin.

S: 'Oh!  [rubbing his leg] Why you little borderline psychotic...!

% Homer rises from his seat.

H: No one talks to my daughter like that!
S: Oh, yeah?  Now are you gonna bully me like you bully your kids?
B: We don't like you, sir.

% Bart raises his toy machine gun and rapid-fires rubber suction darts
% at the doctor.  Lisa cuts the doctor's tie.  Marge gasps.

S: [trying to remain calm]  Leave this office, please.

% The doctor pries a suction dart off his face.  (It leaves a red mark
% behind.)
%
% The family walk out of the office into the hallway, the door slamming
% shut behind them.  They exchange embarrassed glances, then their mouths
% start to quiver, and they all burst out laughing (including Maggie).
