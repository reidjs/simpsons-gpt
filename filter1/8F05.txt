% Krusty flashes back to his youth.

Man 1:   Should I finish college?
Rabbi K: Yes.  No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge.
Woman:   [babe in arms]  Rabbi, should I have another child?
Rabbi K: Yes.  Another child would be a blessing on your house.
Man 2:   Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler?
Rabbi K: Eh, couldn't you rephrase that as a, as an ethical question?
Man 2:   Um...  Is it right to buy a Chrysler?
Rabbi K: Oh, yes!  [chuckles]  For great is the car with power steering
         and dynaflow suspension!

Rabbi K: You know that my son Herschel was first in his yeshiva class?
         As a matter of fact, he was voted `The most likely to hear God'.
Rabbi 2: Oh, go on, Hyman, you're exaggerating again, you're so proud of
         your son.
Rabbi K: A rabbi would never exaggerate!  A rabbi composes.  He creates
         thoughts.  He tells stories that may never have happened.
         But he does not exaggerate!

% But when a ``rowdy rabbi'' sprays Krusty with seltzer, his clown make-up
