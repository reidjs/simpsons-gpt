 Marge: [Holding bottle] Maggie, can you say ba-ba?  Can you say mama?
  Bart: Can you say get bent?
 Marge: Bart!
  Bart: Mister Rogers says it all the time!
 Marge: He does not.
 Homer: Maggie, can you say daddy?  Daddy?
 Marge: Kitty.  Kitty.

-- Too much chicken for Liz, "Lisa's First Word"

        Marge: Oh Maggie, when are you going to talk?
         Lisa: Well, don't push her.  Remember, it is better to remain
               silent and be thought a fool than open your mouth and
               remove all doubt.
Homer's brain: What does that mean?  Better say something or they'll
               think you're stupid.
        Homer: Takes one to know one.
Homer's brain: Swish!
-- Homer, non sequitur master, "Lisa's First Word"

Marge: According to Fretful Mother Magazine, if Maggie doesn't talk at

    Marge: The story of Lisa's first word is very cute.
Bart+Lisa: Tell it, Mom!  Tell it, Mom!  Tell it!
    Homer: Yeah.  Tell it, Mom!

% Marge begins, "This story begins in the unforgettable spring of 1983.

% Bzzzt.  She's awaiting another baby.  Homer's keys are flushed down

% possibilities.
%
% Marge is becoming as big as a house, so they talk about their future.

Marge: I'm afraid we're going to need a bigger house.
Homer: No, we won't.  I've got it all figured out.  The baby can have

Marge: Won't that warp him?
Homer: My cousin Frank did it.
Marge: You don't have a cousin Frank.
Homer: He became Francine back in '76.  Then he joined that cult.  I

%
% Homer and Marge visit Stinking Fish Realty.  But they have problems

% is too violent.  The second house is located next to a rendering
% plant.  ("Mmm...hog fat").  {The third one is Captain McAllister's
% houseboat, where the good Captain's sales pitch is interrupted while

Homer: Dad, I have a problem.
  Abe: Why did you come to me?  I don't know nothin'.  I used to get by

% Not yet, Abe's not.  He continues until Homer interrupts him.

 Homer: I need $15,000 to buy a home.
Grampa: Oh, well.  All I own is this house that I built with my own two
        hands.
 Homer: You didn't build this house.  You won it on a crooked 50's game
