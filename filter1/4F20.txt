% Troy McClure walks down the pristine hallways of a museum, his shoes
% squeaking on the tile floor.  On the walls are large posters
% commemorating various television shows.  McClure stops at one of these
% -- "Fish" -- and then turns to face the camera.

McClure:  "Spinoff!"  Is there any word more thrilling to the human
          soul?  Hi, I'm Troy McClure.  [begins walking] You may
          remember me from such TV spinoffs as "Son of Sanford and Son"
          and "AfterMannix."
          [he hits a dead end, and does an about face]
          I'm here at the Museum of TV and Television with a real treat
          for "Simpsons" fans (if any) because tonight we present, "The
          Simpsons Spinoff Showcase!"
-- Troy McClure kicks off ... "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% And with those words, the title "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" spins
% onto our screen.  The audience cheers wildly as the credits for
% creator and executive producer play.
%
% [End of special introduction.  Time:  0:34]
%
% Back at the museum, Troy explains that the folks at the network
% approached the "Simpsons" team with a simple request.

McClure:  Thirty-five new shows to fill a few holes in their
          programming lineup.
          [presents a schedule chart that's actually more holes than
          lineup]
          That's a pretty daunting task -- and the producers weren't up
          to it.  Instead, they churned out three "Simpsons" spinoffs,
          transplanting already popular characters into new locales and
          situations.  First up, a gritty crime drama starring
          Springfield's beloved Police Chief Wiggum.  Keep at least one
          eye open because his best friends, the Simpsons, just might
          pop in to wish him luck.  Let's us wish him luck too.  Good
          luck, Wiggum! [salutes]

% McClure picks up a solid gold remote control from a hand-shaped
% stand, and uses it to turn on a giant-screen TV, just in time to see
% the opening credits for...
%
%                    "Chief Wiggum, P. I."
%
% Wiggum roars into town in a snazzy red convertible.  He's driving
% quickly, perhaps be cause he has an appointment to shoot out the
% windows of Tipitina's bar.  Then it's a brief rooftop chase, with
% Wiggum jumping a gap between two buildings (on a motorcycle, no less).
% Finally, he does battle with a feisty crawfish.  Skinner, introduced
% as "Skinny Boy", chats up an informant.  Wiggum's son Ralph has some
% fun adding a "G" to the "Wiggum, P. I." sign on his dad's door.
%
% As the show itself starts, Wiggum and Skinner lug boxes of detective
% material into Skinner's new office.

Ah, New Orleans.  The Big Easy.  Sweet Lady Gumbo.  Old ... Swampy
-- Chief Wiggum, settling into his new town, "The Simpsons Spinoff
   Showcase"

% The first order of business for New Orleans' new gumshoes is
% explaining how the two men came to be there in the first place.
% Wiggum, we learn, was kicked out of Springfield's police department
% for massive corruption.  Skinner reminisces about his childhood in the
% city.  His stint as Springfield Elementary's principal was just a
% temporary dalliance; he has always been a small-time hustler at heart.
% It is this quality that led Wiggum to hire Skinner as his leg man.
%
% Their conversation is rudely interrupted when someone throws a skull
% through the window.  Being the master detectives that they are, the
% two men deduce it isn't the welcome wagon.

Skinner:  Looks like you got an enemy, Chief.  You know, folks here
          don't much care for law and order types.
Wiggum:   [picks the skull up with a pencil]  Is that right?  Maybe
          they'll change their minds once I arrest them for throwing
          skulls all over my floor.  [puts the skull on his desk, dumps
          two fistfuls of pencils in the eye sockets, and leans back to
          admire his decorating skills]
-- "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% That night, aboard his houseboat, Wiggum tucks his son into bed.

Wiggum:   Oh, man, what a day.  It's no cakewalk being a single parent,
          juggling a career and family like so many juggling balls ...
          two I suppose.
Ralph:    Daddy, these rubber pants are hot.
Wiggum:   You wear 'em until you learn, son. [kisses him goodnight]
-- "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% The next day, Wiggum and Skinner plot their next move at a Bourbon
% Street eatery.  Chef Paul Prudhomme scoots by the two men on his
% motorized cart and delivers a plate of crawfish.

Prudhomme: I guar-an-tee!
Skinner:   Will you stop saying that!
Wiggum:    So Skinner, who do you figure threw that skull through my
           window.  What's the word on the streets?
Skinner:   Well, to be honest Chief, I haven't lived in New Orleans
           for forty-two years.  Although according to an article I
           read in "Parade" magazine ...
Wiggum:    Uh-huh.
Skinner:   ... a criminal by the name of "Big Daddy" runs this town.
Wiggum:    "Big Daddy," eh?  Well, he won't feel so big if he messes
           with Chief Wiggum, P. I. again.  Which I sincerely doubt he
           will.
-- Doubting Clancy, "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% Alas, Big Daddy doesn't give up so easily.  While Wiggum sleeps, a
% mysterious figure slips an alligator through his window.  The gator
% begins to nibble on Wiggum's head.  Understandably alarmed, Wiggum
% bolts out of bed and fires about ten shots.  They all miss, but the
% commotion draws Skinner onto the scene, and he wrestles the alligator
% into submission.

Skinner:  Lucky for you this is just a warning gator.  Next one won't
          be corked.  [points to the corks blunting the alligator's
          teeth]
Wiggum:   [shouting into the night]  Listen up, Big Daddy!  You don't
          scare me!  I'm three steps ahead of you!
Skinner:  Oh, Chief?  Your boy has been kidnapped.
Wiggum:   Oh, God!
-- So far ahead, he's behind, "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% Ralph's bed is indeed empty, except for yet another skull.

Skinner:  Big Daddy's trademark calling card -- it's right here inside
          the skull.
Wiggum:   [shakes the card out of the skull] Looks like we got our
          first case ever, Skinny Boy.  And this time, it's personal.
-- "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% Cut to an establishing shot of New Orleans.

"Chief Wiggum, P. I." will return -- right now!
-- Announcer, "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% And back to our show.  The phone rings in Wiggum's office.

Wiggum:    [picking up the phone]  Who is this?
Skinner:   It's me, chief.  I'm on the other extension.
Big Daddy: Now you listen up mon ami, and you listen good, hear?  The
           name's Daddy, Charles Daddy.
Wiggum:    Big Daddy!  What have you done with my boy, Daddy?
Big Daddy: Ah, the boy is fine -- so far.  I taught him to play the
           spoons.
           [Ralph blissfully tries to play the spoons with his nose]
           If you ever want to see that boy again, I suggest you leave
           town today, hear?  [hangs up]
Wiggum:    [hangs up]  Sounds like there was some kind of party going
           on in the background.  Are there any parties today,
           Skinner.?
Skinner:   Eh.  Not really a party town.  Though if I remember
           correctly they occasionally a function called Marty's ...
           something.
-- "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% They go over to the window and open the shutters, revealing the
% famous Marty's Something parade.  Wiggum runs down to the street,
% where he is confronted by revelers wearing outsized party masks.
% Laughing, the partygoers put off their masks, showing themselves to be
% our favorite family.

Wiggum:    If it isn't my old friends from Springfield, the Simpsons!
           What brings you folks to New Orleans?
Bart:      Mardi Gras, man.  When the Big Easy calls, you gotta accept
           the charges.
Lisa:      Chief Wiggum, I can't wait to hear about all the exciting,
           sexy adventures you're sure to have against this colorful
           backdrop.
Wiggum:    Well golly, I'd love to chat but my son's been kidnapped.
           You haven't seen him, have you.  Caucasian male, between
           the ages of six and ten, thinning hair.
Homer:     Over there.  [points to the crowd, where Big Daddy and
           Ralph are]
Ralph:     Look, Big Daddy, it's regular daddy.
Big Daddy: The Chief!  Ooh, I suppose I'd best to run.  [fans himself
           with his hat]  Lord have mercy, how I wish I weren't so
           fat.
-- The Simpsons make a guest appearance, "The Simpsons Spinoff
   Showcase"

% Big Daddy tucks Ralph under his arm, and a foot chase ensues.  Wiggum
% pursues Daddy through the streets of New Orleans, then the graveyards
% of New Orleans, and finally to the boat docks of New Orleans.  Daddy
% steps onto his airboat [basically, a flat-bottom boat powered by a
% large propeller mounted on the rear] and takes off down the river.
% Wiggum commandeers another airboat ("Police business," he shouts as he
% kicks the owner overboard).  He and Skinner chase after Big Daddy.
% Big Daddy's boat driver unsheathes a knife and tries to jump onto
% Wiggum's airboat, but Wiggum literally blows him away with the
% propeller.
%
% The chase ends at an imposing mansion on stilts in the middle of the
% river.

Wiggum:   [whistles]  What do you suppose the rent is on a hideout like
          that?
Skinner:  Ahh, it's not rented, Chief -- it's stolen.  That's the
          Louisiana Governor's mansion; it's been missing for eight
          months.
-- That explains why the Governor has been living in the Astrodome,
   "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% Big Daddy runs to his office, sits down, and turns his back to the
% door -- just so he can spin around dramatically to face his pursuers.

Wiggum:    You!
Big Daddy: Welcome to my maison, Chief.  I've been expecting you.
Wiggum:    Is that so, Big Daddy?  Well expect this:  [draws gun] The
           arrest of you, by me.
Big Daddy: New Orleans is my town.  Nobody going to mess with me.  I
           got interests, and I ain't talking about stamp collecting,
           though I do find that extremely interesting.
Skinner:   Oh yeah?  That makes two of us.
Big Daddy: You know, boys, there's an old saying down on the bayou
           that, uh, blah! [throws Ralph at Wiggum and Skinner]
-- They're mighty eloquent down on the bayou, "The Simpsons Spinoff
   Showcase"

% Big Daddy jumps out the window, and swims for it.  Slowly.

Skinner:  He's gradually getting away, Chief.
Wiggum:   Ah, let him go.  I have the feeling we'll meet again, each
          and every week.  Always in more sexy and exciting ways.
Ralph:    Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be just like you.
Skinner:  Better start eating, kid.
Wiggum:   Start eating!  [laughs]
Ralph:    I didn't mean it that way.  [laughs]

          maintained its popularity without Moe the bartender?  Let's
          hope so, because Moe's leaving to do his own sitcom.  But

% tends bar for his only customer that night, Barney.

Barney:   [finishing up his beer]  Well, I gotta go.  I got a date with

Moe:      She told me she was washing her hair tonight.  [sighs]  I'm

Grampa:   [voice only] Ah, quit your bellyaching, you big loser.
Moe:      Who, who said that?
Grampa:   I did!  It's me, Abe Simpson.
Moe:      But you're d-d-d-dead.

Grampa:   Don't be afraid, Moe.  I'm here to help you with your

Betty:    What?
Moe:      "Go near Moe."  I'd say that's a pretty strong endorsement.

Moe:      You did it, Grampa!  You really are a love expert.
Grampa:   Dang right.  Fact is, I invented kissing.  It was during

          Hooooour!
-- "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% The stage floor spits into three segments.  The children ride the
% left and right parts offstage.  Homer and Marge stand on the center
% piece, which rolls toward the audience.  Marge tells us that the
% family has been "busy as beavers" getting the show ready.  Homer asks
% Marge if she wonders what it would be like if the family really were
% beavers.  Of course, Marge says yes, because who among us hasn't
% wondered this?
%
% The conversation also leads to a skit, which is set inside a beaver
% dam.  To the audience's delight, Homer strolls in, clad head to toe in
% a beaver costume.

Homer:    Honey, I'm home!
Marge:    Hello, dear.  How was work at the plant?
Homer:    It's not a plant, Marge, it's a tree, and I've nearly chewed
          through it.  Now remember, my new boss is coming home for
          dinner tonight.
Marge:    I know, and I made your favorite -- stakes!
          [gestures toward a big plate of fence stakes.  The audience
          (the one on TV, but probably the one at home, too) groans]
Bart:     Hey, could you two close the dam door?
Marge:    Bart!
Bart:     But that's where we live.  A _dam_.
Marge:    [grumbles]
"Lisa":   [walks in] Look everybody, Maggie got her first tooth.
          [holds up Maggie, in a baby-beaver costume, complete with
          buck tooth.  The audience laughs, then goes, "awwww"]
Homer:    Now, before my boss comes, there's something important you
          should know.
          [doorbell rings]
Marge:    In a minute, Homey, I have to get the door.  [goes to greet
          the visitor]
Homer:    But, Marge!
          [not heeding, Marge opens the door.  Tim Conway stands at the
          entrance, dressed as a skunk.  The family faints]
Conway:   Oh, was it something I said?
-- "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% Some brief "Laugh-In" style clips bridge the gap to the next big
% number.  Capt. McAllister feels "someone should be keelhauled" for the
% last sketch.  Judge Snyder orders it stricken from the record, and
% calls in the next sketch.
%
% The next sketch opens with the family dressed in 1950s gear, sitting
% in a 50s soda shop.

Marge:     Inflation, trade deficits, horrible war atrocities ... how
           are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many
           problems in the world?
Homer:     Well, I know one thing in this world that's still pure and
           good.
Marge:     Christian love?
Homer:     No.  Candy!  [climbs on table]  Sweet, sweet, candy!
           [the orchestra strikes up the "I Want Candy" tune]
Homer:     [singing] I want candy!
Marge:     But don't you want to end world famine?
Bart:      [hops out of the booth] I want candy!
Marge:     Or save the endangered Alaskan salmon?
"Lisa":    I want candy!
Marge:     Well if you won't think of society's ills ...
H + B + L: [singing] I want candy!
Marge:     At least, think of our dentist bills.
           [happy dentists show up, bearing bills]
-- They probably want candy, too, "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% The song segues into, "The Peppermint Twist"  Bart, "Lisa," and
% Maggie each stand on a giant peppermint candy (the round disk kind,
% not the stick type) and do the twist -- the peppermint twist.
%
% The camera cuts to Jasper, dressed in a turn-of-the-century boys'
% outfit.  He does, "The Lollipop Song," but when he gets to the finger-
% popping part, he manages to launch his dentures a short distance.
% Waylon Smithers, dressed as a cowboy, performs a butt-wiggling
% rendition of Devo's "Whip It," and tops it off by using his whip to
% snap a bubble that Selma is blowing.  The Simpsons revisit "I Want
% Candy" with a big dancing finale, joined by dancers wearing candy
% costumes.  After they finish, they smile and pant heavily from
% exhaustion.
%
% Quick cut to Hans Moleman, holding a flower.

Moleman:  A poem, by Hans Moleman.
          I think that I shall never see,
          My cataracts are blinding me.  [flower wilts]
Conway:   [still in skunk costume]  And they thought I stunk.
-- Hans' Poetry Corner, "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% For the show's finale, the Simpsons address the studio audience from
% an enormous bed.

Marge:        Well, it's time to say goodnight.
Homer:        I wish our special guest Tim Conway didn't have to leave
              so soon.
Conway:       [pops up from under the covers]  I'm still here.  Fox
              wouldn't spring for a decent hotel room.
Marge:        [laughs]  He's just kidding.  We'd like to thank Fox and
              the good people at Budget Lodge.
Homer:        Well, that's all the time we have.  So this is the
              Simpson family saying, as you walk down that road of life
              ...
Bart:         [interrupting]  Hitchhike -- it's faster.
All but Bart: Ba-a-r-rt!
Bart:         [laughs]
Marge:        We're like this all the time!
All:          Goodnight, everybody!

% A big pillow fight breaks out, with everyone joining in, except Tim
% Conway (who is apparently a conscientious objector).
%
% Troy McClure shuts off the television.

McClure:   That's it for our spinoff showcase.  But what about the
           show that started it all?  How do you keep "The Simpsons"
           fresh and funny after eight long years?  Well, here's
           what's on tap for season nine.
           [McClure pushes a button on the remote, and we see a still
           shot of Homer turning Lisa into a frog]
           [mock-spooky]  Magic powers!
           [McClure cycles through three pictures of Selma marrying
           Apu, the Bee Guy, and Itchy]
           Wedding after wedding after wedding.
           [McClure pushes the button again, and we see Bart
           confronting two thinly disguised variations of himself]
           And did someone say, "long-lost triplets?"
           [cut to a shot of the Simpsons] So join America's favorite
           TV family, [an alien appears, floating above the family]
           and a tiny green space alien named Ozmodiar that only Homer
           can see, on Fox this fall.  It'll be out of this world!
           Right, Ozmodiar?
Ozmodiar:  Damn straight, Troy my man!
Troy + Oz: Goodnight, America!
