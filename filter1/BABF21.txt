% It's time for America's favorite TV family, "The Munsters!" 
% Oops, no, wait, it's really the Simpsons, appearing as the
% Munsters to introduce the eleventh Treehouse of Horror.  One
% by one, they step out the door of their imposing mansion on
% 1313 Mockingbird Lane:  Homer as Herman Munster, Marge as wife
% Lillian, Bart as Eddie, Lisa as Marilyn (holding a book of
% copyright law), and Abe as Grampa.  They walk off screen, only
% to rush back by the door, scared.  A mob of townspeople has
% shown up at the gate, and they don't look too welcoming.  The
% mob descends upon the family, sending them to their gruesome
% demise.  Only Lisa is spared, and she walks away from the
% carnage, whistling and trying her best to look nonchalant.
%
% Welcome to ... Treehouse of Horror XI.
%
% Our first tale is, "G-G-Ghost D-D-Dad."  The family is eating
% breakfast, as Homer searches in vain for a comic strip to
% read.  He settles for the daily horoscope.

Homer:	Oooh, my horoscope.  [reading] "Taurus:	Today you 
	will die."
Marge:	What?!!
Homer:	[continuing] "... and you may get a compliment from 
	an attractive co-worker!"  Lenny?
Lisa:	[takes paper] It really says die?  That's unusually 
	specific for a horoscope.
Marge:	[takes paper] Mmm. Maybe I better check mine.  
	[reads] "Today your husband will die."
Homer:	Oooh, scary newspaper. [takes the paper, and waves 
	it mockingly] Don't hurt me horoscope.  I'm afraid 
	... Ow!  Paper cut! Paper cut!
-- I said *don't* hurt me, "Treehouse of Horror XI"

% Homer leaves for work.  As he backs out of the driveway,
% lightning strikes a tree, which just barely misses striking
% the front of the car.  "Missed me!" Homer taunts.  He drives
% past a work zone where men are demolishing a Planet Hollywood
% restaurant.  The wrecking ball knocks down the planet above
% restaurant which falls on and destroys most of the car. 
% "Stupid horoscope," Homer says to himself, chuckling.  Then a
% pick-axe comes through front windshield and imbeds itself in
% Homer's forehead.  Homer laughs and says, "Flupid bloroplope."
%
% At the plant, Lenny compliments Homer on the rattlesnake
% biting his harm.  Carl is concerned about the snake's deadly
% venom, but Homer assures him the snake will give up after an
% hour or so.
%
% Back at home ...

Homer:		That horoscope was baloney. Nothing happened 
		except the pickaxe in my head, the rattlesnake 
		bite, and the testicle thing.  What's for 
		desert?
Marge:		No desert until you eat your broccoli.  [Homer 
		takes some broccoli, chokes on it and dies]
		[cut to a shot of Dr. Hibbert examining 
		Homer's body]
Hibbert:	Mm.  Another broccoli-related death.
Marge:		I thought broccoli was ...
Hibbert:	Oh, yes. one of the deadliest plants on earth.  
		Why, it tries to warn you itself with its 
		terrible taste.

% Meanwhile, medical attendants place Homer in a body bag

Attendant:	Sure is easy when they're stiff like this.
		[notices Bart and Lisa are watching)
		[sympathetic] ... and very sad.
-- Bedside manner, "Treehouse of Horror XI"

% Homer rises to the gates of Heaven.

Homer:		Saint Peter! Woo  hoo!  Got to heaven before 
		you, Flanders!  [wiggles his butt at the earth 
		below]  Ha-ha-haha-ha!
St. Peter:	I wouldn't celebrate so soon, Mr. Simpson.  I 
		don't see a single good deed next to your 
		name.
Homer:		Well the thing about that is ... [attempts to 
		break into the pearly gates]
St. Peter:	Homer, settle down.  I'll give you a chance to 
		get into heaven.  You have 24 hours to go back 
		and do one good deed.
Homer:		I'm sorry, I didn't get the number of hours or 
		good deeds.
-- Mission impossible, "Treehouse of Horror XI"

% St. Peter opens a trapdoor in a cloud and Homer falls back to
% his home.

Marge:		Oh, Homie, I still can't believe a piece of 
		broccoli killed you!
Homer:		[Homer picks up the broccoli and looks at it]  
		What the hell was I thinking?  [pops it into 
		his mouth and chokes to death again]
		[a ghost rises from his prostrate ghost and 
		rises to Heaven again]
		[to St. Peter, sheepishly] I tried the 
		broccoli again.
St. Peter:	[sighs]..You have 23 hours left.  [opens the 
		trapdoor again]
-- Kill me once, shame on you, kill me twice ... "Treehouse of

% Homer floats above Marge's bed, speaking in a ghostly voice.

Homer:	Marge ... Simpson!
Marge:	Homer! It's you! I thought I'd never see you again!
Homer:	You were wrong ... dead wrong!
Marge:	Do you have to talk like that?
Homer:	[reverts to his normal voice] No, not really.  
	Marge, you have to help me.  I have to do one good 
	deed to get into heaven.
Marge:	Well I have a whole list of chores.  Clean the 
	garage, paint the house, grout the ...
Homer:	Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm just trying to get in.  I'm 
	not running for Jesus.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XI"

% But a good deed is easier said than done.  Homer flies above
% the streets of Springfield, looking for the opportunity to
% make a difference.  He spots Agnes Skinner trying to cross a
% busy intersection, and figures this is his chance.  He soon
% has competition from a troop of Boy Scouts, so he swoops down
% and tries to carry Agnes across the street.  She isn't a
% willing passenger.  Mrs. Skinner accidentally slips through
% Homer's grasp and falls to her death in the intersection 
% below.  Homer tries to put the best spin on it, saying "I'm
% pretty sure she was going to be the next Hitler!"  Perhaps so,
% but this incident does not improve Homer's good-deed
% statistics.
%
% Cut to Homer leaving the Kwik-E-Mart, sucking on a Squishee. 
% It falls right through his ghostly "body," and people slip on
% the Squishee puddles Homer leaves behind.

Homer:	Let's see....good deed.  Got to find a good deed.  
	[we see Nelson giving Bart a noogie in an alley]
Homer:	Bingo!
Nelson:	[sing-song] Your dad is dead, mine's just in jail.

	Homer, and starts giving him a noogie]
	Bart! Help!  [Bart shrugs and walks away]

% Homer sits dejectedly at the town square.

Homer:		Just one minute left to get into heaven.  
		There's got to be some good deed I can do.  
		Come on , think!  Think!
Woman:		My baby!
		[we see a carriage rolling down the steps of 
		town hall towards the street, to certain doom]
Homer:		[to baby] Stop that crying.  Man, you're 
		annoying.  [picks up the baby from the passing 
		carriage just to quiet him down.  The carriage 
		bounds down the remaining steps, and across 
		the street before it bursts into flame]
Woman:		Oh!  It's a miracle!  Thank heavens!
Homer:		Woo-hoo!
Homer:		Did you see that, I did the deed, open up!  
		[Homer rises up to heaven]
St. Peter:	Oh, I'm so sorry. I wasn't looking.
Homer:		Hey, I thought you guys could see everything!
St. Peter:	No, you're thinking of Santa Claus.
Homer:		Well I'll be damned.
St. Peter:	I'm afraid so, yes.

	pain!
Homer:	Oh no!

% The second story of the evening is, "Scary Tales Can Come
% True."
%
% This tale opens on the edge of a great forest.  We see a
% drawing of a pumpkin-shaped cottage, which fades into the
% "real" version.  This is the home of the Simpsons, a peasant
% family.  Marge chides Bart for watching the fireplace, because
% she thinks the fire is too violent.  Bart pays her no mind,
% and encourages Lisa to drop some "stupid book" she's reading,
% and join him.  She decides to stick with her copy of "Grimms'
% Fairy Tales" for now.
%
% Homer comes home from work.

Homer:	Hello wife!  Hello children!  Who's up for a merry 
	jig?  Do-de-doo-doo, Do-de-doo-doo,  [falls down] 
	Oh, who am I kidding?  I'm not merry.  I lost my job 
	as an oaf today.
Marge:	What?! _Why_ are the oafs always the first to go?
Bart:	Maybe you could be a dunce, father.
Homer:	Really? [tears page from Lisa's book]
Lisa:	Hey!!
Homer:	[takes page from book and makes a dunce cap] What do 
	you think? Do you love it?
	[he leans over, and his hat catches fire from a 
	candle on wall.  Homer screams and puts his hat out]
Homer:	Oh, I'm no dunce. I was born and oaf and I'll die an 
	oaf.
Marge:	But husband, without the weekly pittance, how shall 
	we feed our children.
Homer:	Don't worry.  No child will ever starve in my home.
	[cut to Homer tossing Bart and Lisa into the Deep 
	Dark Woods]
Homer:	So long, kids!  Enjoy your new home!  Say "hi" to 
	your other brother and sister.
Bart:	Other brother and sister?

	and Lisa sitting at foot of tree]

  Bart:	AHHHHHHHH!
Lisa:	Face it.  They're not great parents.

% Walking through the woods, the kids come to a log bridge. 
% Bart is about to cross it, but Lisa pulls him back.  "That
% bridge has a troll under it," she warns.  Sure enough, a Moe-
% like troll tries to grab them, but misses.
%
% Fortunately, Lisa has recognized that all the stories in her
% book were inspired by the very forest around them.  She
% figures the book can keep them out of danger.  As the kids
% leave the dangerous bridge behind them, the lonely troll sighs
% sadly, figuring that he has come on "too strong" once again.
%
% Bart and Lisa approach a cottage in the forest and use the
% bear's-head door knocker to knock on the door.

Bart:	Hello! Lost lovable orphans!
	[a strange wind blows open the door for them.  They 
	enter]
Lisa:	Hmm, bowls of porridge.  Oh, this seems somehow 
	familiar.  Let's see ... [opens her book and begins 
	to read]
Bart:	[finding a large porridge bowl]  Hmm. [sticks his 
	finger in briefly] Oh, whoa!  Too hot!  Hmm. [sticks 
	his finger in medium porridge bowl] Oh, too cold.
	Well, this doesn't take a genius.
	[ignoring small bowl, pours medium bowl into large 
	bowl and eats it]
-- Gee, Mr. Wizard, "Treehouse of Horror XI"

% Lisa, still reading, figures out why the house seems so
% familiar -- they're in the three bears' house.  What's more,
% the owners have returned home.  Bart and Lisa hide behind the
% door as bears enter.  After the bears pass, they run out,
% block door with a chair, and run away.

Bart:		That was close!
Lisa:		I wonder where Goldilocks was?
		[cut back to inside the house]
Goldilocks:	Oh, that bed was just right!
		[notices the bears who look none too pleased.  
		She runs to door but can't open it due to the

% Meanwhile, back at the pumpkin cottage ...

Homer:	[dusting off his hands] Boy, dumping your kids in

Marge:	What? You threw our precious babies into the woods! 
	We could have sold them! [cut to Maggie sitting in 
	window with a sign reading, "Two chickens or best
