% Mayor `Diamond' Joe Quimby inaugurates the new Nuclear Disaster Warning Sign
% which contains the caption `Nuclear Plant Conditions' atop an electronic
% billboard.

Diamond Joe Quimby:  Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests,
       I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system.  In the
       off-chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the
       good citizens of Springfield, what to do!
       [sign lights up, ``Relax.  Everything is fine.'']
Crowd: Aah. [applause]
       [sign lights up, ``Minor leak.  Roll up window.'']
Crowd: Ooh. [mild applause]
       [sign lights up, ``Meltdown.  Flee city.'']
Crowd: [scattered applause]
       [sign lights up, ``Core explosion.  Repent sins.'']
Crowd: [stunned silence]
Homer: Hee hee.  Joke's on them.  If the core explodes, there won't be any
       power to light that sign!
-- Homer jokes with his coworkers about the Nuclear Disaster Warning Sign,
   ``Blood Feud''

% But Burns isn't present.  Smithers finds Burns flat on his back.

No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me.  As long as there's
an ounce of strength left in me, I... [passes out]
-- Monty Burns collapses from hypohemia, ``Blood Feud''

% Dr. Hibert diagnoses Burns with hypohemia.  Smithers offers his own blood,
% but he's the wrong blood type.

Smithers, don't feel so bad.  After all, that kidney you donated to me
really hit the spot.
-- Burns, consoling Smithers, who is unable to give the blood necessary
   to save his life, ``Blood Feud''

% When Smithers announces Burns' situation over the company PA system, nobody
% wants to help, and Homer scolds them.

I can't believe you guys.  There's a human being out there with millions
of dollars who needs our help.  And you don't want to cash in?
-- Homer tries to take the moral high ground when none of his coworkers
   wants to donate blood to save Mr. Burns, ``Blood Feud''

% At home, Lisa shows Maggie flashcards with exotic animals like the lemur
% and zebu.

[showing Maggie flashcards] Maggie, look!  What's that?  Lemur.
[slowly]  Le-mur.  [next card]   Zebu.  [slowly]  Ze-bu.
-- Lisa tries to enlighten Maggie, ``Blood Feud''

Marge: [watching Lisa show Maggie flashcards] What's a zebu?
Lisa:  It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap.
       [indicating to Maggie]  [sweetly] Hump, and a dewlap!  Hump and dewlap!
-- Lisa shows Maggie animal flashcards, ``Blood Feud''

% Homer comes in and asks Marge what his blood type is.  Marge impresses the
% family with her knowledge of everything about them, and mentions that Bart
% has the rare double O negative that Mr. Burns needs.  Bart refuses to give
% his blood, but Marge tells him it's the right thing to do.  And Homer tells
% Bart he'll be showered with gifts if he does...

Homer: Don't you know the story of Hercules and the lion?
Bart:  Is it a Bible story?
Homer: Yeah, probably.  Anyway, once upon a time, there was a big mean lion
       who got a thorn in his paw.  All the village people tried to pull it
       out, but nobody was strong enough!  So, they got Hercules.  And
       Hercules used his mighty strength, and Bingo!  Anyway, the moral is,
       the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big... thing... of riches.
Bart:  How did a lion get rich?
Homer: It was the olden days!
Bart:  Oh.
-- ``Blood Feud''

% The next day, Homer takes Bart to the Bloodmobile to donate the blood.
% The blood is rushed to the hospital, sort of.  As the blood transfusion
% is made...

Burns:    [weakly] Smithers, I'm not going to make it.  I want to
          dictate my epitaph.
Smithers: [choked with tears] Go ahead.
Burns:    Charles Montgomery Burns.  ... American...  Patriot... American...
          Patriot...  [gaining energy] Master of the atom. ... Scourge
          of the despot!  [really on a roll] Oh, tyrant!  Hear his
          mighty name, and quake! [gets up]  Smithers, I'm back!
-- Burns receives a badly-needed transfusion, ``Blood Feud''

% Burns arrives at work, bright and cheery.

Burns: Oh, top of the morning to ye!  Why, look who's here!
       It's ... good old... You!
Man:   Hi, Mr. Burns.
Burns: Oh, hey there, Mr. uh... Brown-Shoes!  How about that ..
       local sports team!
-- Mr. Burns is full of energy after his transfusion, ``Blood Feud''

% Burns also beats his opponent at jai alai.

Smithers, I'm back in the pink!  Full of pith and vinegar!
-- Mr. Burns is full of energy after his transfusion, ``Blood Feud''

You know, it's funny, Smithers.  I tried every tincture and poultice and
tonic and patent medicine there is, and all I really needed was the blood
of a young boy.
-- Mr. Burns is full of energy after his transfusion, ``Blood Feud''

Burns:    By the way, what was the lad's name?
Smithers: Uh, Bart Simpson, sir.
Burns:    Who?
Smithers: He's the son of Homer Simpson, sir.  One of your stiffs
          in sector 7-G.
-- Burns leans who donated the blood to save his life, `Blood Feud''

% Burns says Bart will be receiving a surprise in the mail.  At home...

Bill.     [tosses into wastebasket]
Bill.     [tosses into wastebasket]
Summons.  [tosses into wastebasket]
Bill.     [tosses into wastebasket]
-- Homer goes through the daily mail, ``Blood Feud''

% He then finds a letter from Burns.

Homer: Marge, Lisa, Maggie, let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors
       can see.  Lisa, dim the lights.  No, turn on more lights.  Oh, do
       something!
Lisa:  Yes, Dad. [turns on the sprinkler]
-- Homer prepares to open the letter from Mr. Burns, ``Blood Feud''

% But it's just a card that reads, ``Dear Bart, thank you kindly for the
% blood.  Yours truly, Montgomery Burns.''  Lisa turns off the sprinkler.

Some way to show your gratitude!  No gold, no diamonds, no rubies, not even
a lousy card!  Wait a minute... there <was> a card...
-- Homer is mad at Mr. Burns, whose only expression of gratitude was a
   thank-you card, ``Blood Feud''

Marge: Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded.  You do
       them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.
Homer: Marge, you're my wife, I love you very much, but [condescendingly]
       you're living in a world of make-believe!  With flowers and bells
       and leprechauns and magic frogs with funny little hats.
Bart: Yeah, Mom, we got hosed.
-- When Bart saves Mr. Burns' life with his donated blood, ``Blood Feud''

% But Homer is mad because he promised Bart lots of riches.

Homer: Bart!  Take a letter!
       Dear Mr. Burns...  [heavy sarcasm] I'm so `glad' you enjoyed my
       son's blood.  And your `card' was `just great'.  In case you can't
       tell, I'm being sarcastic.  You.. Stink!  Could you read that last
       part back to me?
Bart:  `You stink!'
Homer: Heh heh heh.  Good.  `You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy,
       with bony girl-arms, and you smell like...'
Bart:  An elephant's butt?
Homer: Hee hee.  `An elephant's butt.'
-- Homer writes a nasty letter to his boss, ``Blood Feud''

% Homer is about to mail the letter, but Marge convinces him to sleep on it.
% Homer's dream defies description.  The next morning, Homer thanks Marge
% for stopping him.  We see Bart walking down to the corner mailbox and
% putting the letter in.
%
% [End of Act 1.  Time: 9:35]
%
% Homer turns the house upside-down to find the letter, then learns Bart
% mailed the letter.  Homer attacks Bart, but Marge scolds him.  ``You
% should be strangling yourself.''  Homer and Bart try to retrieve the
% letter from the mailbox, with no success.

I'm with you, Homer!  Fight the Power!
-- Barney provides encouragement as Homer kicks the mailbox, ``Blood Feud''

Homer: I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will
       be able to read it!
Bart:  Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?
Homer: So a few people won't get a few letters, boo hoo!
       You know the kind of letters people write. ``Dear somebody you've
       never heard of, How is so-and-so?  Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
       Yours truly, some bozo.''  Big loss.
-- On watering the mail to prevent a letter from being mailed, ``Blood Feud''

% Before Homer can execute his plan, he's caught.

Homer: I guess it wouldn't do any good to run 'cause you're a mail-lady and you
       know my name and address and everything, huh?
Postal Worker: That's right.
Homer: Well.. I'm still going to run. [runs away]
-- Homer is caught tampering with a mailbox, ``Blood Feud''

% Meanwhile, Burns hires a ghost writer to help him write his story of his
% hypohemia incident.

Mr. Roman: First question.  Have you slept with anyone famous?
Burns: Well, Countess von Zeppelin and I...  [catches himself] What in blazes!
-- Burns hires a ghost writer, ``Blood Feud''

% Burns decides to write it himself.  Homer goes to the post office pretending
% to be Mr. Burns...

Homer: [trying to disguise his voice]
       Hello, my name is Mr. Burns.  I believe you have a letter for me.
Postal Clerk: Okay, Mr. Burns, uh, what's your first name?
Homer: [brief pause] I don't know.
       [outside on the steps of the post office] Great plan, Bart.
-- Trying to intercept a letter, ``Blood Feud''

% Back at the house...

Lisa:  Ooh, look, Maggie!  What is that?  Dodecahedron!  Dodecahedron!
Homer: Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange, and
       your father is trying to worry.
-- Lisa shows Maggie some very peculiar flashcards, ``Blood Feud''

% Burns continues writing his book as Homer sneaks into Burns' office
% to steal the letter.  Burns finds him...

Burns:  Who are you?
Homer:  [thinks] Don't tell him.  Give him a fake name.
        [aloud]  Homer Simpson.
        [thinks] D'oh!
-- Thinking fast on your feet, ``Blood Feud''

% ... and opens the letter.  Homer is taken away.

I could crush him like an ant.  But it would be too easy.  No, revenge is
a dish best served cold.  I'll bide my time until...  Oh, what the hell.
I'll just crush him like an ant.
-- Burns plans his next move, ``Blood Feud''

% [End of Act 2.  Time: 14:09]
%
% Burns tells Smithers to have Homer beaten to a pulp.  Back at home,
% Homer bemoans his fate.

Bart: You always told me I was going to destroy the family.  But I never
      believed it.
Lisa: That's okay, Bart.  Nobody really believed it.
      We were just trying to scare you.
-- Bart destroys the family, ``Blood Feud''

% An unshaven Smithers tries to tell Joe to beat up Homer, but can't do it.
% Meanwhile, Burns finishes up his book...

In closing, gentle reader, I'd like to thank you.
`What's that?' you say?  Me thanking you?
No, it's not a misprint, for you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much
as you enjoyed reading it.  The End.
-- Burns finishes his book, ``Blood Feud''

% Smithers comes in and says he didn't order the beating, since after all,
% Homer saved his life.  Burns is won over.  At Moe's Tavern, Homer
% drowns his sorrows in drink.

Moe:  [answers the phone]  Moe's Tavern, where the elite meet to drink.
Bart: Uh, hello.  Is Mike there?  Last name, Rotch.
Moe:  Hold on, I'll check. [calls]  Mike Rotch!  Mike Rotch!  Hey, has
      anybody seen Mike Rotch lately? [snickers from the patrons]
      [to phone] Listen, you little puke.  One of these days, I'm going
      to catch you, and I'm going to carve my name on your back with
      an ice pick.
-- Another phone prank, ``Blood Feud''

Moe:    What's the matter, Homer?  You're not your normal effervescent self.
Homer:  I got my problems, Moe.  Give me another one.
Moe:    Homer, hey.  You should not drink to forget your problems.
Barney: Yeah.  You should only drink to enhance your social skills. [belch]
-- But does it work? ``Blood Feud''

% Burns decides...

We'll get the Simpsons a present.  An extravagant present.  A mad, unthinkable,
utterly impossible present!  A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present!
-- Monty Burns meets Dr. Seuss? ``Blood Feud''

% After much searching, he finds it, for $32,000.  A huge crate is delivered to
% the Simpsons residence, and Burns gives Homer an advance copy of his
% book, ``Will There Ever Be a Rainbow?''

Burns: Hello, young fellow.  I haven't forgotten you.  Here.
Bart:  Wow, a crowbar!
Lisa:  It's to open the crate, stupid.
-- Burns gives the Simpsons a gift, ``Blood Feud''

% It's a 3000-year-old carved head of Xtapolapocetl [I definitely spelled
% it wrong, but I can't find it in my dictionary].

Maggie: [holds up an `Aztec' flashcard]
Lisa:   No, Maggie.  Not Aztec, Olmec.  [slowly]  Ol-mec.
Maggie: [falls down]
-- Lisa tries to enlighten Maggie, ``Blood Feud''

% Burns leaves.  The family eat dinner on TV dinner trays, watching the
% giant head do nothing.

Homer: Save a guy's life, and what do you get?  Nothing!  Worse than nothing!
       Just a big scary rock.
Bart:  Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head.
Marge: Homer, it's the thought that counts.  The moral of the story is a
       good deed is its own reward.
Bart:  Hey, we <got> a reward.  The head is cool.
Marge: Then... I guess the moral is no good deed goes unrewarded.
Homer: Wait a minute.  If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't've
       gotten anything.
Marge: Well... Then I guess the moral is the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Lisa:  Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
Homer: Exactly!  Just a bunch of stuff that happened.
Marge: But it certainly was a memorable few days.
Homer: Amen to that!
       [laughter all around]
-- We don't need no steenkin' morals, ``Blood Feud''
