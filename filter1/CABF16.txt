% Homer tells Hibbert what happened, and as he does so, his voice

%
% Homer is on an outdoor court at night.  He leaps up with ball
% and soars into outer space, past the shuttle, and the moon, which
% says, "You go Homer!"
%
% Homer goes past Saturn and slams the ball through Jupiter's

% Next day, OFF (minus Homer) is waiting in a waiting room.

Hibbert:	Now, Homer, you'll have a full recovery from your 
		spinal cord injury.
Marge:		What spinal cord injury?
Hibbert:	Oh, he fell off the gurney.  [Homer looks sheepish]  
		But it will take plenty of time and rehab before you 
		can go back to work.
Homer:		Miss work?  But my life would be nothing without the 
		nucleon plant.
Hibbert:	Oh, you're also responsible for this hefty hospital 
		bill.  You shouldn't have ordered all those hospital 
		haircuts and porno films.
Homer:		But "Doctor Screwlittle" sounded like a delightful

		[pointing off screen] Run!
-- "Children of a Lesser Clod"

% Homer stands and there is a horrible crunching sound, and he

% Marge pushes Homer's wheelchair out of the hospital, they are

% Shot of the outside of the house, then back to Homer as he

		[mutters] Stupid Flanders.
Flanders:	Hey Homer, I need to ask you a favour.  My 
		babysitter canceled and I've got tickets to a 
		Christian rock concert.  [holds up two tickets to 
		"Chris Rock in Concert"] It's going to be one 
		wholesome evening.  So, you think Marge could take

Homer:		Well, Marge isn't here.  She had to identify a body 
		at the morgue.
		[cut to morgue, where a man pulls a body from the

Marge:		That's not my Uncle Lou ... and this man's not dead.

Homer:		Well, they would keep me company ... and this pickle 
		you're offering only sweetens the deal.
-- Will watch children for food, "Children of a Lesser Clod"

% Later, in the living room.  Homer and Rod and Todd are
% watching TV, surrounded by candy and junk food.

Todd:	Mr. Simpson, can we have another jelly and candy sandwich?
Homer:	Sure, knock yourself out.  And call me Homer.

Flanders:	So, did you boys have a good time?
Rod:		Yeah, Mr. Simpson was really funny.

Flanders:	Well sir, I never heard a preacher use the M-F word

Homer:		Hey, it was fun.  My kids are sick of all my

Rod:		Can Mr. Simpson watch us -every- day?
Flanders:	Oh Roddy, he's not running a day-care center ...
Homer:		Don't tell me what I'm not doing.
Flanders:	So you are running a day care center?
Homer:		Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Flanders:	I sure would.  It would give the boys a place to go 
		after school.
Homer:		Then I'll do it, just to see the look on your face.  
		[Flanders smiles widely] That's the one.

Apu:	[running off] Yes, probably ...
-- "Children of a Lesser Clod"

% A month later, Homer's knee is completely healed.  Homer credits
% his ability to refrain from picking at the scar, and his work
% with children.  Only morphine gives him a bigger high.  Suddenly
% desperate, he asks Hibbert if he has any morphine.  Dr. Hibbert
% chuckles and gives Homer a syringe for the road.
%
% Cut to night exterior of OFF home.  Inside, Homer is playing
% peek-a-boo with baby Gerald.  He's been playing for two hours
% and even the baby is getting sick of it.  Rod and Todd interrupt
% the game so Homer can sing them that "crazy song" they love.
% Homer's song turns out to be "Is That All There Is?"  (And,

% Bart and Lisa are watching all this from the second-floor stair
