% everyone to leave nature clean by taking out everything they bring 
% in.  And she does mean everything.

Lisa:	Now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we 
	found it.  Everything we pack in, we pack out.
Homer:	What if I have to do my business?
Lisa:	Use this plastic bag.  [hands one to Homer]
Homer:	Aw, how come bears can crap in the woods and I can't?
	[after the family walks out of frame, a bear walks up to a 
	garbage can, and deposits a plastic bag]

% Lisa's revels in the beauty of nature are cut short by the sound of 
% angry buzzing.  Marge suspects Africanized "killer" bees are 
% swarming about.  Homer breaks out the bee repellent, giving his 
% family jewels an extra-long spray, just for good measure.
%
% Bart discovers that the noise is actually coming from cars racing 
% along Springfield's new racetrack.

Lisa:	The bird sanctuary -- they've ruined it!
Homer:	No, they didn't.  They just surrounded it with something 
	wonderful, like a raisin covered in chocolate, or a monkey 
	in a cowboy suit.
-- "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% The family crosses over the track -- in spite of the fact that cars 
% are running on it at the time -- and go to the infield.  Homer 
% remarks on how well the wildlife has adapted to their new neighbors.  
% Beavers build a dam with discarded tires, two squirrels duel with 
% socket wrenches, a parrot tells Marge, "show us your boobs," and a 
% chameleon changes colors to match an STP can.
%
% Lisa walks past a tree with initials carved into it and wonders 
% aloud, "Why do jerks think everyone wants to see their stupid name?"  
% By astonishing coincidence, the phrase "WRITTEN BY IAN MAXTONE-
% GRAHAM" appears on the screen in big, bold letters.
%
% The Simpsons settle down to a little picnic in the infield.  
% Suddenly, a car veers off the track, crashes hear them, and catches 
% fire.  The driver climbs out from under his upside-down car.

Babcock:	Sorry to break up your picnic, folks.  I'm two-time 
		Fast Car champ Clay Babcock.
Marge:		[pointing to some flames on Babcock's racing suit]
		You're on fire!
Babcock:	Yeah, I have won a lot of races, but it's all thanks 
		to my crew, really.
		[puts out the flames on his suit]
Bart:		Mr. Babcock, can I take a ride in your car?
Babcock:	Well, my "A" car was just incinerated, but you can 
		ride in my "B" car.  [a ball of flame leaps from the 
		"A" car]
Marge:		I don't see why not.
-- Coming soon:  Marge Visits the Eye Doctor, "Alone Again, Natura-

% In the "B" car, Babcock explains to Bart that these are the time 
% trials which determine the pole position.  [That is, the order in 
% which the drivers will start the race.  The fastest car in the 
% trials starts at the head of the field.]  Bart, lounging in the back 
% seat, is impressed with how roomy the car is.  Babcock says that 
% drivers like to take their families along, and his wife tells the 
% boy to get his feet off the upholstery.
%
% Babcock drives up to the rest of the family after his run.

Babcock:	Folks, I've got some spare tickets if you'd like to 
		stick around for the race.  [holds up some tickets]
Lisa:		That's very sweet but we have a full day of hiking 
		planned.
Homer:		We can hike anytime.  This is our chance to see cars 
		driving.  [takes the tickets]
-- Yeah, get your priorities straight, "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% When the race begins, the stands are packed with people taking the 
% opportunity to see cars driving.  The Simpsons are in the next-to-
% last row.  A familiar face makes an unexpected appearance.

Ned:		Hi-diddly-ho, petal-to-the-metal-ophiles.
Homer:		Flanders?  Since when do you like anything cool?
Ned:		Oh, I don't care for the speed, but I can't get 
		enough of that safety gear -- helmets, roll bars, 
		caution flags ...
Maude:		I like the fresh air, and looking at the poor people 
		in the infield.  [points]
		[cut to the infield.  Cletus and Brandine kiss in 
		the back of a pickup truck]
Brandine:	Dang, Cletus, why'd you have to park by my parents?
Cletus:		Now, honey, they's my parents, too.
		[another hick plays a banjo flourish]
-- Yee-ha, "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% The roar of engines heralds the start of the race.  The Flanders are 
% seated in the last row, just in front of the bleachers' back wall.  
% Rod wants to move closer to the action, but Ned wants him to stay 
% out of the range of the cussing.  (Not that it does much good, since 
% Bart does a little of his own.)
%
% There are several near-collisions, much to the disappointment of the 
% fans.

Bart:	[yelling to the cars] Come on, somebody crash!
Homer:	Be patient, son.  A watched car never crashes.
	[true to Homer's word, someone wrecks]  Oh, I missed one!
-- "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% One of the drivers comes in for a pit stop -- fuel, change of tires, 
% and a fresh set of fuzzy dice.  As he leaves, Homer comes in and 
% tries to get service.  When that doesn't work, he hastily pulls out 
% onto the track and causes a multi-car collision.
%
% As part of the day's activities, the girls from Fan-demonium come to 
% entertain the crowd.  Scantily dressed and armed with small cannons, 
% they ask what will be a fateful question:  "Who wants a free T-
% shirt?"  Everyone does, including Marge, until she realizes what 
% she's doing.
%
% The gals use the cannons to shoot T-shirts into the crowd.  Dr. 
% Hibbert catches one.

Dr. Hibbert:	[looking at shirt] Hmm, a Ford urinating on a 
		Chevrolet.
Mrs. Hibbert:	Don't you usually laugh at everything?
Dr. Hibbert:	[seriously] Yes.  Yes, I do.
-- "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% Lenny calls for a T-shirt, and an incoming tire knocks him over.  
% The bloodthirsty crowd groans when it realizes Lenny isn't hurt.
%
% Homer, shirtless, yells for a free T-shirt.

Homer:	I need a shirt!  Gimmie a shirt!
Ralph:	Mommy has bosoms like that.
Wiggum:	[sarcastic] Yeah, I wish.
-- "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% Maude needs a break.

Maude:	Neddy, I've had about all I can take of Homer Simpson's 
	torso.  I'll get some hot dogs.
Ned:	No foot-longs!
Maude:	I know, they make you uncomfortable.  [kisses Ned, then 
	goes for the food]
-- Famous last words, "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% Fan-demonium is about to wind down.

Girl:	[coyly] Well, I guess nobody else wants a T-shirt.
Homer:	That's a damn lie and you know it!  Gimmie a shirt!
Girl:	You heard him, girls.  [they take aim]
Homer:	[uses a ketchup bottle to draw a bull's-eye on his chest]  
	Hey T-shirt, T-shirt, T-shirt.
Girl:	Fire!  [they do, and five or six T-shirts head in Homer's 
	direction]
-- "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% Homer sees a bobby pin, and bends over to get it.  At that moment, 
% Maude returns with the hot dogs.  The T-shirts sail over Homer and 
% strike Maude.  The force knocks Maude off-balance, and sends her 
% over the bleacher's retaining wall.  She lands on the hard concrete 
% several stories down.
%
% A crowd instantly materializes to help but there is nothing they can 
% do.  Dr. Hibbert pronounces her dead on the spot.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time:  5:50]
%
% Marge and Homer are still in shock.

Marge:	It's hard to believe we're never going to see Maude again.
Homer:	And poor Ned didn't get a chance to say goodbye.  Well, 
	from now on I'm never going to let you leave the room 
	without telling you how much I love you and how truly 
	special ... [looks at his watch] This is really eating up 
	a lot of time.  Maybe just a pat on the butt.  [pats 
	Marge's butt]  Yeah, that works.
-- An incurable romantic, "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% Marge reminds Homer that Ned and the boys need their support, and 
% Homer understands.  "I know," he promises, "no more being a jerk."  
% Then, he sheds a tear.
%
% Rev. Lovejoy eulogizes Maude at her funeral.

Lovejoy:	In many ways, Maude Flanders was a supporting player 
		in our lives.  She didn't grab our attention with 
		memorable catchphrases, or comical accents.
Willie:		Aye.
McAllister:	Yar.
Frink:		Oh, glaven, why, glaven?
Lovejoy:	But, whether you noticed her or not, Maude was 
		always there ... and we thought she always would be.
-- "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% The Reverend continues.

Lovejoy:	My friends, life is about change.  Just yesterday, 
		Apu was a lonely bachelor.
Apu:		[holding the octuplets] Yes, thank God those days 
		are over.
Lovejoy:	And the Van Houtens were enjoying a storybook 
		marriage.
Kirk:		Yeah, lots of storybooks have witches.
Pyro:		Shut up, Kirk!
Kirk:		[sheepish] Sorry.

% As part of the legal settlement, the Fan-demonium girls are on hand 
% to fire a 21 T-shirt salute.  Dressed in black bikinis and veils,

%
% The wake is held at the Simpson house.  Apu offers Ned his

Moe:	Look, Ned, I know we ain't hung out much, what with your 
	insane fear of drinking and me being banned from the 
	church and all but, uh, but that Maude, she was really 
	something.
Ned:	Aw, wasn't she?  Thank you, Moe.  I appreciate that.
Moe:	No, I really mean it, though.  I mean, if it was you that 
	died, I would have been on her so fast ...
Ned:	What are you saying?
Moe:	What, nothing; she was hot.  What?  You can't take a 
	compliment?
Ned:	[sputters] You monster!  [hits Moe repeatedly]

% Ned isn't as easy to console.  Homer, making a sincere effort to be 
% helpful walks him home, through the yard, past the sprinkler, which

% says that the sprinkler is gone now, and it is time to move on.
%
% Homer continues to be helpful, more or less, all the way to Ned's

%
% The sound of stones hitting the bedroom window awakens Homer.  He 
% goes to the window and finds Ned in his yard.  Homer surmises 
% Flanders wants a rock fight, and gets his bucket of war rocks ready, 
% but it isn't necessary.  Ned just needs someone to talk to.  Homer 
% goes downstairs, but grabs a handful of stones from the bucket, just 
% in case.
%
% Ned and Homer sit on the swings in the backyard and talk.

Ned:	I just keep replaying the whole thing in my head.  I can't 
	believe my last words to Maude were, "No foot-longs."
Homer:	Yep, it would have been a lot better if you had said, "I 
	love you," or "You're special."  You know, something sweet 
	instead of that hot dog crack.
Ned:	If I'd only been a gentleman, and got the hot dogs myself, 
	she'd still be here.
Homer:	Now, now, now, don't beat yourself up.  I'm the one who 
	drove her out of her seat.  I'm the one who provoked the 
	lethal barrage of T-shirts.  I'm the one who parked in the 
	ambulance zone, preventing any possible resuscitation.  
	[notices Ned glaring at him] Yeah, I, uh, but there's no 
	point in playing the blame game.
Ned:	Ah, you're right.  I've just got to work through the

Homer:	Easy answer, eh?
-- The wheels are turning, "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly"

% The next day, Homer videotapes Ned clipping his hedges.

Homer:	So, how are you doing, Ned?

%
% Some time later, Ned plays Scrabble (TM), but with no suitable
