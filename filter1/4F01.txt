 Skinner: What?  What!?
Chalmers: Ah, you're getting paranoid.

You know, I used to think a car was just a way of getting from point A

man died the moment I laid eyes on a 1979 Honda Accord.
-- Chalmers, practical and emotional, "Lisa's Date With Density"

% Skinner calms him down and says he could find a replacement.  Moments
