% banner.

 Skinner: And now, to top off our most propane-explosion-free science
          week ever, our grand finale: the launching of a weather
          balloon!
Children: Yay!
    Bart: Go, weather balloon!  Hurrah for science, woo!
 Skinner: [to himself] "Hurrah for science, woo"?  I can't say I approve
          of the "woo" but the "hurrah" was quite heartening.
-- Skinner, censurer, "Bart's Comet"

% "Release the balloon," calls the beloved principal.  Groundskeeper
% Willy complies, snipping its string.  Everyone cheers as the balloon
% rises except for Bart, who pulls a string, smiling.  Two flaps on the
% balloon unfold, one with Skinner's head and arms holding a "Hi, I'm
% Big Butt Skinner" sign, the other with Skinner's legs.  The children
% all point and laugh.  "Nooo!" cries Skinner, running after it.

    Bart: I don't think I really captured the eyes.
Milhouse: Bart, if you have a failing, it's that you're always demanding
          perfection -- _if_ you have a failing.
 Skinner: Whoever brings down that balloon doesn't have to learn
          fractions!
Children: Yay!  [start throwing rocks at it]
 Skinner: [hearing clanking noises] Uh, careful, children, that's my
          car...

          who did this...Bart!  Empty your pockets.

          fail to see how --
 Skinner: [picking something up] Hmm...blueprints of the dummy...

   Bart: Is that the telescope we're going to be looking through?
Skinner: Yes, but you won't be looking through it: I forbid it, heh heh.
         But you don't _need_ a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart:
         there are all the constellations you've heard so much about.
         [pointing] There's Orion, the swan, the chariot race --
   Bart: Why don't they look anything like their names?
Skinner: Well, you do have to use your imagination.  Look: there's the
         three wise men.  [points to Curly, Larry, and Moe]
-- Wise at slapstick, maybe, "Bart's Comet"

   Bart: Who names these things [the constellations] anyway?
Skinner: Whoever discovers them.  I've been hoping I could find
         something that would be named after me.
   Bart: And you've never found anything?
Skinner: Once...but by the time I got to the phone, my discovery had
         already been reported by Principal Kahoutek...[a cloud covers

   Bart: So what am I supposed to do exactly?
Skinner: Just write down my findings as I give them to you.  Six hours

          I asked my mother, "What will I be?
          Will I be pretty?  Will I be rich?"
          Here's what she said to me:
Everyone: [joining in] Que sera, sera,
          Whatever will be, will be
          The future's not ours to see
          Que sera --
  Quimby: [pointing at the comet] Run!
-- Forced bravado, "Bart's Comet"

% The comet speeds towards Springfield, through the polluted atmosphere.
% Chunks of it start to fly off.  "Look!" cries Marge, "It's breaking
% up!" yells Lisa.  The rapidly diminishing-in-size comet punctures the
% Skinner weather balloon, then places a direct hit on Ned's bomb
% shelter -- destroying it in a pile of masonry.

    Bart: Cool.  [picks up what's left of the comet]
    Lisa: We're saved!
Everyone: Yay!
   Selma: Sure makes you appreciate the preciousness of life.
           [she and Patty light a cigarette and puff contentedly]
     Moe: Let's go burn down the observatory so this will never happen
          again.
-- Moe's miracle cure, "Bart's Comet"

% Lisa is astounded.

 Lisa: I can't believe that extra-thick layer of pollution that I've
       actually picketed against burned up the comet.
 Bart: But what's really amazing, is that this is _exactly_ what Dad
       said would happen.
 Lisa: Yeah, Dad was right.
Homer: I know, kids.  I'm scared too!
-- Homer "Nostradamus" Simpson, "Bart's Comet"

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 20:57]

% Over the closing credits, an orchestral version of "Que Sera, Sera"
% plays.
