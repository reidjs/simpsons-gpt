% a portrait of Marge and a framed sign, ``No foolish horseplay.''
% Homer reaches his arms towards Bart.

H: Leap into your father's arms.  Come on, just like the old days!
B: I'm too big now, Dad.  There's no way.

% As Homer continues to plead, Bart does some knee bends and otherwise
% prepares to jump.

H: Come on, boy!  Leap!  Do it!  Atta boy!  Come on, Bart!

% Bart not so much leaps as hops feebly off the table, landing on (and
% bouncing off) his spiky-haired head.  Homer scowls.

H: You call that a leap?

% [End of Act One.]
%
% Bart is back on the table.  Bart is annoyed in a bored, whiney sort of way.
% During the conversation, Bart continues doing knee bends and otherwise
% preparing to jump.

B: Dad, why are we doing this?
H: You've always afraid of falling on your head ever since you were a
   little baby.  I'm trying to help you overcome that fear.
B: You want me to jump because I've always been ... jumpy?

% Bart jumps...

H: [laughs] That's a good one son.  Always been jumpy! [laughs more]

% ... and lands on his butt because Homer was laughing too hard.
%
% [End of Act Two.]
%
% Back on the table.  Bart is whining.  His forehead has a small bandage,
% as well as an unbandaged bruise.

B: Daaad, this is really dumb.  My head still from the last two times...
H: Let's go, boy.  No excuses.  Leap!  Leap, boy!  I wanna see some
   gumption!

% Bart closes his eyes, clenches his fists, and starts doing knee bends in
% preparation for a really big leap.

H: Leap like you never, um...  Leap like you never...

% Homer turns his head to the side, mentally distracted.

H: What's the past tense of leap?

% Homer wanders off in search of a dictionary just as Bart jumps.

H: Leapt?  Leaped?  That doesn't sound right...

% Bart lands on his head, bounces once, and reclines on the floor yet
% again, a new bruise on his shirt.  The usual cartoon embellishments
% emanate from Bart's head.
%
% Off-screen, Homer flips through the dictionary.  (Three page flips.)
% He returns, dictionary in hand, and all smiles.

H: Well, whaddya know!  Leaped <and> leapt.  They're <both> right!

% [End of Act Three.]
%
% You know the set-up.

B: But Dad...
H: I haven't got all day.  Now leap, and give it all you got.
B: Do I have to?
H: Bart!

% The doorbell rings.

H: I'll get it.

% Homer turns and leaves.  Meanwhile, Bart has closed his eyes and
% jumped.  He lands on his head, bounces twice, and lies, inert,
% flat on his back.
%
% Homer returns, four boxing gloves in his hand.

H: Good news, son!  The boxing gloves have arrived!

% [End of Act Four.]
