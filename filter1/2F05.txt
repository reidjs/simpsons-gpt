% Three players check Lisa into the net, and the crowd cheers.  Bart
% gets the puck only to be slammed into the board, and the crowd cheers
% again.  Hans Moleman trips down the stairs, and the crowd points and
% cheers.  With 1:07 left in the third, the score knotted at three,
% Jimbo makes a break, only to have the puck stolen by Bart.

           [on the ice, Jimbo trips Bart]
    Marge: He tripped my boy!  I demand vengeance.  I want vengeance!
Announcer: Jimbo Jones, called for tripping.  The penalty shot will be
           taken by Bart Simpson.
    Homer: Oh my God, Marge.  A penalty shot with only four seconds
           left.  It's your child versus mine!  The winner will be
           showered with praise; the loser will be taunted and booed
           until my throat is sore!
-- Homer, caring parent, "Lisa on Ice"

% Bart skates to center ice and puts his stick down emphatically.

    Wiggum: Kill her, boy!
       Apu: Stop him dead, little girl!
Bart crowd: _Kill_, Bart!  _Kill_, Bart!  _Kill_, Bart!
Lisa crowd: Kill _Bart_!  Kill _Bart_!  Kill _Bart_!
-- Bart takes a penalty shot, "Lisa on Ice"

% Bart and Lisa look around at the angry crowd, then Bart stops,
% remembering a time when he lifted baby Lisa up to the cookie jar so
% she could get a cookie for him.  Lisa remembers a time when she
% clapped happily as a young Bart made finger shadows for her in front
% of a tilted lamp.  Bart thinks of Lisa helping him bandage his knee
% after a skateboarding accident.  Lisa remembers eating ice cream by
% the wading pool and dropping her scoop, only to have Bart give her a
% scoop of his.
%
% Both children smile, throw aside their equipment, and hug.  "Great
% game, Lis."  "Great game, Bart."  The buzzer sounds

  Man 1: What the heck is a tie game?
  Man 2: Tie game?
Woman 1: What the hell?
Woman 2: This is outrageous!
  Marge: Oh, I've never been so proud of them.
  Homer: [weeping] They're both losers.  Losers!
    Abe: Rip-off!
   Hans: We paid for blood!
 Wiggum: Let's tear this place apart!
    Abe: Good idea!
-- A good-old hockey riot, "Lisa on Ice"

% Everyone rips into things and pummels each other.  Bart and Lisa skate
% slowly down the ice, arm-in-arm.

Snake: Those kids are, like, so sweet.  [sobs] If only they had had
       peewee hockey when I was a lad.  [sniffs] Oh well.
        [grabs crowbar, rips seats apart]
-- Yet another lesson lost, "Lisa on Ice"

% The final shot shows people punching one another and fires burning
% inside the arena.

% The theme music over the credits is played on an organ so that it
% sounds as though it's from a hockey game.
