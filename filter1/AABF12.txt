Homer:	Hey, that's super.  See you later.
Lisa:	Dad, don't you remember?  It's our special Saturday.
Marge:	You agreed to spend one Saturday a month doing something 
	with the kids.
Homer:	Ohhh.  [slaps forehead]
Bart:	Oh, quit complaining.  It's half the work of a divorced

Homer:	Yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad.
Marge:	[scolding] Homer!
Homer:	They know I'm kidding.
	[Bart and Lisa look dejected]
	Okay, Bart, it's your turn to pick, where are we headed?  
	Bowling?  Demolition derby?  P. J. O'Harrigan's?  Isn't 
	that a funny name?  Huh?  Huh?
Bart:	Hysterical, but I traded my turn to Lisa for her dessert.
Homer:	D'oh!  But we did a Lisa thing last month -- [notices 
	Marge glaring at him, and changes to a happier tone of 
	voice] -- and I'm glad we did.  But now I think we should 
	do something that normal people would like.
Lisa:	Why do you assume that I won't pick something fun?  Let's

	America and makes history come alive!
Homer:	What, and Marmaduke doesn't.
Lisa:	No, Dad, my mind is made up.
Homer:	[to Bart] This is all your fault for trading away your

% surrounded by a laser beam perimeter alarm.  Lisa wonders how this

% considerably less sturdy case next to the jacket.
%
% Lisa explains what the Bill of Rights grants the country, but stops 
% when she sees that Homer has removed the document from its case for

		[rustles the page, causing it to rip]

		Rights!
Guard 2:	Look - he got chocolate on it!
Homer:		I didn't mean to.  [licks off the chocolate]

		cruel and unusual punishment.
Guard 2:	[chuckles and dons a set of brass knuckles]
