        anyway?
  Carl: Yeah, Homer, what's your secret investment?
 Homer: Take a guess.
Barney: Uh, pumpkins?
 Homer: [pause] Yeah, that's right, Barney.  This year, I invested in
        pumpkins.  They've been going up the whole month of October and
        I got a feeling they're going to peak right around January.
        Then, bang!  That's when I'll cash in.

  Homer: Well, good luck finding it, because I'm going to take the

       like he teased Moses in the desert.
Marge: Tested, Homer!  God tested Moses.  And try to be nice to my
       sisters.  It's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time.
Homer: Oh, OK Marge, I'll get along with them.  Then, I will hug some
       snakes...yes!  Then, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes.
       Now _that's_ sarcasm.

Selma: Failed to check blind spot.  Minus two points.
Homer: You won't be happy until my family thinks I'm a loser, will you?

Marge: [walking up] So, Homer, how'd you do?
Homer: [glum] Well, I...
Super: Ladies, please don't tell me you're smoking in a government
       building.  Because that is _precisely_ the kind of infraction
       that can cost a couple of sisters their promotion.
        [they gasp, and stammer]
Homer: [chuckles to himself] [sees Marge looking unhappy]
        [sighs] I'll never forgive myself for this.
        [grabs both cigarettes, drags]
Super: Wait a minute!  Those are yours, sir?

Homer: Please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your
       hides!
Marge: That's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
Homer: I didn't do it for them...I did it for _you_, Marge.  I'd kill
       for you.  Please ask me to kill for you --
Marge: No, Homey.  You see?  You see, this is the stuff I've been
       telling you about that you never see!
Patty: Homer...we're...sorry.
Selma: If there's anything we can do to make it up --
Homer: Call off the debt?
Patty: Or, say, we could let you pass your driver's test --
