George: Hmm.  Can't decide if this'll be considered feisty, or crazy.
-- I'm voting for the latter, "Two Bad Neighbors"

% Suddenly, Bush sees Homer and Bart walking through the sewer toward
% his house.  "Oh, if he thinks George Bush'll stay out of the sewer, he
% doesn't know George Bush."  He removes the cover from a grating and
% hops down.

George: Hey, turkeys!  Behind you.
         [Bart and Homer turn around]
 Homer: For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!
George: Never!  You make him apologize for destroying my memoirs.
 Homer: You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs...
         [to Bush] Never!  [charges him]
-- The clear boundary between right and wrong, "Two Bad Neighbors"

% The two grapple and struggle.  Bush throws Homer to the ground, but
% Homer flings slime in his eyes, runs around the side of the sewer, and
% body slams Bush.  "Yay, Dad!" cheers Bart.
%
% Marge has invited Bar over for tea.

Barbara: I really feel awful about your lawn, Marge.  George can be so
         stubborn when he thinks he's right.
  Marge: Well, Homer, too.  They're so much alike.
Barbara: Too bad they got off on the wrong foot.  It's just like the
         Noriega thing.  Now, he and George are the best of friends.
-- Bygones, "Two Bad Neighbors"

% Under the street, Homer and George pant.  Bush removes a piece from
% his watch and pulls out a length of piano wire.  "Here's a little
% something we learned in CIA," he grins.  Bart releases the locusts on
% Bush, inciting them to "Get him, boys!"  Above-ground, Mikhail
% Gorbachev brings a gift to Bush's house and rings the doorbell.
% "Hello?  Hello!"
%
% The sewer grate pops off, and out come Homer and Bush, still fighting.

 George: I'll ruin you like a Japanese banquet!  I'll take your head and
         -- Gorbachev!  Heh, what are you doing here?
Mikhail: I just dropped by with present for warming of house.  Instead,
         find you grappling with local oaf.
  Homer: Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight
         dirty, eh?
 George: But Mikhail, they put a wig on my head, my memoirs --
Barbara: George!  This is the last straw.  You apologize to Homer right
         now!
 George: But Bar, [quietly] we can't show any weakness in front of the
         Russians.
Barbara: [reproachful] George...
 George: [pause] Yes, dear.
Mikhail: [speaks Russian to his driver, and laughs]
-- No translation needed, "Two Bad Neighbors"

George: I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer.
 Homer: Woo hoo!  In your face, Bush.  Now apologize for the tax hike.
-- Giving him an inch..., "Two Bad Neighbors"

% Bush frowns, and walks off.
%
% Barbara goes to say goodbye to Marge.

Barbara: It's a shame it didn't work out, Marge, but George just felt
         this neighborhood brought out the worst in him, and --
          [Bush honks his horn impatiently]
         -- oh, my.  Well, so long.
          [Bar gets in; they drive off]
  Marge: Bye bye.
-- So endeth another chapter, "Two Bad Neighbors"

% No sooner have the Bushes departed that another moving truck pulls in
% along with a car with license plate "Mr. Duh".

Gerry: Hi!  Pleased to meet you, I just moved in.  My name is Gerry
       Ford.
Homer: [gasps] Former President Gerald Ford?  Put her there!  I'm Homer
       Simpson!
Gerry: Say, Homer, do you like football?
Homer: Do I ever!
Gerry: Do you like nachos?
Homer: Yes, Mr. Ford.
Gerry: Well, why don't you come over and watch the game, and we'll have
       nachos?  And then, some beer.
Homer: Ooh!
        [they walk across the street]
       Gerry, I think you and I are going to get along just --
        [they both trip]
 Both: D'oh!
-- Homer's rumpy doppelganger, "Two Bad Neighbors"
