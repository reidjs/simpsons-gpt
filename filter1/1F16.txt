% It's another day at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.  Homer sits
% idly at his work station, rolling a donut morosely back and forth.

Homer: [sighs] Lousy job.  Nothing exciting ever happens.
        [A fanfare plays; an emcee and a scantily clad woman appear]
Emcee: Congratulations, Homer Simpson!  You've just won the employee
       raffle.
Homer: Woo hoo!  What do I get?
Emcee: The job of industrial chimney sweep.
        [Silence; a "BIG WINNER!" sign flashes in the background]
Homer: Woo hoo!
-- Delayed reaction, "Burns' Heir"

% The job consists of being strung from a crane with batting wrapped
% around oneself and dipped into tall smokestacks.  Homer is pulled from
% the chimney coughing from the soot -- "Hey!  This isn't such a great
% prize" -- but he consoles himself with the fact that the big guys at
% the top work even harder.
%
% Cut to Mr. Burns sitting in his bathtub watching Homer on TV.  Burns
% sports a top hat and cigar; an open bag of extra fancy potato chips
% rests on a stool next to him.  Munching on a chip, he sighs, "Will
% five o'clock _never_ come?"

   Burns: Careful, Smithers!  That sponge has corners, you know.
Smithers: I'll go find a spherical one, sir.
-- Mr. Burns takes a bath, "Burns' Heir"

% Smithers leaves, putting the sponge on Mr. Burns' hat.  The weight of
% it is too much for the feeble Burns, and he sinks slowly into the bath
% water.  Fearing his death, his life flashes before his eyes.  A baby
% Monty drinks from a bottle in a nanny's arms, but the milk is not to
% his liking, and in a fit of pique, he fires her.  As a young man,
% Burns shoots a gun at another man's feet, telling him, "Dance!"  The
% man does so briefly, then stops while Burns reloads.

Man 1: All right!  We're finally going to stop those corporate pigs from
       dumping that nuclear waste!
Man 2: Oh, no!  Our boat is sinking!
Burns: It was I, you fools!  The man you trusted wasn't Wavy Gravy at
       all!  [tosses a guitar away] And all this time, I've been smoking
       harmless tobacco.
-- Burns foils Greenpeace, "Burns' Heir"

% Wavy Burns jumps off the boat, pulls the cord to inflate his life
% jacket, and swims off cackling.
%
% Smithers returns to the bathroom.

Smithers: I got a mink chamois, sir, I hope it -- Oh my God!  Mr. Burns
          is dead!  [sobs] Why do the good always die so young?
   Burns: [rising from the water] You almost killed me!  [strangles him]
Smithers: Please...sir...[wraps a towel around him] You'll catch...
          cold...
-- Devotion to duty, "Burns' Heir"

% Later, Mr. Burns sits in front of the fire tended by Smithers.

   Burns: Smithers, do you realize if I had died, there would be no one
          to carry on my legacy.  Due to my hectic schedule and
          lethargic sperm, I never fathered an heir.  Now I have no one
          to leave my enormous fortune to.  No one.
Smithers: Ahem --
   Burns: You, Smithers?  Oh no, my dear friend.  I've planned a far
          greater reward for you.  When I pass on, you shall be buried
          alive with me.  [Opens a miniature coffin containing dead
          Burns and aghast Smithers]
Smithers: Oh...goody.
-- Contagious enthusiasm, "Burns' Heir"

% The next scene is at a movie theater where "Siskel and Ebert: The

% cause a man's head to explode.  Everyone cheers anyway, except for
% Abe, who calls, "Turn it up!  Turn it up!"
%
% Instead of previews, Mr. Burns is shown in a large green field.

Burns: Hello, I'm Montgomery Burns.
Homer: Aah!
Burns: Now then, I'm looking for a suitable young male heir to leave my
       fortune to when I pass away -- my vast, vast, _vast_ fortune.

% The next night, at Burns' estate, every young boy in Springfield is
% there with his parents, including Martin, Milhouse, Ralph, and Bart.
% In his private auditorium, Mr. Burns sits in a row by himself, the
% illustrious Smithers holding a clipboard behind him.  First up on the

Milhouse: I have nothing to offer you but my love.

   Burns: Thank you!  Give the bully an extra point.
-- The tryouts begin, "Burns' Heir"

    Lisa: [clears throat] I propose to you that your heir not need be a

   Burns: Er, I don't know what phallocentric means, but no girls!
Milhouse: [offstage, in drag] So much for Plan B.
-- Lousy four-syllable words, "Burns' Heir"

% Next up is Bart.

Homer: That's it, boy: you're our last hope.
 Bart: Aw, I just don't want to be here, Dad.  Besides, I started a fire
       this morning that I really should keep an eye on.
-- Bart gets cold feet, "Burns' Heir"

% Marge tries to steel his courage by reminding him that he'll have his
% whole future provided for.  In her imagination, Bart walks across the
% stage at Harvard to receive his diploma.  Marge watches proudly from
% the audience until Lee Majors approaches her and asks her to come away
% with him.  She readily agrees, and he carries her in his arms and
% leaps bionically into the air.  Back in reality, Marge thinks she
% should stop fantasizing about the bionic man, but says, "Ehh, one
% more."

Homer: OK, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say.  Just read it and
       you're a shoo-in!
 Bart: [walks onstage, squints at cue cards] Hello, Mr. ...Kurns.  I bad
       want...money now.  Me sick.
Homer: Ooh, he card-reads good.
 Bart: So pick please me, Mr. Burns.
Homer: {[calling from offstage] It's "Kurns", stupid!}
Marge: {No it's not!}
Homer: {Disregard.}
-- "Burns' Heir"

% Burns is so frustrated at Bart's incompetence that he orders everyone
% out except for Bart, who he orders one step to the left.  Bart
% complies, only to have Burns turn some giant wheels to manipulate a
% boot to kick him.  Homer can't contain his mirth -- "The boot kicked
% Bart!  It kicked him right in the butt!" he laughs.
%
% As the family walk down the driveway afterwards, Marge observes her
% children's melancholy.

Marge: I think Bart and Lisa are feeling a little upset right now.
       Isn't there something you'd like to say?
Homer: There sure is.  Kids, you tried your best, and you failed
       miserably.  The lesson is, never try.  Heh heh heh -- right in
       the butt.  That was great.
-- A one-track mind, "Burns' Heir"

% Burns, too, is dejected.  He sits in his office to mull things over.

   Burns: It's no use.  I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the
          Egg Advisory Council.  Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap
          lately, you know, Smithers.
           [A rock crashes through the window]
          Ooh, look!  A bird has become petrified and lost its sense of
          direction.
Smithers: I think it's a rock, sir.
   Burns: We'll see what the lab has to say about _that_.
-- Rock, petrified bird...what's the difference?, "Burns' Heir"

% Another petrified bird joins the first.  The two men go over to the
% window to look for the flock, but instead they see Bart smashing
% windows with reckless abandon.  "Why, that rapscallion is breaking all
% my windows!" observes Burns.  And that's not all -- Bart wraps a loop
% of hose around some statues' heads, puts the nozzle in a car, and
% turns the water on, thereby popping the heads right off _and_ flooding
% the car.  To add insult to injury, Bart removes the "No Solicitors"
% sign from Burns' gate; the results are immediate.

Burns: Heh heh, look, Smithers -- a creature of pure malevolence.  He's
       the perfect one to suckle at my proverbial teat.  [opens window]

  Boy: [cockney accent] Today?  Sir, why, it's Christmas Day!
Burns: I was talking to _him_.  You!  What day is this?
 Bart: Huh?
Burns: I'll tell you what day this is: today is the day you become my

Marge: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Homer: Yeah.  Let's push him down the steps.
-- That's not it, "Burns' Heir"

Marge: Bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be
       nice if you'd spend some time with him.
 Bart: Well...
Marge: Come on, honey.
 Bart: All right.
Homer: Aw, how come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night
       lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boy-Ar-Dee's house?

% Bart goes over for dinner.  He sits at one end of a long table while
% Monty sits at the other.

Burns: Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of "booger man",

       Oh, sorry -- wrong button.
 Bart: Uh...I think I'd like to go home.
Burns: Oh, this day, you can have anything you want to eat.  Even...some

%
% At home that night, Bart describes his evening to his family.

% {Bart walks out of the living room and} rides his bike off to Burns'

   Burns: What?  Fire _me_?  That does it: you can _never_ be my son!
    Bart: A little to the left.

% At home, shortly afterwards...

Homer: Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV
       saying we didn't want you in our family.  But those were just
       actors playing us!
 Bart: How do you know?
Homer: Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my
       character down.
 Lisa: Yeah, me too.  That midget taught me a lot about his native
       Estonia.
Marge: The point is, the real Simpson family missed you a lot and we're
       really glad you're home.  [kisses him]
 Bart: I love you guys.
Homer: Right back at you, son.
        [they all hug]
       And now I want you to meet your new brother: Hans Moleman.
        [Hans walks in dressed like Bart, holding a skateboard]
 Hans: Cowabunga, dudes.
        [Homer kisses him repeatedly]
Homer: Try it.  It's like kissing a peanut!  Heh heh heh.
