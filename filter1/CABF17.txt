% The family is at the Air Delaware ticket counter, ready to embark on

Marge:	I can't believe it!  We won another contest!

% boxcar.

Homer:	The Simpsons are riding the rails!
	[Bart notices a man lying on the floor of the boxcar]

Hobo:	Morning, folks.
Homer:	W-What are you going to do to us?
Hobo:	Don't worry, I'm not a stabbing hobo, I'm a singing hobo.

Hobo:	[laughs] Ah, sure.  I, I was just having a little fun with 
	you "no-bos."  Here's ballad that will set fire to your 
	trash can.
-- Do hobos take requests?  "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% The hobo sings an introduction to a classic tall tale.

Wont'cha listen to my tale that's ten stories tall,
'Bout a king-sized woodsman, name a' Bunyan comma Paul?
-- Hobo, "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% A back-country doctor congratulates Abe on his new son, a strapping
% young lad who is nearly the size of a log canyon.  Abe rushes to his
% wife's side and asks if she is okay.  Exhausted, she asks only for
% some whiskey.
%
% "Born mighty big, he continued to expand, thanks to a hopped-up
% pituitary gland," the hobo sings.  Homer, as young Paul Bunyan,
% tries to play as boys normally do, but childhood activities doesn't
% always scale well.  To make a snowball, he tears off the top of a
% mountain and throws it at his boyhood chum, burying the poor fellow.
%
% "His body grew big, but his brain stayed small.  He was tree-
% choppin', branch-stompin', house-crushin' Paul," the hobo sings with
% a flourish.  As a full-grown man, Homer has found work in a lumber
% camp.  He is an efficient lumberjack, leveling a forest as easily as
% you or me might mow the lawn.  Moe, the camp cook, prepares Homer's
% flapjack breakfast.  It's a feat of engineering.  Two men grease an
% enormous pan by strapping large blocks of butter to their feet, and
% skating across its surface.  When the swimming-pool sized flapjacks
% are ready, Moe calls Homer to breakfast.  Homer runs to camp,
% leaving a trail of crushed log cabins.  He eats the giant flapjacks
% in one gulp.

Moe:	All right, let's get started on lunch.  And, uh ... wait, 
	where's Lenny?
	[cut to inside Homer's stomach.  Lenny is standing waist-
	deep in fluid]
Lenny:	Hello?  Can anybody hear me?
	[Willie surfaces from somewhere below]
Willie:	I think I found a way out.  It's not pretty, but it'll do.  
	[both men dive]
-- I *don't* want to know, "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% The townspeople have had enough, and convene a meeting.

Moe:	We gotta do something about Bunyan.  We're going bankrupt 
	just feeding and clothing the guy.  Not to mention the 
	crushings.
	[the crowd murmurs in agreement]
Carl:	Hey!  I say we get him drunk, and drag him out of town -- 
	same way we got rid of Laura Ingalls Wilder.
	[the crowd murmurs its assent]
-- "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% So, the townsfolk offer Homer a wagonload of beer.  Homer's
% appreciative, calling the town the "greatest friends a giant doofus
% can have."  He drinks it down, and passes out.  Skinner is amazed it
% took only one beer to take Homer down (albeit a beer the size of a
% Conestoga), and Moe admits to spiking the beer with several giant
% knockout pills.
%
% The morning after, Homer wakes up outside of town.  (Not that far
% outside -- you can only drag a man Homer's size so far.)  He takes
% the hint and sadly leaves.
%
% The hobo's song picks up the narrative.

Paul was just as lonely as a man could get,
So he took out his axe and he carved himself a pet.
-- Hobo, "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% And that's exactly what Homer does, cutting a block of stone from a
% nearby mountain, and skillfully carving it into the shape of an ox. 
% Wishing that he had a real pet, Homer falls asleep against the ox. 
% That night, a weird aurora fills the sky.  A spark jumps from lights
% to the ox statue, bringing it to life.  Homer calls his new blue
% friend "Babe."  During their travels around the country, they create
% several new landmarks.  Smoke from their brandy-and-cigar party
% creates the Great Smoky Mountains.  After Homer and Babe lay waste
% to a valley, it becomes known as Death Valley.  Finally, they dance
% around with mugs of beer.  The beer sloshes from their mugs, filling
% the holes created from their footsteps and creating Big Holes with
% Beer National Park.  (Mmmm ... beer holes.)
%
% Their adventures culminate with a fight between Homer and Rodan.  We
% cut back to the railcar.

Lisa:	Excuse me, Paul Bunyan never fought Rodan.  And his size 
	is really inconsistent.  I mean, one minute he's ten feet 
	tall, and the next his feet are as big as a lake.
Hobo:	Hey, hey, hey -- who's the hobo here?
Lisa:	I'm just saying.
-- Lisa, the CBG of tall tales, "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% The story continues as the hobo sings, "Now Paul and Babe were a
% mighty fine match, But the man had an itch than an ox couldn't
% scratch."  Homer is riding Babe, and sees Marge plowing a field in
% the distance.  Marge spots Homer, and she's impressed with what she
% sees.  Smitten, Homer runs toward Marge.  As he gets closer, Marge
% realizes Homer's not a six-foot man standing at the edge of the
% field, but a sixty-foot man standing a quarter-mile away.  She
% starts to flee, but Homer catches her and is able to assure her that
% he won't smoosh her.
%
% He uses Marge's brushy hair for a cotton swab, as a prelude to
% sprucing up for a date.  On the date itself, Homer suspends a swing
% from his forefinger.  He blows gently on Marge to push her to and
% fro on the swing.  He opens up the museum of stuffed animals to
% shower Marge with teddy bears (and a surprised guard).  Finally,
% Homer twists a hoop from a barrel, shines it up, and offers it to
% Marge as a ring.  It's far too big for her hand, of course, but it
% does loop nicely around her waist.
%
% This relationship, like all others, has its own unique challenges.

Homer:	We've been together a long time, now.  When are we gonna 
	... you know?
Marge:	Soon.  I just need a few more yoga classes.
-- "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% Marge notices a shooting star in the night sky.  The nearby
% townspeople see it, too.

		the fire and the impact and the 100% chance of pain!  
		Pain in the glaven!
Lovejoy:	God has sent us this fiery kill-rock to show us his 
		love.
		[the crowd begins to panic]
-- "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% There's only one man who can save the town -- Homer.

Homer:	Oh, I get it.  When I'm crushing and killing you, you 
	don't like me.  But when can save your life, suddenly I'm 
	Mr. Popular.
Lenny:	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Homer:	Woo hoo!  I'm Mr. Popular!
-- "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% The plan is for Homer to bat the meteor away, like a baseball, with
% a bat made out of a giant log.

C'mon, right across the plate!  Let's see what you got, huh!  This 
one's for the little crippled boy ... that I crippled.
-- Homer Simpson (as Paul Bunyan), "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% As Homer bends to get a good-luck kiss from Marge, the meteor lands
% right in his pants.  Homer manages to get the blazing rock out of
% his knickers, hot-potatoes it from one hand to the other for a few
% seconds, and hurls it far away.  It lands on a large city, setting
% it afire.  The crowd cheers.
%
% Back to the train.

Hobo:	And that's how Paul Bunyan started the great Chicago fire.
Bart:	Boy, that story had everything:  A giant!  House-crushing!  
	A meteor!
Marge:	Townspeople!
Lisa:	Got any more tall tales?
Hobo:	Well, I suppose I could spin you up a few more yarns.  But 
	first, who wants to give me a sponge bath?  I'm filthy.
	[the Simpsons look at one another for a couple seconds]
Homer:	All right, but your next story better be worth it.

% After the sponge bath, the hobo continues entertaining the family.

	It's the tale of Johnny -- no, Connie Appleseed.
Lisa:	Ohh ... [flattered smile]
	[dissolve to Pioneer-era America]
Hobo:	Back around 1840, the great pie known as America was still

	Cleaning my gun with the -- [the gun fires, killing a 
	buffalo]  Whoopsie!  [laughs]
Lisa:	Dad!  You just killed a poor, defenseless buffalo.
Homer:	A poor *delicious* buffalo.  He'll be dinner for the whole 
	wagon train.  [shoots a second buffalo]
Lisa:	Why'd you kill another one?
Homer:	Dessert.
-- Why else?  "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% The wagon train chows down that night to a big meal of tasty
% buffalo.  There's a bullet in Bart's meat, and he spits it
% offscreen.  We hear the sound of a buffalo getting hit and dying. 
% Lisa warns the people that if they continue to kill buffalo at this
% pace, they will wipe out the entire species.  Everyone laughs at
% this -- even the buffalo.
%
% Later, while walking among a field of buffalo carcasses, Lisa thinks
% over the situation.

Why is it that we have ladders that can put a man on the roof, but we 
can't find a renewable source of food?
-- Lisa Simpson (as Connie Appleseed), "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% Lisa hears her name in the wind.  (Well, Connie does, anyway.)  It
% draws her to an apple tree standing alone on the prairie.  Looking
% up, Lisa is inspired -- instead of buffalo, the pioneers can base
% their diet on apples!  Excited, she gathers some and takes them to
% the wagon train party.  The camera pans past the tree so we can see
% that the mysterious voice is really coming Hans Moleman, who is
% trapped in some sort of mud or quicksand pit.  He slips beneath the
% surface.

Lisa:	Mom!  Dad!  Look what I found!
Homer:	Oh, boy!  Buffalo testicles!  [takes two apples and starts 
	eating them] Mmmm ...
Lisa:	No, Dad, they're apples.
Homer:	Wha?  [spits the half-chewed apples] Yuch!
Lisa:	Well, that's it.  I don't want anything to do with this 
	wagon train of death.  Either switch to apples, or go on 
	without me.  Hmph!  [closes her eyes.  There's some 
	commotion, and Lisa opens her eyes to see that the wagon 
	train has hastily left without her]
	You'll be sorry!  [throws an apple at the wagon train.  
	Offscreen, a buffalo is hit and dies]
	Oh ...
-- The buffalo's best friend, "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% The hobo says that Connie traveled across the nation, planting apple
% trees, and even changed her last name to "Appleseed."  A little
% Connie icon on an old map traces her route, showing apple trees
% popping up in her wake.  Meanwhile her family changes their surname
% to "Bufflekill."  The map shows their parallel route across the
% Great Plains, with little buffalo skulls in its wake.
%
% One morning on the wagon train path, Homer crawls out of his
% sleeping bag (made of buffalo hide).  He's hungry.

Homer:	[yawns] I haven't had buffalo in six hours.  Marge, how 
	about whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, 
	and some fresh-squeezed buffalo J.
Marge:	The buffalo are gone.  I think you shot them all.
	[the camera pans across the site of a great buffalo 
	slaughter, nothing but bones and skin remains]
Homer:	Oh, Connie was right!  We wiped out the entire species!  
	What have I done?  What have I done?
Bart:	Calm down, Pa.  There's two left.  [points]
Homer:	[shoots them both, then throws down his rifle]

% With no source of food and cold weather arriving, things look grim

		Homer]
Lisa:		Stop, everybody!  I've got apples!  Delicious, 
		nutritious apples!  And, there's enough for

% Back to the modern-day train.

Hobo:	And thanks to that little girl, today you can find apples

% The train crosses the Mississippi River.

Hobo:	Whoa, look out there, folks.  That's the mighty

Homer:	Big deal.
Hobo:	Reminds me of a tall tale about two scalawags rafting down 
	the Big Muddy -- Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.
Lisa:	That's not a tall tale, it's a book by Mark Twain.
Hobo:	Look, let's just do this thing.
-- "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% The story begins with the classic scene of Tom and Huck whitewashing
% a fence.

Nelson:		Whitewashing sucks, Tom.  It powerful sucks.
		[Milhouse walks by, rolling a hoop]
Bart:		Morning, friend.  Want your turn at whitewashing?  
		It's powerful fun.
Milhouse:	Why, you ain't fooling me again, Tom Sawyer.
Nelson:		If I may?  [dunks Milhouse's head in the whitewash] 
		Now, get to work!
		[later, a row of boys -- all with whitewashed faces 
		-- paints the fence]
Bart:		[laughs] I still got it.
-- He's powerful persuasive, "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% Nelson walks on his hands along the top of the fence.

Lisa:	Now, Huckleberry Finn!  You get down from there.  A body 
	could break his neck.
Nelson:	I ain't afeard of that.  I'll just get a new neck, off'n a 
	cat.
-- "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% Sure enough, Nelson falls and gives his bones an "awful rattlin',"
% as Lisa puts it.  As Lisa comforts him, the two start holding hands. 
% Homer catches them at it, and is powerful mad.  Nelson says that he
% was going to let go eventually, and Homer seems okay with it.  Just
% to play it safe, though ...
%
% Cut to the church.  Nelson and Lisa are at the altar, and Homer has
% a shotgun trained on Nelson.

Lovejoy:	We are gathered here today to force this man, 
		Huckleberry Finn, to holy matrimony.
Marge:		[to Homer] How romantic.  This reminds me of our 
		shotgun wedding.
		[we hear the sound of a shotgun cocking.  The camera 
		reveals that Abe is pointing a gun at Marge]
		Grandpa, we've been married for years.  When are you 
		going to put down that gun?
Abe:		Well, I reckon you're right.  [he lowers the gun, 
		and Marge immediately runs away]
		Hang it all!
-- "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% The ceremony begins.

Lovejoy:	Do you, Huck, take Becky as your wife ...
		[suddenly, Huck squeals]
		Whoa!  [Lovejoy takes off Huck's hat, and sees that 
		it's really a pig in a tuxedo]
Abe:		Hey, they done switched the groom with a pig!
Homer:		No wonder he was pooping so much!
-- "Simpsons Tall Tales"

% Tom Sawyer and the real Huck laugh at the wedding party and run
% away.  The parishioners chase after them, leaving the pig behind to
% eat the wedding cake.  The boys make it to a raft and slowly make
% their getaway down the river.
%
% A little bit later, the boys make it across the state line, leaving
% Missouri and entering Missourah.  Their sense of relief doesn't last
% long.  Soon the raft takes a wild ride through the rapids and down a
% waterfall.  Afterwards, it lands at a dock.

Announcer:	Please do not exit the raft until it has come to a 
		complete stop.
		[the raft stops and the boys disembark.  The boys 
		walk past a wall of photographs that were taken of 
		other people riding the rapids]
Man:		Mr. Silas, this young lady's flashing her privates.

		tucks it into his jacket]
		[salaciously] All for Silas, all for Silas ...

% The boys leave with their purchases as Apu says, "Thank you, come
% again."  Bart holds up a leaking bag and complains that Apu has put

% bigger problems.  Wanted posters are up for both of them -- Nelson
% for marriage-dodging and Bart for "moonshining" (the latter showing
% Bart in the act of mooning the viewer).  Even worse, a wedding posse
% has tracked them down.  The boys grab the "Wanted" signs, run to the
% river, and try to use them to paddle their raft to freedom.  They
% work furiously, but their pursuers are catching up.
%
% A riverboat passes by, and Bart gets an idea.  The posse rounds a
% bend in the river, but the boys aren't there.  "Dog my cats," Homer
% says, "they's dis-separated."  Not quite.  Bart and Nelson are
% really hanging from the balcony on the riverboat.  They float by
% within sight of the posse, but as long as nothing draws peoples'

% Just then, Riverboat Captain appears on the balcony, and gives a
% virtuoso performance of "Old Man River."  At the finale, he leaps
% onto the balcony rail, stepping on the boys' hands.  The boys lose
