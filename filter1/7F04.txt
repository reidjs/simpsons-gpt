% On a stage, Marge pops out from behind a curtain.

Hello everyone.  You know, Hallowe'en is a very strange holiday.  Personally,
I don't understand it.  Mm mm...  Kids worshipping ghosts, pretending to be
devils.  Oooh, things on TV that are <completely> inappropriate for younger
viewers.  Things like the following half hour.  Nothing seems to bother <my>
kids. But tonight's show, which I totally wash my hands of, is really scary.
So if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed
early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow.  Thanks for
your attention.

% ``The Simpsons Halloween Special''.  Thunderstorm.  Pan across Springfield
% Cemetery...  Push in on the Simpsons' home, panning upward to the treehouse,
% where Lisa's distinctive hairstyle can be seen in the window.  Down below,
% a sheeted ghost approaches.  It's Homer, carrying a bag of treats.

Ooh, what a haul this year.  I <love> Hallowe'en!

% He spots the light on in the treehouse and investigates.

% Inside, Lisa holds a flashlight to her face and concludes telling her
% scary story to Bart and Maggie.  Bart is hardly impressed and says it
% wasn't scary.  After a brief ``Is not!''/``Is too!'' argument, Lisa
% hands Bart the flashlight and tells him to give it his best shot.
% ``Here's a story that's reeeeeeeeeeeeally scarifying.''  (``Oh, brother.'')
