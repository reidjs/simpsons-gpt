        Bart: Hey, Dad, how come you've never taken us to see a soccer game?
       Homer: I...don't know.
TV Announcer: You'll see all your favorite soccer stars.  Like Ariaga! 
              Ariaga II!  Bariaga!  Aruglia!  And Pizzoza!
       Homer: Oh, I never heard of those people.
TV Announcer: And they'll all be signing autographs!
       Homer: Woo-hoo!
TV Announcer: This match will determine once and for all which nation is 
              the greatest on earth: Mexico or Portugal!

Marge: Oh, my God.  Homer, they're right next door.

Salesman: Intruders could come in down the chimney, through the mail slot,
          even hidden in your groceries.
-- Gasp! "The Cartridge Family"

% Marge eyes a sack of groceries in the kitchen suspiciously.

Salesman: Did you change the locks when you moved in?  Eh, I thought not.
          All the previous owners of this house could still be in here 
          somewhere.
   Marge: What do you recommend?
Salesman: Well, a lot of companies would put in a pretty system that looks
          good, but doesn't provide any real protection.
   Homer: Oh, let's get that!
Salesman: But if you really want to sleep easy at night I'd recommend
          sealing off every door and window with bullet-proof lucite.
   Marge: Wouldn't we all suffocate?
Salesman: [laughs] Well, I should hope not!
   Homer: Let's get that, the suffocation thing.
Salesman: And you can have it all for just five hundred dollars.
   Homer: Five hundred dollars?!  Aw, forget it.
-- "The Cartridge Family"

% Pushing the salesman out the front door, Homer hears his final case.

Salesman: But surely you can't put a price on your family's lives.
   Homer: I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are.
-- God, he loves them so, "The Cartridge Family"

% Homer shuts the door behind him, where Marge stands worriedly.

% End of act one.

% Act two.  In the gun shop, Homer practices handling an unloaded handgun.
% Pointing it at the store owner's head, he pulls the trigger several times.

Gun Shop Owner: Woah, careful there, Annie Oakley. [takes gun]
         Homer: I don't have to be careful.  I got a gun.
-- At the gun store, "The Cartridge Family"

Gun Shop Owner: Speed-cocker.

Gun Shop Owner: And this is for shooting down police helicopters.

                Just give me my gun. [grabs for gun]
-- "The Cartridge Family"

Gun Shop Owner: Sorry, the law requires a five-day waiting period.  We've

-- "The Cartridge Family"

% The owner finally pulls the gun away from Homer.

         Homer: I'd kill you if I had my gun!
Gun Shop Owner: Yeah, well, you don't.
         Homer: [walking out of store to his car] Lousy big shot, thinks

-- Homer being his annoying self, "The Cartridge Family"

% The next day, Homer sits in his front yard in a lawn chair wondering how

% Petty's "Waiting Is The Hardest Part", he watches as a Target Superstores 
% truck, his sisters-in-law on a bicycle, a row of ducks, and Ned Flanders
% on a riding lawnmower pass by, each escaping without a shot fired in their
% direction.  Finally, the days pass, and he waits impatiently outside the
% Gun Shop as the owner unlocks the door.  Running inside, he runs into the
% men's room, flushes, and walks calmly to the front counter.

         Homer: Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me.
Gun Shop Owner: Well, let's see here.  According to your background check,
                you've been in a mental institution...
         Homer: Yeah.
Gun Shop Owner: ...frequent problems with alcohol...
         Homer: [laughs nervously] Yeah.
Gun Shop Owner: ...beat up President Bush!
         Homer: Former President Bush.

Marge: Mmm! [closes eyes]
Homer: Okay...open your eyes.

%We see it from Marge's perspective: her eyelids open, revealing Homer
% pointing the barrel of his gun at her face.  She screams.

Hey!  It's a handgun!  Isn't it great?  This is the trigger, this is the
thing you point at whatever you want to die...
-- It's the best thing a wife could have wanted! "The Cartridge Family"

Marge: [hands in the air] Homer!  I don't want guns in my house!  Don't you
       remember when Maggie shot Mr. Burns?
Homer: I thought Smithers did it.
 Lisa: That would've made a lot more sense...
-- Ah, memories, "The Cartridge Family"

 Bart: Hey Dad, can I borrow the gun tommorrow?  I want to scare that old
       security guard at the bank.
Homer: Only if you clean your room.
-- "The Cartridge Family"

Marge: Mmm!  No! [pulls gun from Homer] No one's using this gun!  The TV
       said you're fifty-eight percent more likely to shoot a family member
       than an intruder!
Homer: TV said that...?  But I have to have a gun!  It's in the Constitution!
 Lisa: Dad!  The Second Amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days.
       It has no meaning today!
Homer: You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa.  If I didn't have this gun, the 
       King of England could just walk in here any time he wants, and start
       shoving you around. [pushing Lisa] Do you want that? [pushing her
       harder] Huh?  Do you?
 Lisa: [quietly indignant] No...
Homer: All right, then.
Marge: I'm sorry, Homer.  No weapons.
-- "The Cartridge Family"

A gun is not a weapon, Marge.  It's a tool.  Like a butcher knife, or a
harpoon, or...uh, a...an alligator.  You just need more education on the
subject.  Tell you what.  You come with me to an N.R.A. meeting, and if you
still don't think guns are great...we can argue some more.
-- Homer laying down the sweet talk, "The Cartridge Family"

% Walking to a local N.R.A. meeting, Homer and Marge arrives at the entrance,
% where Lou and Eddie monitor the metal detector.  Moe, Krusty, and Rainier
% Wolfcastle each pass through, setting off a red light on top.  When Kearney
% walks through without setting it off, Eddie sends him back through, where
% Lou hands him a pistol.  He carries it through, this time setting it off.

% Inside, Lenny, M-16 in hand, talks to the audience from a podium.

Lenny: Assault weapons have gotten a lot of bad press lately, but they're

% After the N.R.A. gathering shares a laugh with Moe, Homer stands up.

Homer: Hi, I'm Homer S.
Crowd: Hi, Homer!
Homer: Hi.  It seems if a gun can protect something as important as a bar,
       it's good enough to protect my family.  So if you'll have me, I'd
       like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization.
-- [sniff] "The Cartridge Family"

% The association cheers wildly.  Marge grabs Homer by the shirt and

Homer: Oh, come on, be fair, Marge!  For once in your life, be fair!
Marge: Oh...
-- "The Cartridge Family"

% At an indoor firing range, several N.R.A. members practice shooting.  
% Homer takes aim and shoots a row of cans, which turn out to be on the 
% counter of the snack bar.  Later, at the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer walks in, 
% twirling his pistol on his finger.

  Apu: Oh!  Don't shoot!  Just take the money and get out!

       ground] You want me to get the cat down?
 Lisa: [quickly] No thanks!

% In the backyard, Homer shoots dinner plate clay pigeons, tossed into the

% out of various alternative dishes, such as a pots, a cookie sheet, and a
% strainer.  Marge stares at her glass of food.

Marge: Does anyone know where all my dinner plates went?

-- Long distance conversation, "The Cartridge Family"

% Inside the motel room, Homer sits with Marge on the bed.

Homer: Oh, honey, please come home.  I need you!  It's dark in the house
       and I'm hungry and lonesome and there's no one there to hear my
       various witty remarks!
Marge: What about the gun?
Homer: It's gone for good, Marge.  I finally realized, what's the point of
       having a gun for protection, if you've got no one to protect?
Marge: Oh, Homey... [they hug] Come on, kids, we're going home!
-- "The Cartridge Family"

% The kids roll by on the vibrating bed, cheering.  Down at the front
% desk, the Simpsons check out while Mayor Quimby gets a bucket of ice.
% Suddenly, Snake bursts into the room and holds a knife to the mayor's neck.

 Snake: Right, everybody, hands up.  You!  Give me the cash drawer.
Quimby: Do what he says, I'm too rich to die!
 Homer: [whipping out gun] Freeze, bad guy!
-- Oh Homer... "The Cartridge Family"

% Snake drops his knife and lets the mayor escape ("Vote Quimby!").  Homer
% holds him at gunpoint.

Snake: Okay, man.  Don't shoot, chill.
Marge: Homer!  You said you got rid of the gun!  You lied to me!  Again!
Homer: [facing Marge] I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was...
Snake: [grabbing the gun] Yoink!  Ho, ho!  Ha-ha, ha!
Homer: The joke's on you, buddy.  There's no bullets in that thing!
       [Homer laughs and jiggles a box of bullets.]
Snake: Yo!  Give me the bullets!
Homer: Okay!  Don't shoot!
-- "The Cartridge Family"

% As Snake begins to load the weapon, Moe, Agnes, Lenny, and Dr. Hibbert 
% appear in the doorway, pointing guns at Snake.  They yell, in unison, "Drop 
% it!".  Snake drops the gun and stares for a moment, takes the money from 
% the motel employee, yells "Bye!", and runs out the door.

Marge: How did you know we were being robbed?
Lenny: The clerk here pressed the silent alarm, and we picked it up on
       our scanners.
 Lisa: Did anyone stop that robber?
  Moe: No, I don't think so.
-- "The Cartridge Family"

% Homer picks his gun up off the floor and looks humble for Marge.

I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge.  But this gun had a hold on me.  I felt this
incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun.  So
please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!
-- Homer, "The Cartridge Family"

% Homer hands his wife the gun, picks Maggie up, and leads the kids outside.
% Marge, holding the gun by the barrel, steps on the lid pedal of a nearby 
% trash can, and is about to throw it in, when she sees her reflection in the 
% lid.  Posing briefly with the gun, she twirls it quickly on her finger and
% smiles, admiring her appearance.  Closing the lid, she drops the weapon into
% her purse and walks out of the motel, closing the door behind her.

% End of act three.
