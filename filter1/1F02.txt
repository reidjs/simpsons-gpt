% It's another lazy day at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.  Homer
% sits snoring at his desk, his old, faithful dog snoozing in a chair
% next to him.  Lenny has craftily constructed a hammock for himself in
% another room.
%
% In his sleep, Homer rests his head on the control panel in front of
% him -- directly on the "PLANT DESTRUCT: PLEASE DO NOT PUSH" button.
% The control room becomes awash in the red glow of emergency lights,
% and the automated female voice says, "Core meltdown in ten seconds...
% nine..." Homer's dog wakes up, hears the voice, and pulls the reset
% lever with his mouth.  The voice announces, "Meltdown averted...good
% boy."
%
% Mr. Burns, too, is asleep in his chair, its back to his wall of
% monitors.  Yes, even the people on the monitors are asleep too.
% Smithers sleeps, curled up beside Burns' chair.  His leg twitches, and
% he moans softly in his sleep.
%
% Outside, in the parking lot, the Nuclear Inspection Van recreational
% vehicle pulls up.  Three white hard-hatted, lab-jacketed inspectors
% jump out and press the buzzer at the entrance to the plant.

Agent 1: [presses the buzzer]
  Burns: [awakening, over the intercom] Mmm...hmm...what?  How dare you
         disturb me during nap time.
Agent 1: We're from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  This is a
         surprise test of worker competence.
  Burns: There must be some mistake.  We, er, we make cookies here: Mr.
         Burns' Olde-Fashioned Good-Time Extra-Chewy --
Agent 2: [to Agent 3] Get the axe.
-- We've done this before, "Homer Goes to College"

% Smithers and Burns watch from the window as the inspectors lead some
% plant employees into their vehicle.

   Burns: The watchdog of public safety...is there any lower form of
          life?
Smithers: Don't worry sir, I rounded up our less gifted employees and
          led them into the basement.
           [Shot of the basement with Homer and two other guys]
  Bernie: Duh, Homer, why are we down here?
   Homer: Aw, geez.  I told you, Bernie: to guard the bee!
     Man: [whining] But why?
   Homer: Aw, you guys are pathetic.  No wonder Smithers made me head
          bee-guy.
           [Homer kicks the jar accidentally, smashing it, and the bee
          escapes]
  Bernie: Duh, he's gettin' away.
     Man: Oh, we did bad!
-- No recess for you, "Homer Goes to College"

% The inspectors want to test Homer's competence next, but Smithers
% apologizes for him, saying, "He couldn't _bee_ here."  Burns fobs them
% off with some excuse about Homer chairing a conference on nuclear
% fission in Geneva.  Unfortunately, Homer jumps up through a manhole
% cover just then, exclaiming, "The bee bit my bottom!  Now my bottom's
% big!"
%
% The inspectors put Homer in the van.

Agent 2: Homer, this is an exact replica of your work station.
  Homer: [moans]
Agent 2: Now we're going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight.
  Homer: What the hell are you talking about?
-- This won't look good on a resume, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer is despondent.

  Homer: What do I do?  What do I do?  In the name of God you've got to
         tell me!  [sobbing]
Agent 2: Relax, it's just a simulator.  Nothing can go wrong.
  Homer: [sotto voce] Just poke blindly at the controls until they let
         you go.
-- It's worked before, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer begins doing just that, but something goes horribly wrong.
% "This can't be happening!" exclaims one of the inspectors, as the van
% begins to glow green and sink into the ground.  Panic ensues at the
% plant.  Burns decides to try to get away in his escape pod.  He
% activates the entrance to the pod, jumps in, and slams the door shut.
% Smithers implores, "For the love of God, sir, there are two seats!"
% but Burns likes to put his feet up.  The pod takes off, but doesn't
% even come close to reaching escape velocity.  Instead, it crashes into
% the street and continues bouncing down it in a crumpled ball.
%
% A glowing green Homer rises out of the hole left where the van used to
% be, growling and fearsome.  "Must destroy mankind," he intones, but
% the alarm on his watch goes off, reminding him that it's lunch time.
% He shakes off his radioactivity and bounds off to eat.
%
% The agents watch the detox team spray the hole in the parking lot with
% a foamy sealant.

Agent 2: I'm still not sure how he caused the meltdown.  There wasn't
         any nuclear material in the truck!
  Burns: Oh, very well, it's time for your bribe.
         Now, you can either have the washer and dryer where the lovely
         Smithers is standing, or you can trade it all in for what's in
         this box.
-- I can't decide, Monty, "Homer Goes to College"

% One inspector wants the box, but the other inspector remembers her
% ethics.  She explains that Burns can't make the problem go away just
% by throwing money at it, but just then, Mayor Quimby walks by in a fur
% coat labeled "$5000" saying that he he's decided there will be no
% investigation.  He then leaves.
%
% The inspectors tell Burns that Homer's job requires college training
% in nuclear physics.  If he doesn't get Homer up to speed, they tell
% him, they'll be forced to take legal action.  "Is that so?" asks
% Burns.  "I have the feeling you'll be dropping the charges," he says,
% emphasizing "dropping" as he pushes a red button on his desk.  A trap
% door springs open, but it's nowhere near where the inspectors are
% standing.  "The painters moved your desk," Smithers reminds him.
%
% The doorbell rings at the Simpsons house, and Homer goes to answer it.

 Homer: [answers the door, sees Burns with his lawyers] Aah!
 Burns: Hello, Simpson.  My lawyers and I were in the neighborhood and
        thought we'd stop by.
 Marge: [nervously] Would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow
        squares?
         [The lawyers discuss it quietly amongst themselves]
Lawyer: Yes, he would.
-- Executive decision, "Homer Goes to College"

% At the table, Homer asks Burns to confirm that he must go to college.
% Bart scoffs, asking Homer, "College?  Barber or Clown?"

   Burns: Remember, your job and the future of your family hinges on
          your successful completion of Nuclear Physics 101.
          Oh, and one more thing: [ominously] you must find the jade
          monkey before the next full moon.
Smithers: Actually sir, we found the jade monkey; it was in your glove
          compartment.
   Burns: And the road maps?  And ice scraper?
Smithers: They were in there too, sir.
   Burns: Ex-cellent!  It's all falling into place.

Nerd 2: OK, guys: push him out of the way in exactly three seconds.
Nerd 1: Should we correct for wind resistance?
Nerd 3: Hmm, possibly.  What do _you_ think?
         [Homer hits the Dean with his car, and the Dean goes flying]
Nerd 1: Oh, my.
-- I hope he's insured, "Homer Goes to College"

% In the Springfield General Hospital, Homer and the nerds stand beside
% the Dean's bed.  Homer apologizes for the "running-you-over prank",
% and he admits that all the other pranks were his idea too.  "I'm the
% one who should be expelled."  The Dean is touched by Homer's honesty,
% and he wonders if perhaps he's been a bit of an ogre himself.  "Yes
% you have," Homer confirms quietly.
%
% The Dean magnanimously offers to readmit the nerds and to forget that
% the whole silly incident ever happened.  Just then, Dr. Hibbert walks
% in with the Dean's prosthetic replacement hip.  It breaks in his
% hands, so the Doctor jovially informs him he'll have to go easy on it.
%
% The nerds move back into room 222, and check their answering machine.
% "Number of messages received: zero," it says, and the three sigh with
% relief.  They thank Homer for getting them back into college, and he
% says, "The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends."
%
% But Homer has forgotten why he was at college in the first place: "So,
% in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow's big final exam," says the
% Nuclear Physics 101 lecturer.  "Exam?!  This is just like one of those
% bad dreams," Homer says from his seat in the back row; he then glances
% down, noticing he's wearing only his underwear.

Nerd 2: What are you going to do, Mr. Simpson?
 Homer: Actually, I've been working on a plan.  During the exam, I'll
        hide under some coats, and hope that somehow everything will
        work out.
Nerd 2: [determined] Or, with our help, you can cram like you've never
        crammed before!
 Homer: Whatever.  Either way is good.
-- I'm not picky, "Homer Goes to College"

% Homer goes to the library and takes out a wheelbarrow full of books.
% The nerds tie his eyes open and hold a book in front of him.  He falls
% asleep while reading another book, and one of the nerds slaps him
% lightly on the cheek to wake him.  Reflexively, Homer drives his fist
% into the nerd's unfortunate face, and falls back asleep.
%
% In the exam, Homer is one of the last to leave, but he hands in his
% paper with a smile, clicking his heels joyously.  The instructor
% glances at his answers, and stamps a circled red "F" on his paper.
%
% The nerds are discontented with Homer's performance.

Nerd 2: Oh, man, I can't believe you failed.
 Homer: [whining] Oh, I'm going to lose my job just 'cause I'm
        dangerously unqualified!
Nerd 2: Mr. Simpson, there is a way.  We could -- well, use a computer
        to change your grade.
 Homer: [surprised] Computers can do that?
Nerd 2: Well, yes...the only problem is the moral dilemma it raises,
        which requires --
         [Homer kisses one of the computers]
 Homer: Oh, I love -- moral whuzzah?
-- You know, ethical crisis, "Homer Goes to College"

Marge: An A+!  How did you do it?
Homer: Oh, let's just say I had help from a little magic box.
Marge: You changed your grade with a computer?
Homer: D'oh!
-- How'd she figure that out?, "Homer Goes to College"

% Bart is impressed at Homer's ability, and Homer is quick to redirect
% attention elsewhere.

 Homer: Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson.
        These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside
        college.
Nerd 2: No we didn't.
 Homer: Oh.  Then I learned the real value of college is to study, and
        work hard.
  Lisa: No you didn't.  You only passed your course by cheating, which
        you always taught us was wrong.
 Homer: Hmm...true.
-- The need for Debating 101, "Homer Goes to College"

% Marge wants Homer to take the course over again so he can pass it
% without cheating.  Homer accuses her of being worse than the crusty
% old Dean.  But he sighs, accepting Marge's resolution.

Homer: Well, I guess it's back to college for me.  And that means it's
       time to -- what did I teach you guys?
Nerds: [timidly] Par - ty - down?
Homer: Yess!
-- Woo hoo!, "Homer Goes to College"

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:23]

% "Louie, Louie" plays over the closing credits, as many scenes of
% Homer's return to college flash by.
