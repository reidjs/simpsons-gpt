% Homer and Marge are driving the car through the snowy streets of
% Springfield. Homer struggles with the heater, thumping it violently.

Stupid heater! Don't make me come in there!
-- Homer threatens the car heater, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% arrive at Try-N-Save, and Homer parks in a disabled space, and emerges from
% the car dragging one leg as he walks to stay in character.
% When they get inside, it's so packed that there probably won't be any good
% toys left for the kids by the time they reach the shelves. But Homer has a
% cunning plan. He goes to one of the empty cash registers and announces over
% the intercom that his cash register is open for customers to pay for their
% goods. A rush of people populate around Homer, as he takes the toys people
% have chosen, and puts them aside for himself.

Homer: We're outta these.
Woman: Out, but I jus--
Homer: Register 9 is now closed! [Homer stuffs some cash into the cash
       register and makes a getaway]

Hey kids! I made your favorite cookies! Christmas trees for the girls, and
bloody spearheads for Bart!
-- Marge, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% Bart plays with his cookie, while Lisa admires the tree.

 Lisa: This year's tree is just perfect! That aluminum one was so fake!
Marge: I couldn't agree more! From now on it's plastic all the way! [Marge
       tugs at a stretchy branch, and lets it snap back]
-- "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

      [a noise is heard on the roof]
Lisa: [gasp] What was that?
Bart: Could it be?
      [the kids rush to the window. Some reindeer fall down, followed by
      Homer, who is hanging by his feet on an electric cable, but soon
      falls. The kids are in hysterics!]
-- "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% The family go outside to see the lights Homer put up. They're a big mess.
% A lot worse than in "Some Enchanted Evening".

It's craptacular.
-- Bart on Homer's Christmas lights display, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% The family are around the tree feeling their wrapped presents trying to
% guess what they've got. Maggie's makes a weird noise.

 Bart: Hocus pocus! Mucus puke-us! My powers of deduction tell me you are
       getting a hand-made sweater, possibly... yellow!
 Lisa: Mom, make him stop!
Marge: Bart, put down that yellow sweater!
-- Yeah, you're ruining the surprise! "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% Marge tells the family to get away from their presents. Nobody is to go
% near them until seven o'clock in the morning. And just to make sure,
% Marge has every alarm clock in the house in her possession.

Marge: For once we're going to celebrate Christmas as a family!

  Abe: [hopeful] Hello? Anybody home?

-- Bart praying on Christmas eve, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% Bart stumps his elbow on the corner of his drawers (ouch!), and dives onto
% it.

% That night, the tap drips, and Bart has a mysterious dream. He drops out
% of the tap and is washed down the plug hole of the bathroom sink. He
% comes out of a tunnel on a raft, surrounded by water and water-related
% things. It wakes up up, needing to go to the bathroom. But it worked. It's
% 5:04 AM, and nobody else is awake. After visiting the toilet, Bart sneaks
% downstairs. Bart opens his present. It's a toy fire truck that squirts
% water and drives around at the touch of a controller.

[gasp] The Inferno Buster 3000! Oh, I knew Santa wouldn't have time to check
that list twice!
-- Bart gets what he wants, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% Bart tests his new toy, and accidentally makes it squirt water onto the
% mains. The toy catches fire from the reaction, and drives into the tree
% without Bart stopping it! The tree catches fire, and Bart rushes to get
% a hose, which doesn't quite reach far enough to extinguish the flames.

[groan] Who designed this house?!
-- Bart tries to put out a fire with a hose that doesn't quite reach,
"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% The plastic tree melts to the ground. Meanwhile, Homer and Marge lie in
% bed. Marge is awoken.

Marge: Homer, I think I heard a noise!
       [Homer, still asleep, makes a groggy noise similar to the one Marge
       heard. She sighs in relief, and goes back to sleep, breathing quietly.]
Homer: Knock it off!
-- "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% Bart drags the melted (now flat) tree into the front garden and shovels
% snow onto it, concealing it! Bart runs back as the sun rises, and the
% family are about to get a shock.

Where's Christmas? Lisa! Where's Christmas...?
-- Homer can't see the Christmas tree, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% Bart lies, claiming a burglar took the tree and everyone's presents. He
% puts on one of his great crying shows.

[crying] Can... we... skip... ...church?
-- Homer, when the family's Christmas gifts are apparently stolen, "Miracle
on Evergreen Terrace"

% Soon enough, the police are investigating.

Chief Wiggum: Now, um, what did this Christmas thief look like?
        Bart: Well, he had a glass eye, a wooden leg, a big scar on his cheek.
Chief Wiggum: Anything unusual?
-- "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% Bart adds that he had a striped shirt, was an escaped convict, and had a
% sack with a dollar sign on it. The police leave.

Well, theres no easy way to say it, kids... God hates us!
-- Homer, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

Hey, since when is Christmas just about presents? Aren't we forgetting the
true meaning of this day -- the birth of Santa?
-- Bart, Sunday School Skiver, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

 Lisa: Hey, why don't we walk over to Grampa's and cheer up the old folks?
       That'll make us feel better!
Homer: [moan] Okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me
       happy!
-- "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% The family are on their way, and pass the Flanders home, inside of which
% the family appear to be having one hell of a time. Homer gets the family

I'm Kent Brockman. I'm here at the scene of the Christmas burglary, where
a creature <was> stirring last night, and what he was stirring was "up
trouble."
-- Kent Brockman, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"

% Kent speaks to Marge.

Kent Brockman: So when you realized Christmas was ruin, how did you feel?
