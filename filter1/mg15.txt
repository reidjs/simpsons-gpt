% The Simpsons living room.  Over the couch is a picture
% of an ocean liner.  Homer and Bart.  In Homer's left hand is a plate
% heaped with green goop.  A plate of orange goop is in his right hand.

H: Hey there, boy.  Mom took the girls to the `ballet' tonight, so
   it's just you and me, kid.

% Homer says the word `ballet' in a `la dee da' teasing manner.

B: [not enthusiastic]  Uh, sure, Dad.
H: So set up the TV trays and let's get started.
   You want the frozen fish nuggets [the orange goop]
   or pork-a-roni! [the green glop]

% Bart's cheeks puff out in mock vomit.

B: [still not enthusiastic] Well, it's a toss-up, Dad.
H: I've got an idea!
   Let's mix them together smorgasborg [sic] style!

% Homer upends the plate of green goop atop the plate of orange goop
% and mushes the two plates like an accordion.  After a few compressions,
% the glop has turned a uniform purple color.

H: Voila!  Fish pork-a-roni a la Simpson.

% Bart raises his hand.

B: Uh, Dad?  Is it too late for me to catch a bus to the ballet?

%
% The picture over the couch is of the ocean liner nearing a mine floating
% in the water.  (You know, the round spikey things.)
%
% Homer stands where he was before, carrying a plate of steaming-hot
% purple/pink glop.  The two TV trays are set up in front of the couch,
% but Bart is nowhere to be seen.

H: Where'd he go?  Bart?  Bart?  Bart...

% Homer's calling becomes short and clipped.

H: Bart!  Bart!  Bart-Bart!

% Bart's head rises from behind the couch.

H: Baaart!
B: Here I am.

% Bart climbs over the couch.  Homer has an angry expression.

H: Eat.

% Homer tosses the plate of purple/pink glop (a ten-inch high pile)
% on the TV tray in front of Bart (*splort*), who has sat down.  The glop
% jiggles as it lands.  Bart pokes his finger at it and tastes his finger.

B: Yech.  Tastes like dog food.
H: Bart!

% Bart holds a forkful of steaming hot purple/pink glop.

B: Does eating dog food turn you into a dog?

% Homer barks back.

H: Bart!
B: Well, that answers that question.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:55]
%
% The ship is going down in flames.  Homer and Bart are seated facing each
% other, eating off the TV trays.  Both have a huge pile of purple/pink
% glop.  Homer's mouth is demonstrably full of glop, which he swallows.
% Homer shakes his forkful of glop at Bart.  (Little gloplets fly off.)
% The area around Homer's plate is spattered with glop.  Bart hasn't
% touched his food.  He just sits there, fork in hand, staring at the food.

H: [scolding] You're not touching your fish pork nuggets-a-roni, boy.

% The fork flies out of Homer's hand.

H: [brightly] Whoops!  Dropped my fork!

% While Homer bends down to pick up his fork, Bart dumps his food on
% Homer's plate.  (*splort*)  When Homer gets back up, Bart sits in
% his chair with an innocent smile, staring at the ceiling.  Homer
% is somewhat astounded.

H: Finished already?

% Bart holds his very clean plate.

B: Mmmm.  Licked the plate clean.

% Homer reaches down and produces a saucepan of, yes, more purple/pink glop.
% Bart reacts accordingly.

H: Good!  Cause there's plenty more where that came from!

% Homer forks a huge dollop of glop onto Bart's plate.  Bart's cheeks
% puff out.

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 1:17]
%
% The foyer.  Marge and the girls return home.  Lisa and Maggie ballet-dance
% on tip-toes off stage right.  (Maggie falls just as she leaves.)

M: We're home!  The ballet was divine!  Oh, it was just...
   [sniffs]  What's that smell?

% She spots Homer and Bart, asleep on the couch, the remnants of a
% fish-a-roni pork nuggets-a-thon on the TV trays.  The painting depicts
% a bubbling ocean (glug glug) and some flotsam.

M: [adorably]  Oh, look at that.  Our own two husky men snuggled
   together on the couch.

% Bart moans.
%
% Close-up on Homer's face.  He talks and gesticulates in his sleep.

H: Pass that bucket of [smacks his lips] fish pork nuggets-a-roni this way.

% Bart, meanwhile, waves his arms in front of him.  He is apparently
% having a nightmare.

B: Come on, man.  No nuggified fish porklets.  Ohhhh noooooo....

M: Isn't that sweet...
