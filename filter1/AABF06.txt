           Moments from now, the house that Social Security checks
           built will be demolished to make way for a casino-themed
           family hotel!
Burns:     [watching from behind a police line, wipes away a tear]
Smithers:  This must be heartbreaking for you, sir.
Burns:     I'm just thinking of my employees.  Oh, the card sharks,
           bottom dealers, and shills.  Where will they go?
Smithers:  They're managing your chain of nursing homes, sir.
Burns:     Excellent.

% Kent continues his report; we get a better look at the boarded up,

Lisa:     I'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the
          town.
Homer:    Oh, I can explain that.  You see ...

% Homer's explanation, however, is interrupted by the countdown.

Homer:    Really?  Think I should get it washed?
Lenny:    Yeah, maybe.

Ned:      Well, I did, but ...
Homer:    Now I'm not a fancy big city lawyer, [congregation gasps] but

Ginger:   You two fellas are the nicest husbands we've ever had.  And
          we're not giving you up without a fight.
Homer:    But Ginger, honey, I am not the catch I appear to be.
Ned:      Ginger's my wife!
Homer:    Are you sure?  Oh, rats.  No offense, sweetie.
Ned:      Homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelets?
Homer:    Geez, I've never seen anyone so whipped so fast.  [makes whip
          sound]
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% At the breakfast counter, Ned is has a panic attack while Homer
% gathers some food items onto a tray.

Ned:      What are we gonna do, Homer?  My kids are gonna be
          traumatized!  And then there's Maude!  And then there's
          Maude!!
Homer:    I don't know, Flanders, having two wives could have its
          advantages.
          [Homer's imagination conjures up himself lying in a hammock
          while Marge and the cocktail waitress chop wood and dig a
          hole, respectively]
Homer:    Chop, chop, dig, dig, chop, chop, dig, dig, chop, chop, dig,
          dig ...
Marge:    You know, Homey, there's so much more two wives could do for
          you ...
Homer:    I hear digging, but I don't hear chopping!
-- Um, yeah ... they could bring you a beer and a lemonade,
   "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Just then, in his dream, a bee flies by.  "Ooh!  A friendly bee!" he
% says, until it sits on his nose and stings him, making him scream.
% Back at the casino, Homer holds his nose.

Homer:    Ow!  That sting hurts so much!  We gotta get out of this,
          Ned.
Ned:      Well do something.  This is all your fault.  You and your
          stupid program!
Homer:    Blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the
          Program!  The Program is rock solid!  The Program is sound!
Ginger:   Yoo hoo!
Homer:    Oh, those awful women want their omelets.
Ned:      Oh, how are we gonna get out of this mess in an honorable and
          decent ... [sees Homer running off]  Oh ... nuts!  [runs
          after him]
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Back at the table, Ginger is reluctant to eat the fattening omelet.
% Amber advises her to relax, since she's already landed a husband.  Her
% serenity disappears when she notices the guys making a break for it.
%
% To the tune of "Viva Las Vegas", Homer and Ned run from the
% waitresses into the casino and knock over a bunch of slot machines,
% whose engrossed users simply tilt their heads to keep playing.
% Pulling two janitors into a utility room, they attempt to beat them
% up, but things unfortunately end  up the other way around.  Crawling
% away in pain, they encounter their wives  once more and run back into
% the casino, where Gil tries his luck at craps.

Gil:      Come on, baby, show Gil a four!  [rolls dice -- snake eyes]
Dealer:   Craps!
Gil:      Oh, no, why did I bet the company payroll?  Oh, Gil's in a
          lot of trouble.
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Homer and Ned, hiding behind Gil's table, are spotted by both their
% wives and the Security Cameraman.

Amber:         Somebody help!  Our husbands are trying to ditch us!
Security Man:  Someone dishonoring their marriage vows?  Not in Las
               Vegas.  Attention all employees!  We've got two
               runaways.  Stop them!
-- They take marriage seriously in Vegas, "Viva Ned Flanders"

% The two are surrounded by men in black suits, Gunter and Ernst with a
% white tiger, Drederick Tatum, and the Moody Blues, who improvise a
% poem.

Graeme Edge:    Cold-hearted Homer ditching his wife,
                While ancient Ned runs for his life.
Justin Hayward: Chips of red, and blue, and white,
                But we decide, we ...
John Lodge:     Can the poems, it's arse-whipping time.
Ray Thomas:     [pulling out a knife] I want fatty.
-- That wasn't in the liner notes, "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Homer yells; our two heroes soon find themselves cornered.  Homer
% suggests switching wives.  "For the last time," says Flanders with
% some exasperation, "no!"  Eyeing a car on display in the casino, Homer
% figures he and Ned can use it to escape.  He jumps in the convertible
% and yells "So long, suckers."  His pause, however, gives the casino
% employees time to jump on top of the car and pummel the two.  Later,
% Tatum tosses the two past a sign that reads "State Line", into the
% desert next to the highway.

Security Man:  Get out and stay out.  Las Vegas don't care for out-of-
               towners.  Take your money and go someplace else.
Amber:         And don't you ever try to marry us again.
Ginger:        We found some guys that know how to treat a woman.
               [indicate Gunter and Ernst]
               [Gunter and Ernst glance at each other, while their
               white tiger looks about uneasily]
-- You sure can pick 'em, "Viva Ned Flanders"

% They walk off; Homer gets down on his knees.

Homer:    But Amber, I can change!
Ned:      Will you shut up?!
Homer:    All right, let's get our stories straight for Marge and
          Maude.  [the two begin walking down the highway]  We were out
          buying them fabulous gifts ...
Ned:      What's the occasion?
Homer:    Because we love them, jackass!  Anyhoo, we came out of Wal-
          Mart when suddenly, one hundred spaceships ...
Ned:      Homer!
Homer:    You're right, you're right, fifty spaceships beamed us
          aboard.  They gang-probed you, while I discovered an
          invention that blew their heads up and saved America.
Ned:      Uh, do I have to be gang-probed?
          [two vultures land on the highway behind them, first looking
          at Ned and Homer, then each other]
Homer:    Would you rather tell Maude the truth?
Ned:      [sighs] What did the aliens look like?
Homer:    Well, I only saw them from the back 'cause they were so busy
          gang-probing you.  Well hello, little birdie!  [fade to
          black]
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Homer and Ned scream through the first part of the credits,
% presumably being attacked by the birds.  "Cover your eyes!"  Homer
% yells.  The credits roll on Vegas marquees, accompanied by the song
% "Viva Las Vegas".
