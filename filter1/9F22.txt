% On the TV...

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, it's "Up Late with McBain".  I'm your
           announcer, Corporal Obergruppenfuehrer Wolfcastle.  And
           heeere's McBain!
   McBain: Ja, thank you, ja, that's nice.  Let's say hello to my music
           guy, Skoey.  [Skoey bows] That is some outfit, Skoey.  It
           makes you look like a homosexual.
            [Audience boos]
           Whoa, maybe you all are homosexuals too!
     Bart: This is horrible.
     Lisa: The FOX network has sunk to a new low.
-- Thank God for FOX, "Cape Feare"

% Marge comes in with the mail.

Marge: Lisa, you got a letter.
 Lisa: It's from my pen-pal Anya!  [reads]
 Anya: [voice over] Dear Lisa, as I write this, I am very sad.  Our
       president has been overthrown and
        [voice changes to that of a man]
       replaced by the benevolent general Krull.  All hail Krull and his
       glorious new regime!  Sincerely, Little Girl.
-- Hmm, sudden tone change, "Cape Feare"

% Bart gets a letter as well.  Except it's only five words: "I'M GOING
% TO KILL YOU", scrawled in thick red ink.  Bart quakes.  Scene switches
% to a pair of hands, the left one holding a pointed knife.  The knife
% is used to prick a finger on the right hand, drawing blood.  A "Things
% to do" list shows "Threaten Bart" and "Do laundry" written in blood,
% and both items get checked off -- in blood.  As an afterthought, "Buy
% corn holders" is added to the list.
%
% Just then, an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, "Spay Anything", comes on
% the TV.  Itchy stands in front of a sign, "WE PAY YOUR PETS $75", at
% "Itchy's Cat Hospital", and Scratchy walks by.  Envisioning a quick
% profit, Scratchy rushes into the building.  Itchy follows him in, to
% reveal an "S" in front of "PAY" that was formerly concealed.  Scratchy
% is shackled onto a table by two big canine orderlies, and Dr. Itchy
% turns on the spay ray!  Slowly, slowly, the ray inches closer to
% Scratchy's doodle.  Frantically, he glances over and sees the plug
% nearby!  Magically, his tongue extends towards the plug, pulling it
% from the wall in the nick of time.  Just then, Dr. Itchy returns and
% reinserts the plug.  The spay ray slices Scratchy to bits which slide
% off the table...Scratchy's eyes blink twice, convulsively, as the life
% seeps from his body.
%
% Lisa is very amused, but Bart feels the specter of the letter writer
% cast a shadow over his heart.
%
% Homer reads another letter and panics for a moment, but then he
% realizes it's for Bart: "DIE BART DIE", again in red ink.  Many
% letters are shown laid out on the table, all in red ink, except for
% one conspicuous letter, which says "I KILL YOU SCUM" in black ink
% instead of red.  Homer confesses having written it after Bart somehow
% put a tattoo reading "WIDE LOAD" on Homer's butt.  Everyone laughs
% hard, even Marge.  Nelson happens to be at the window, and he laughs
% too.

But who'd want to hurt me?  I'm this century's Dennis the Menace.
-- Bart, "Cape Feare"

% Homer suggests, "It's probably the person you least suspect," but Lisa
% doesn't think much of that idea.

 Abe: I say we call Matlock.  He'll find the culprit.  It's probably
      that evil Gavin MacLeod or George "Goober" Lindsay.
Bart: [dismissively] Grampa, Matlock's not real.
 Abe: Neither are my teeth, but I can still eat corn on the cob, if
      someone cuts it off and smushes it into a fine paste.  Now that's
      good eatin'!
-- Matlock and corn: good by themselves, twice as good together, "Cape
    Feare"

Um, I checked around.  The girls are calling you "fatty-fat fat fat",
and Nelson's planning to pull down your pants, but...nobody's trying to
kill ya.
-- Milhouse the informer to Bart, "Cape Feare"

% Just then, Nelson pulls down Bart's pants, and a horde of kids
% suddenly appear, chanting "Fatty-fat fat fat!" in unison.

[cheerfully] All right, this is dedicated to Bart Simpson, with the
message, "I am coming to kill you slowly _and_ painfully."
-- Marty, the wacky radio DJ, "Cape Feare"

          [Scene shows Marge in the kitchen]
   Marge: [threateningly] Bart, I am going to _get_ you...[brandishes
          some scissors]
    Bart: [gasps]
   Marge: [cheerfully] ...some ice cream at the store, since I'm saving
          so much money on Diet Cola!  [holds up a coupon]
           [Scene switches to Flanders outside]
Flanders: [threateningly] Say your prayers, Simpson...[brandishes a
          glove with knives on the fingers]
    Bart: [gasps]
Flanders: [cheerfully] ...because the schools can't force you like they
          should!  [clips the hedge] Maude, these new finger razors make
          hedge trimming as much fun as sitting through church.
           [Scene switches to Bart's classroom]
    Edna: [threateningly] You're going to be my murder victim, Bart...
    Bart: [gasps]
    Edna: [sweetly] ...in our school production of "Lizzie Borden",
          starring Martin Prince as Lizzie.
           [Shot of Martin in drag]
  Martin: [with an axe] Forty whacks with a wet noodle, Bart!
-- They're all out to get you, "Cape Feare"

% Marge appeals to Chief Wiggum for action, but the Chief is reluctant.

Wiggum: I'd like to help you ma'am, but, heh heh, I'm afraid there's no
        law against mailing threatening letters.
 Marge: [indignantly] I'm pretty sure there is.
Wiggum: Hah!  The day I take cop lessons from Ma Kettle --
   Lou: Hey, she's right, Chief.  [shows him "Springfield Law"]
Wiggum: Well, shut my mouth.  It's _also_ illegal to put squirrels down
        your pants for the purposes of gambling.
         [Shot of Eddie the cop with squirrels running around in his
        pants, and a bunch of cops watching and laughing]
        Boys, knock it off!
-- The perks of being a man in blue, "Cape Feare"

% Meanwhile, Lisa's been thinking.

Lisa: Bart, I figured it out!  Who's someone you've been making
      irritating phone calls to for years?
Bart: Linda Lavin?
Lisa: No, someone who _didn't_ deserve it.
-- As long as it's cheaper than 555-CORY, "Cape Feare"

% It's Moe!  Lisa calls up, tells Moe that they know he's behind it, and
% curtly informs him to knock it off.  Moe assures her he'll take care
% of it.  He releases the pandas he's been holding captive.
%
% Bart thinks more on his predicament.  "You're out there somewhere," he
% says, but implores, "Where?  Where?"  That "somewhere" is the
% Springfield State Prison, and the someone is...
% 
% ...Sideshow Bob!
%
% Bob is writing another letter, "SEE YOU SOON BART".  Afterward, he
% decides to write to "Reader's Digest".

  Bob: [narrating aloud] Dear "Life in these United States", a funny
       thing happened to me...uh...[faints]
Snake: Use a pen, Sideshow Bob.
-- The pen is mightier than the sword -- except when it runs out of
    blood, "Cape Feare"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 6:08]
%
% At the parole hearings, the committee grants parole to Snake, the
% reformed convict.  Next up is "Bob Terwilliger, a. k. a.  Sideshow
% Bob."  Sideshow Bob says goodbye to his cellmate.

  Bob: Take care, Snake.  May the next time we meet be under more...
       _felicitous_ circumstances.
Snake: [not understanding] Guh?
  Bob: Take care.
Snake: Buh.
-- Never made it to grade 10, "Cape Feare"

% In the court room, Sideshow Bob's parole hearing is underway.  Chief
% Wiggum takes the stand.

Wiggum: [miffed] Sideshow Bob has no decency.  He called me "Chief
        Piggum!"
         [everyone laughs]
        Heh, now I get it.  That's good.
-- Guess you _didn't_ have to be there, "Cape Feare"

% Selma's up next, and she explains, "Sideshow Bob tried to kill me on
% our honeymoon."  The crowd whispers among themselves, shocked at the
% revelation.  But Bob's lawyer asks craftily, "How many people in this
% court are thinking of killing her right now?"  A few spectators glumly
% put their hands up.  "Be honest," he admonishes, and many more hands
% go up, even a priest's.  Even Patty raises her hand: "Aw, she's always
% leaving the toilet seat up."

 Lawyer: Robert, if released, would you pose any threat to one Bart
         Simpson?
    Bob: [barely in control] Bart Simpson?  Ha!  The spirited little
         scamp who twice foiled my evil schemes and [maliciously] sent
         me to this dank, urine-soaked hellhole?
Officer: Uh, we object to the term "urine-soaked hellhole" when you
         could have said, "peepee-soaked heckhole".
    Bob: Cheerfully withdrawn.
-- We aim to please, "Cape Feare"

% But the lawyer presses on.

 Lawyer: But what about that tattoo on your chest?  Doesn't it say, "Die
         Bart, Die?"
    Bob: [conciliatorily] No, that's German for "The Bart, The."
          [The spectators laugh, understanding]
Officer: No one who speaks German could be an evil man.
-- Remember World War II?, "Cape Feare"

% Sideshow Bob's parole is granted.  With his new-found freedom, Bob
% decides to catch a movie, "Ernest Goes Somewhere Cheap."  Showing
% flagrant disregard for the other patrons, Bob smokes a cigar openly
% and cackles loudly at the inanity on the big screen.
%
% The Simpsons, too, are at the movie.  Marge is nonplussed: "That man
% is so rude."  Homer concurs, moving his own cigar deftly with his lips
% from the right side of his mouth to the left.  Homer taps Bob on the
% shoulder, warning him, "If you don't mind, we're trying to watch the
% movie!"  Just then, Ernest gets his head stuck in a toilet, and Homer
% can't contain his mirth.  Now it's Bob's turn to be nonplussed.  He
% turns angrily to Homer to berate him.

Bart+Lisa: Aah!  Sideshow Bob!
     Bart: _You_ wrote me those letters.
    Marge: You awful man!  Stay away from my son.
      Bob: Oh, I'll stay away from your son, all right.  [evilly] Stay
           away...forever!
    Homer: [quaking] No!
      Bob: Wait a minute, that's no good.
            [Starts to walk away, then runs back]
           Wait!  I've got a good one now.  Marge, say, "Stay away from
           my son," again.
    Marge: [angrily] No!
      Bob: [groaning] Oh...
-- I hate it when that happens, "Cape Feare"

% Bob angrily prepares to carry out some dastardly plan.  He pumps iron
% and even participates in a TV exercise program, turning, flexing,
% shaking, and bouncing.
%
% Meanwhile at the Simpson home, Chief Wiggum helps the family set up an
% elaborate network of trip strings attached to a Krusty doll.  He
% assures them the trap is infallible.

  Wiggum: Now Sideshow Bob can't get in without _me_ knowing.  And once
          a man is in your home, anything you do to him is nice and
          legal.
   Homer: [nefariously] Is that so?  [calls out window] Oh, Flanders!
          Won't you join me in my kitchen?  Heh, heh, heh...
  Wiggum: Er, it doesn't work if you invite him.
Flanders: [effusively] Heidily hey!
   Homer: [truculently] Go home!
Flanders: [congenially] Toodily doo!
-- Coulda worked, though, "Cape Feare"

% Homer decides to enlist the help of a local vigilante.

Man: Now don't you fret.  When I'm through, he won't set foot in this
     town again.  I can be very, _very_ persuasive.  [reloads his gun]
      [Scene change to a bar]
Man: [whining] C'mon, leave town!
Bob: No.
Man: I'll be your friend?
Bob: No.
Man: Aw, you're mean!
-- How to Win Arguments and Influence People, "Cape Feare"

% Sideshow Bob becomes more daring.  He drives through the neighborhood
% in an ice cream truck, naming the people he won't kill.  When he gets
% to the Simpson house, he mentions every name except Bart's, even "that
% little baby Simpson".  Homer is overjoyed his life won't be snuffed
% out, and he races up to impart the good news to Bart, but Bart only
% looks glum.
%
% Finally, the Simpsons resort to the FBI's Witness Relocation Program.
% They promise the Simpsons a new name, a new job, and a whole new
% identity.  Homer fantasizes about becoming John Elway, but Marge isn't
% sure it's such a good idea.  Homer tries to convince her: "It's a
% chance to turn around all our stinkin' lives."  Bart has his own ideas
% for a new identity.

 Bart: I'll be Gus, the lovable chimney-sweep.  Clean as a whistle,
       sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster.  Yeah!
Homer: Shut up, boy.
-- So much for _that_ new identity, "Cape Feare"

% The agents being suggesting possible new locations for the family.

Agent: We have places your family can hide in peace and security: Cape
       Fear, Terror Lake, New Horrorfield, Screamville --
Homer: [enthusiastically] Ooh, Ice Creamville!
Agent: Er, no, Screamville.
Homer: [scared] Aah!
-- A fertile imagination, "Cape Feare"

% One agent suggests a new identity for Homer.

Agent: Tell you what, sir.  From now on, you'll be, uh, Homer Thompson
       at Terror Lake.  Let's just practise a bit, hmm?  When I say,
       "Hello, Mr. Thompson," you'll say, "Hi."
Homer: Check.
Agent: Hello, Mr. Thompson.
Homer: [stares blankly]
Agent: Remember now, your name is Homer Thompson.
Homer: I gotcha.
Agent: Hello, Mr. Thompson.
Homer: [stares blankly]
        [A long time later]
Agent: [sighs in frustration] Now, when I say, "Hello, Mr. Thompson,"
       and press down on your foot, you smile and nod.
Homer: No problem.
Agent: Hello, Mr. Thompson!  [stomps on Homer's foot a few times]
Homer: [stares blankly]
        [to other agent] I think he's talking to _you_.
-- Some things just won't stick, "Cape Feare"

% The details are finally arranged.  The FBI agents give Homer the keys
% to a new convertible.  Lisa is delighted to discover "The FBI Light
% Opera Society Sings the Complete Gilbert and Sullivan" series of
% cassettes in the car.  The whole family sings joyously along to "Three
% Little Maids" from "The Mikado".  Little do they know that Sideshow
% Bob has strapped himself under their car...of course, the ride isn't
% so easy for the villain, what with the speed bumps and scalding coffee
% Homer throws over the side of the car.  Even worse...

Homer: Hey kids, wanna drive through that cactus patch?
 Bart: Yeah!
 Lisa: Yeah!
  Bob: [disguising his voice from under the car] No!
Homer: Well, two against one!
-- That's democracy, "Cape Feare"

% Homer drives recklessly through the cacti, much to Sideshow Bob's
% chagrin.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 12:52]
%
% We see an intro sequence very similar to that from "The Simpsons",
% except it's for a show called "The Thompsons".  Instead of showing
% Springfield looming over the horizon, we see a sign saying, "Welcome
% to Terror Lake" and a pier with houseboats.  A red convertible skids
% to a halt, and the Thompson family jump out and rush into one of the
% houseboat.  Inside, they all rush to sit on a couch, but once they do,
% a load of fish crashes through the roof and covers them.
%
% Homer exclaims, "Wow, a houseboat!"  He notes that a great advantage
% of houseboats is, if you don't like your neighbors, you can pull up
% the anchor and sail some place else.  All the neighbors do just this
% while the family laughs.
%
% Sideshow Bob has meanwhile extricated himself from under the car.  He
% has the misfortune of stepping onto ground where someone has left a
% bunch of rakes lying around.  He steps on several with his oversized
% feet; the bone-crunching smash of the rake handle flying into his face
% makes him groan.  {The last two rakes he steps on are cut in
% syndication.}
%
% Marge is concerned about the location of Santa's Little Helper, but
% Homer has resourcefully tied him up out back -- to a post that has
% been sunk into the floor of Terror Lake.

Marge: [ruefully] We've left it all behind.  How can you make a clean
       break with your life?
Homer: Relax, Marge, I tied up all the loose ends before we left.
        [Scene change to Simpsons' old house]
  Abe: [knocking] Hello-o?  Hello-o!  You have my pills!  Hello-o?
        [meekly] I'm cold, and there are wolves after me.
        [Howling is heard in the distance]
-- All the loose ends except one, "Cape Feare"

% Bart walks down the street, when he hears a voice say coldly, "Hello,
% Bart."  It's Sideshow Bob strapped to the bottom of another car.  Bart
% asks what Bob wants, but Bob plays innocent: "Surely there's no harm
% in laying the middle of a public street?"  Bob didn't figure on the
% parade that comes marching along, complete with elephants, as "Terror
% Lake celebrates Hannibal crossing the Alps."  Bart rushes home to tell
% his parents.

Homer: [cracks a beer] Ahh!
 Bart: Mom, Dad, I saw Sideshow Bob and he threatened to kill me!
Homer: Bart, don't interrupt!
Marge: Homer, this is serious!
Homer: Oh, it is not.
-- "Cape Feare"

% Sideshow Bob sits in his motel room, plotting his revenge.

[dictating while writing] Roman numeral three: surprise boy in bed...
[sips his tea] ...and, er, disembowel him!
No, I don't like that "bowel" in there.  [erases it] Gut him!  Ah, le
mot juste.
-- Sideshow Bob plots his revenge, "Cape Feare"

% Bart tosses and turns in bed, unable to sleep.  He eyes pop open as
% his door opens stealthily and a knife blade appears.  A madman jumps
% in, yelling incoherently, and Bart screams.  But it turns out to be
% Homer, offering Bart a warm brownie.  Bart admonishes Homer for
% frightening him so, and Homer realizes, "Oh, the Sideshow Bob thing."
% He apologizes, kisses Bart and leaves.
%
% No sooner has Bart closed his eyes that another madman springs into
% the room!  But again, it's just Homer, asking Bart if he wants to see
% his new chainsaw and hockey mask.
%
% The lights go out, one by one, on the Thompson's houseboat.  A single
% hand appears from the water, grasping at the railing on the boat, as
% Sideshow Bob pulls himself aboard, only to step on another rake that
% someone has left carelessly lying about.  He tosses it over the side,
% brandishes a machette, and cuts the boat loose from the dock.
%
% He walks into Bart's room and greets him.  Bart calls out to his
% parents, but Sideshow Bob has tied everyone up -- even Santa's Little
% Helper and Snowball II.  Lisa sees Homer drooling and snoring and
% mistakenly thinks he's been drugged.
%
% Sideshow Bob advances menacingly.  Bart opens the window behind him
% and jumps out just as Bob's machette whicker-snickers through the air,
% slicing a pillow in two.  Bart runs desperately from one end of the
% boat to the other, only to find the water inhabited by alligators and
% electric eels.  At last, Bart is trapped.

 Bob: Well, Bart...any last requests?
Bart: Well, there is one, but...nah.
 Bob: [curious] No, go on.
Bart: Well, you have such a beautiful voice.
 Bob: [arrogantly] Guilty as charged.
Bart: Uh huh.  Anyway, I was wondering if you could sing the entire
      score of the "H.M.S.  Pinafore".
 Bob: Very well, Bart.  I shall send you to heaven before I send you to
      hell.
-- "Cape Feare"

% Bob grabs Bart, sits him down, and breaks into song: "We sail the
% ocean blue/And our saucy ship's a beauty./We are sober men, and
% true/And attentive to our duty..." What Bob doesn't realize is that
% shortly before, they passed a sign reading, "Springfield 15 Mi."  If
% Bart can stall Bob long enough...
%
% Bart eats popcorn as Bob sings "I'm called little Buttercup..." The
% two do a duet: "What, never?  No, never.  What, never?  [together]
% Hardly ever!  He's hardly ever sick at sea..." Bob finishes off with
% "For He Is an Englishman", and the audience gives him a standing
% ovation and some flowers.  But the fun is over.

   Bob: And now [draws his sword] the final curtain...[walks towards
        Bart]
         [The boat hits a rock and Bob is sent flying]
         [Chief Wiggum and other policemen are on shore in their

   Bob: By Lucifer's beard!
Wiggum: Uh, yeah.  It's a good thing you drifted by this brothel.
-- Depends on who you ask, "Cape Feare"

% Bart explains how he tricked Sideshow Bob.

 Bart: I knew I had to buy some time.  So I asked him to sing the score

% At last, the family can return home.  Unfortunately, without Abe's

%
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 19:59]
