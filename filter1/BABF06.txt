% Homer sorts through the family's mail -- mostly bills, as usual.  
% Today's mailbag contains a surprise, though.

Homer:	[reading envelope] Springfield Anniversary homecoming!  
	Finally, a chance to relive my golden college years.  
	[opens letter]
Lisa:	Dad, you only took one course.
Homer:	[fondly] Remember my love affair with Ali McGraw?  She 
	used to call me, "Preppie."  Then she died.
Marge:	[reading letter] Oooh, there's a homecoming parade, a 
	cocktail party --
Homer:	And the big game between Springfield U. and Springfield 
	A&M.  I hate Springfield U. so much!
Lisa:	You went to Springfield U.  You hate A&M.
Homer:	So much.
-- School ties, "Faith Off"

% Homer and Marge arrive at the Springfield University campus.  He 
% finds his old dorm room, looking much as it did when he was a 
% student there, and starts to make out with Marge.  Suddenly, the 
% couple is interrupted by his old nerdy roommates.  (It seems that 
% Homer has forgotten the customary necktie-on-the-doorknob indicating 
% he has a girl in the room.)  Like Homer, the nerds have graduated 
% and found jobs in the real world.  One of them works on a secret 
% cyborg project.  Another fellow invented something sure to be in 
% demand:  A program that downloads porn from the internet a million 
% times faster than normal.  Homer is appreciative.
%
% Later that night, everyone attends a mixer.  Homer tries to mingle 
% with one of the guests.

Homer:		Yep.  So, because of me, all the dorms now have 
		security phones.
Lady:		Ugh.  [walks off]
		[the sound of a fork clinking on a glass is heard.  
		Attention in the room turns to a distinguished 
		gentleman, the dean, standing at a dais]
Dean:		And now let's give a warm alumni welcome -- you 
		know, clapping -- to Springfield U's all-American 
		kicker, Anton Lubchenko.
		[applause as Lubchenko steps up to the podium]
Lubchenko:	In Old Country, growing up in filth, Lubchenko 
		dreams to play U.S.A. football.  On my father's 
		deathbed, he made me promise -- 
		[Dean clears throat and makes "wind it up" gesture]
		Long story short:  Go Springfield U!
Dean:		Yes, thank you Anton.  Now folks, a seven and five 
		football season doesn't come cheap, and this is a 
		fund-raiser.
Homer:		[in terror] Ah!
Dean:		Seal the exits.
-- "Faith Off"

% The doors close and lock, and the Dean walks through the room with a 
% sack.  The alumni "donate" watches, jewelry, and other valuables.  
% When Homer balks, "Professor Rocko" and "Chancellor Knuckles" 
% relieve him of his excess money, until there is enough money to fund 
% the school's glee club.

Homer:		I'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a 
		ruse to get our money.
Benjamin:	That Dean is going to get an indignant e-mail.
Doug:		You should do it with bold, red letters.
Gary:		My computer has 512 shades of red.
Homer:		Have you nerds forgotten everything I taught you?  
		This calls for a prank.  I need ... [thinks] a 
		bucket.
-- Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it,
   "Faith Off"

% Under the cover of darkness, the nerds watch as Homer liberally 
% applies super glue to the inside of a bucket.

Homer:		[giggles evilly] Oh, this is going to be so great.
		[scene cuts to a security room, where two guards 
		watch Homer on a security monitor]
Guard 1:	I think I know that guy -- he ran over the Dean five 
		years ago.  Punch up that picture.
		[second guard displays a photo of Homer, about to 
		swallow a goldfish, on the monitor]
		All right, now age the picture five years.
		[the photo grows a long beard.  The fish rots down 
		to its skeleton]
		That's him!  Good work.  Now, let's see who's having 
		sex in the library.
		[second guard switches to the library, but all they 
		see is static]
Guard 2:	Ah, they scrambled it.
-- "Faith Off"

% Back at the Dean's house, Homer goes to set the glue-filled bucket 
% up so it will fall on the Dean when he opens the door.  He gets a 
% taste of his own medicine when *another* glue-filled bucket falls 
% onto him.  The boys from Kappa Gamma Tau fraternity ("Last in 
% grades, first in pranks") claims responsibility and runs away.  The 
% Dean walks calmly out of his house and bids good evening to Homer 
% and the nerds, as though finding a man with a bucket glued to his 
% head was a common occurrence at Springfield U.  Homer charges the 
% Dean but, unable to see, finds a statue instead.
%
% Next morning, the family tries to pry the bucket off Homer's noggin.

Bart:	[tries to pull the bucket off, but fails] Sorry Dad, it 
	just won't budge.
Marge:	I tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat, but your 
	father kept eating it.
Homer:	Couldn't you try a non-delicious fat?  [breaks down] Oh, 
	there's no such thing!
-- "Faith Off"

% Dr. Hibbert holds out little hope for a recovery since, beneath the 
% bucket, Homer is "more glue than man."  He suggests that Homer, like 
% other victims of comedy traumas, can lead a rich, full life.  To 
% prove his point, he pulls open a curtain to reveal three "truamedy" 
% victims.  One man drinks a glass of water, but the liquid squirts 
% out of him like a sieve.  Another man with a dog clamped to the seat 
% of his pants walks on a treadmill.  A third man stands nonchalantly, 
% reading a book while impaled on a swordfish.  He waves to Dr. 
% Hibbert.  Homer wants to see the men, but the bucket prevents him 
% from doing so.
%
% At home, Bart and Homer try to fix that problem.  He directs Bart to 
% carefully drill two eyeholes in the helmet.
%
% With two holes successfully drilled, Homer takes his family out for 
% a drive.  It's kind of hard to drive when you can only see through 
% two small holes in a bucket, so Homer eventually drives through a 
% cornfield and into a ditch.  He exonerates the bucket from blame.
%
% The family gets out of the car.  It seems that Homer has unwittingly 
% shepherded his flock to an old-fashioned revival meeting.  Brother 
% Faith's revival, to be exact.

Announcer:	[as upbeat music plays in the background]
		... for the healing love of Brother Faith!
Faith:		Oh, Good Lord!  [audience cheers] Oh, I feel it in 
		my belly now, Springfield.  Unh!  Can you feel the 
		power?
Audience:	Yes!
Faith:		Do you want to be saved?
Audience:	Yes!
Faith:		Now correct me if I'm incorrect, but was I told it's 
		untrue that people in Springfield have no faith?  
		Was I not misinformed?
		[miscellaneous mumbling sounds from the audience]
		The answer I'm looking for is, "yes."
Audience:	Yes!
Faith:		[singing] Now let's hear it,
		For the Holy Spirit.
		No need to fear it,
		Just revere it.
		He works in Heaven,
		That's a 24-7.  That's right.
		Check the Bible!  Yeah.
		John 2:11.  Jump back!
		Feel it!  Feel it!  Whoo!
Bart:		Wow, he dances better than Jesus himself!
-- Nothing like that good old-time religion, "Faith Off"

% A line of people waits to be healed by Brother Faith.

Faith:	What ails you, my son?
Cletus:	I done sprained my elby-bone, so it goes in the oppositty 
	direction.
Faith:	The power of faith compels you -- Heal!  [lays a hand on 
	Cletus' forehead, and yanks his arm back in the right 
	direction] Take that, Satan!
Bart:	It was a miracle, and it was gross!  Cool!
-- "Faith Off"

% It's Krusty's turn next.

Faith:	What affliction be-plagues you, my friend?
Krusty:	[whispers hoarsely]
Faith:	Come again?
Mel:	He paralyzed his vocal cords cramming too many "k" sounds 
	into a punchline.
Faith:	Oh, mercy, well I'm not sure there's anything I can do 
	for-- [suddenly grabs Krusty by the throat] Feel the 
	power!  [strangles him a bit] Release this clown!
Krusty:	Have you gone completely ferkakta?  Hey!  I got my comedy 
	"k's" back.  King Kong, cold-cock, Kato Kaelin.  Hey, you 
	Gentiles are all right!  [kisses Faith in gratitude]
Bart:	Wow, is there anything he can't do?
-- "Faith Off"

% Homer implores Brother Faith to cure him.

Homer:	Cure me!  Cure me!
Faith:	Brother, I sense that you are feeling trapped and 
	desperate.
Homer:	Yeah!  And I got a bucket on my head.
	[Faith tries to pull it off, but no luck]
Faith:	Oh, my, Satan really jammed that thing on good.  I'm going 
	to need a holy helper.  Someone who believes.  [looks at 
	Lisa]
Lisa:	No.
Faith:	Okay, movin' on.  I need someone with the power.  [sees 
	Bart] This golden-haired little boy.  Son, lay hands upon 
	your father's burdensome bucket.  [Bart does so] Now 
	proclaim:  "I have the power."
Bart:	[weakly] I have the power.
Faith:	No, say it like you mean it, boy.  I ... have ... the 
	power!
Bart:	[like he means it] I have the power!  [lifts the bucket 
	off Homer's head.  The crowd gasps]
Homer:	I see the light!  It burns.  [covers his eyes]
Faith:	Hallelujah!  Behold, this child has ... the power!
	[the crowd cheers]
-- Miracles happen, "Faith Off"

% Homer points out that he had hair before, but then notices them in 
% the bucket.  He puts the hairs back on his head and tries to smooth 
% them out.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:41]
%
% The revival has wound down, and Brother Faith puts up his snakes in 
% their cages for the night.  Bart walks backstage to ask him a 
% question.

Bart:	Excuse me, Brother Faith?  I've gotta know -- how did you 
	*really* get the bucket off my Dad's head?
Faith:	Well, I didn't, son.  You did.  God gave you the power.
Bart:	Really?  Huh.  I would think that He would want to limit 
	my power.
Faith:	[laughs] Oh, yes, Lord.  When I was your age, I was a 
	hellraiser, too.  [holds up Bart's slingshot] My slingshot 
	was my cross.  But I saw the light, and changed my wicked 
	ways.
Bart:	I think I'll go for the life of sin, followed by a presto-
	change-o deathbed repentance.
Faith:	Wow, that's a good angle.  [contemplates for a second] But 
	that's not God's angle.  Why not spend your life helping 
	people instead.  Then you're also covered in case of 
	sudden death.
Bart:	Full coverage?  Hmmm.
-- Pragmatic faith, "Faith Off"

% Bart relates his tale of faith and redemption to the masses.

Bart:		... then I said, "I have the power," and the bucket 
		came off.  [kids murmur appreciation]
Ralph:		Can you heal me?  I can't breathe good and it makes 
		me sleepy.
Bart:		I'll give it a whirl.  Devil ... begone [slaps 
		Ralph]
Ralph:		Ow!  [two coins fall out of his nose] My milk money!
		[milk spills from his nose] And my milk.
Kids:		Ew.
Milhouse:	You did it, Bart.
Nelson:		He really does have the power.  [to the kids] Go 
		forth and spread the word.
		[nobody moves]
		[shakes his fist] Spread it!  [everyone goes forth 
		quickly]
-- Go forth, or he'll smite your ass, "Faith Off"

% Lisa is still skeptical.

Lisa:	Bart, I hope you don't believe your own hype.
Bart:	Number of miracles performed by Bart:  Two.  Number of 
	miracles performed by Lisa:  Zero.
Lisa:	How can you believe all this mumbo-jumbo?  The bucket came 
	off Dad's head because the bright lights heated it, 
	causing the metal to expand.
Bart:	Heat makes metal expand.  Now who's talking mumbo-jumbo?
-- "Faith Off"

% In the kitchen, Homer struggles to come up with a good idea for his 
% homecoming float, but all he could think of was to create a flip-
% book cartoon of Moe dancing the hula.  Lisa suggests he try 
% something school-related, and Homer draws Superman fighting 
% Godzilla.
%
% That Sunday, Reverend Lovejoy delivers one of his powerfully boring 
% sermons.

Lovejoy:	In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul instructed 
		them to send ten copies to the Thessalonians and the 
		Ephesians.  But the Ephesians broke the chain, and 
		were punished by the ...
Bart:		I've got two words for this sermon:  [makes snoring 
		noises]
Lovejoy:	Am I boring you, Bart?
Bart:		Well, to be honest, yes.
Lovejoy:	Hey, I'm doing the best with the material I have.
Bart:		But church can be fun!  [parishioners laugh] No, 
		really, it can be a crazy party, with clouds and 
		lasers and miracles.
Homer:		And chili fries!
Bart:		A real preacher knows how to bring the Bible alive, 
		through music, and dancing, and Tae-Bo!  [jumps into 
		the aisle and begins Tae-Bo-ing]
		[parishioners cheer]
Mel:		He's kicking it old-school!
Lovejoy:	[to himself] Never give them an opening.
-- "Faith Off"

% But it's too late for second-guessing now; Bart is on a roll.  His 
% friends appropriate an exterminator's house tent to use as a site 
% for Bart's revival.  (Bart, in his infinite wisdom, instructs his 
% friends to air the tent out first.)
%
% Homer's float is taking shape in the driveway, thanks to Flanders' 
% flowers.  Ned doesn't mind the loss of the flowers so much as the 
% fact that Homer salted the earth so nothing would grow there again.
%
% Bart's revival gets underway.  Milhouse steps onstage to address the 
% sizeable crowd.

Milhouse:	Okay, Springfield!  How many of you are in horrible 
		pain?
		[crowd cheers]
		Then put your souls together for Brother Bart!
		[Bart skateboards in the tent and does a flip on to 
		the stage.  He catches the board as it falls from 
		the air]
Bart:		[holding up skateboard] Satan, eat my shorts!
		[crowd cheers again]
		[singing] I was a sinner, a real bad kid.
		What thou shalt not, I shalt did.
		Neighbor's cat I tried to neuter,

Sherri + Terri:	He took a whiz, oh, yes he did.

%
% Bart visits his friend at the hospital.  Milhouse's only evident

Bart:		This is my fault.  I'm so sorry.
Milhouse:	That's okay.  You can just heal me again, right?
Bart:		Well, I don't think I can.
Milhouse:	Please?  This cast is real itchy, and I tried to 
		scratch and the fork got stuck in there and I think 
		there was some food on the fork.  [camera focuses on

-- As it turns out, yeah, she does, "Faith Off"

% The sound of the referee's starter pistol signals the beginning of 
% halftime.  (The score is now SU, 18, and A&M, 7.)  Homer suddenly 
% remembers he has to drive his float.  The crowd obligingly passes 
% him down to the field.
%
% Bart and Lisa wait in a concession line somewhere in the stadium.  
% Lisa, apparently not convinced the veal died of loneliness, is 
% convinced she can get some tabouli there.  Captain McAllister sees 
% Bart, and asks if the can heal his depression.  Bart tells him that 
% he can't help him.  As the Captain retreats, Bart confides to Lisa 
% that he thought the McAllister "had it all."
%
% On the field, halftime floats and singers create a tribute to 
% halftime itself.  As the floats leave, the players retake the field.  
% Suddenly, Homer drives onto the field with his float, "A Salute to 
% Hazing."  The crowd boos this interloper, distracting Homer just 
% long enough to plow into Anton Lubchenko.  The crowd gasps in 
% horror.  Lisa looks downcast and sympathetic.  "Dad has the worst 
% luck when he's drinking."
%
% Dr. Hibbert quickly is on the scene.  When he touches Lubchenko's

% Homer, "encouraged" by the sight of Fat Tony on the stadium's jumbo-

% good, but it some becomes obvious the ball will fall short of the 
% goal post.  Suddenly, Lubchenko's foot kicks the ball again.  The 
% good news is that this extra boost gets the ball through the 
% uprights for the needed field goal.  The bad news is that the foot 
% is no longer attached to Lubchenko's body.
%
% Everyone is exultant, except Lubchenko when he realizes that half 
% his leg is missing.  In victory, Fat Tony tosses his icepick in the 
% air, and then remembers that what goes up must come down.  
% Meanwhile, on the field, SU fans pick up Lubchenko's leg as a

Marge:		Will that really work?
