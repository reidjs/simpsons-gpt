% Homer, Bart, and Lisa go grocery shopping for the family.  It turns
% out that the Simpson family doesn't live on bread alone.

Homer:	[reading list] "Olive oil, asparagus" ... if your mother 
	wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like 
	normal people.
Bart:	[holding up a bag of candy] I need this candy for school.  
	[Homer looks doubtful] Candy class.
Homer:	Well, okay, but get five bags in case I eat four on the 
	way home.
	[Bart dumps some additional bags in the cart]
Lisa:	My teacher said I need cupcakes.  Cupcakes to learn.
Homer:	In the cart.
Bart:	[toting a big ol' bottle of wine] I'm out of wine.
Homer:	Cart.
	[soon, Homer is pushing two full grocery carts.  The kids 
	bring up more snack food]
Lisa:	We need these because, we have to ... [trails off]
	[they just toss them in the carts]
Homer:	[holds up a six-pack of that wonderful Duff] My doctor 
	says and my garage mechanic agrees that--
Bart:	In the cart.
Homer:	Woo-hoo!
-- "Simpson Safari"

% Homer discovers that food shopping can be kind of fun.  "Yeah," Bart
% agrees, "I wish Maggie had to go to the emergency room more often." 
% At that moment, the scene shifts to one of Springfield General's
% examining rooms.  Maggie stands behind an X-ray machine, which
% reveals that she has somehow swallowed an entire magazine.  Marge
% tells Hibbert that it was an issue of "Time," if that matters. 
% Hibbert becomes concerned, not about the baby's condition (she seems
% fine), but because the front page of the Maggiezine has an article
% about hard-liners gaining influence in Syria.
%
% Back at the store, Homer and the other two kids are in the check-out
% line.

Homer:		Wait -- I changed my mind.  Stack it in the order 
		I'll eat it driving home.
Bag Boy 1:	Sir, please!  I already bagged it by color, and in 
		order of each item's discovery by man.
Homer:		Customer's always right; that's what everybody likes 
		about us.  Now, mush!  [claps hands twice]
Agnes:		You tell him, Jumbo!  [to her lane's bag boy] And 
		you, start over!  I want everything in one bag.
Bag Boy 2:	Yes, ma'am.
Agnes:		But I don't want the bag to be heavy.
Bag Boy 2:	I don't think that's possible.
Agnes:		What are you, the Possible Police?  Just do it.
Moe:		[to his lane's bag boy] Hey, hey, watch what you're 
		doing there, sack monkey.  You're bruising my 
		DuraLog.
Homer:		[poking Bag Boy 1 with a stick] Hurry up!  I can't 
		stand here jabbing you all day.
Bag Boy 1:	Ow!  Stop.  Bag boys have feelings, too, you know.
Homer:		No, you don't.
Manager:	Eh, excuse me.  Is there a problem here?
Homer:		No, I can handle it.  [sotto voce to Bag Boy 1] I'll 
		get you, squealer.
Bag Boy 1:	That's it.  On behalf of Sack Stuffers Local 199, 
		I'm calling a strike!
-- You have nothing to lose but your chains!  "Simpson Safari"

% The bag boy jumps up on the counter and quickly gains the support of
% the other baggers.  Homer is unconcerned.  The strike gains
% momentum, though, picking up support from unions of fruit packers
% and unpackers, shelf dusters, and even unattractive waitresses.  To
% back up their demands, the strikers use long poles to knock the
% groceries out of the customers' hands as they try to leave the
% store.
%
% The intimidation tactics work, at least in the Simpsons household,
% where the cupboards are almost bare.

Homer:	So hungry.  There's gotta be some food left.  [pulls a 
	couple of cans out of one of the cabinets, and reads their 
	labels] Gopher jerky?  Cream of toast?  Where did we get 
	all this crap?
Marge:	Most of it was sent by relatives who couldn't see very 
	well.
Bart:	[looking in through the kitchen, holding up a birds' nest]
	Hey, I found some eggs!  The mother abandoned her nest.
	[a large black bird flies up to Bart and pecks at him 
	aggressively, knocking him to the ground]
-- That must be the father bird, then, "Simpson Safari"

% Santa's Little Helper catches the scent of some food, and starts to
% sneak away.  The rest of the family notices this, and tries to
% follow him.  SLH tries to misdirect the family, and then makes a
% dash to the attic.  He opens a trunk and pulls out a lunchbox. 
% Before he can eat his prize, Homer snatches the box away with a
% triumphant "yoink!"  The box is Homer's old "Burke's Law" lunchbox,
% and it contains an equally ancient box of animal crackers.  Homer
% ignores Marge's warning for caution and wolfs them down.  When he
% bites into one of them, he winces in pain.  It turns out the box
% contains more than just stale cookies.

Bart:	Whoa, a solid gold animal cracker.
Lisa:	[reading box] "Find the golden giraffe and we'll send you 
	and your family to Africa!"
Homer:	Africa!  They're bound to have food there!
-- "Simpson Safari"

% Homer heads down to Animal Cracker HQ to claim his prize.  The
% executives are a little reluctant to make good on their promise.

Homer:	... and on my free African safari I want to everything on 
	this box.  I want to shoot a lion in the face, fight 
	Muhammad Ali, and ride in a convertible with two happy 
	zebras.
Exec 1:	Sir, that contest ended thirty years ago.  We don't even 
	make animal crackers any more.
Exec 2:	We make household poisons and Christmas lights.
Homer:	[holding the box up] Your box made promises of a 
	vacational nature, and I expect you to live up to them.
Exec 3:	We won't, though.
Exec 1:	Sir, with all due respect, an old box of cookies is not a 
	legal contract.
	[suddenly, the string on the cracker box breaks, and the 
	box swings into Homer's face]
Homer:	Ow!  My eye!
	[the executives huddle]
Exec 1:	We are in big trouble.
Exec 2:	He could sue us.
Exec 3:	This defective string ...
Exec 1:	... Yeah, it's got very sharp corners ...
	[they break huddle and turn to Homer]
	Mr. Simpson, we've decided to make good on your vacation.
Homer:	Woo hoo!  [sotto voce] Hey, mister.
Exec 1:	Yes?
Homer:	On the plane, I'm going to need two seats, [points to his 
	rump] for the twins.
-- They never go anywhere alone, "Simpson Safari"

% Homer gives the happy news to his family.

Homer:		The Simpsons are going to Africa.
Family:		Yay!
		[meanwhile in Africa, two tribesman dance around a 
		fire.  Suddenly, one of them stops]
Tribesman:	What is it, N'gungo?
N'gungo:	Evil is coming.
Tribesman:	What shall we do, N'gungo?
N'gungo:	[puts his mask on the other tribesman's head] You 
		are N'gungo now!  [runs away]
-- Something wicked this way comes, "Simpson Safari"

% As they fly to their destination, Lisa likens Africa to a beautiful
% jewel.  Marge is more impressed with some musical garment bags she
% sees in the in-flight catalog.

Attention passengers -- please prepare for our landing in Tanzania.

New Zanzibar.  [she is given another note] Excuse me, it is now called 
Pepsi presents New Zanzibar.

% The Simpsons meet their guide at the airport.

Kitenge:	Hello, hello, Simpsons.  Welcome to Africa.  I am 
		your guide, Kitenge.
Family:		Hey, how you doin' there?  Hi, etc.
Lisa:		Isn't that cute?  A bushbaby.  [indicates the animal 
		on Kitenge's shoulder]
Kitenge:	Where?  [notices the bushbaby for the first time] 
		Ahh!  Shoo!  Shoo!  [it leaves] Oh, man, I just 
		bought this shirt.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% The family piles into Kitenge's truck and drives past a series of 
% billboards extolling a man named Muntu.

Marge:		Who's Muntu?
Kitenge:	He is our leader.  He seized power in a bloodless 
		coup -- All smothering.
Marge:		Just like Jimmy Carter.
-- Indeed, like all good politicians, "Simpson Safari"

% Kitenge and the Simpsons pull up in front of a large boarding house
% atop a tree, where they will be staying.  A porter says he'll be
% down for the luggage but Homer tries tossing it up to him.  The
% luggage falls short of its mark and lands in a spider web.  An
% enormous spider sprays venom on the suitcase, shrinking it to a
% quarter of its original size.  Homer takes the incident in stride.
%
% At night, Bart tries to shoo away the mosquitoes buzzing around his
% bed.

Bart:		Help!  Ooh, this mosquito net's not working.
Kitenge:	No, no, you have it inside-out.  [rearranges it so 
		all the mosquitoes are now on the outside] There.
Lisa:		When do we get to see the animals?
Kitenge:	In the morning, little one.  Now goodnight, and 
		don't let the bedbugs paralyze.  [turns out the 
		light]
Marge:		Homey, did you remember to tip Kitenge?
Kitenge:	No he did not.
-- Note to self:  Always tip Kitenge, "Simpson Safari"

% Next morning the family starts their safari.  Bart has a book with
% pictures of animals in it.  When he sees one, he marks its picture
% with an "X."

Bart:	All right!  I got another one.  [marks a picture of a 
	warthog]
Lisa:	Hey, you didn't see a warthog.
Bart:	I'm looking at one right now.
Lisa:	Mom, Bart implied I was a warthog!
Marge:	Nobody's a warthog.
Bart:	What about him?  [camera pulls back to reveal a warthog 
	sitting just to Lisa's left]
Lisa:	Aghh!
Bart:	[laughs]

% Marge marvels at the spectacular African scenery.  Homer is more
% impressed that the truck's odometer has rolled over to 10,000.  (He
% even takes a picture.)
%
% Kitenge rolls to a halt in a nature preserve.

Kitenge:	And now we sit quietly and wait for nature to unveil 
		herself.
		[a rhinoceros hatches from a large egg]
Lisa:		Wait, rhinos don't come from eggs.
Homer:		What did you just see, Lisa?
Lisa:		I know, but--
Homer:		[insistent] What did you just see?
		[a giraffe sticks its head up through what looks 
		like a prairie dog hole]
Lisa:		Oh, now, come on.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% Kitenge points out a cheetah sitting by a tree.  Marge looks at it
% through binoculars, and says that it doesn't look that fast.  Think
% again.  In the time it takes her to say this and put down her
% binoculars, the cheetah has run right up to her.
%
% As the group drives to their next destination, Kitenge invites Homer
% to sing along to some African music.  Homer does his best, singing
% the nonsense-part of "Good Morning, Starshine."  Kitenge abruptly
% halts the truck.

Marge:		What?  What is it?
Kitenge:	Hmmm, poachers.
		[cut to three men putting a cheetah in a cage]
Lisa:		[gasps] That's terrible.
Homer:		Now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the 
		balance.  Whenever there are so many species that 
		people get confused and angry, a poacher is born.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% Kitenge fires a shot with his rifle, which scares the poachers away. 
% The cheetah uses the distraction to escape.
%
% With that unpleasantness out of the way, the safari party arrives at
% Olduvai Gorge.

Kitenge:	This is the earliest known fossil of a human being.  
		[indicates a skeleton half-buried in the sediment]
		It's over two million years old.
Homer:		Pffft.  I've got more bones than that guy.  If 
		you're trying to impress me, you've failed.

Homer:		[insistent] You have failed.

% The Simpsons visit a Maasai village.  They sit by the campfire with
% the village chieftain drinking a traditional Maasai beverage from
% cups.  Marge asks what kind of blood they are drinking and the
% family does a spit-take when Kitenge tells them it's cows' blood. 
% The villagers find this uproarious.
%
% Lisa and Bart show off some of the body adornments the Maasai gave
% them -- neck rings for the former, and a lip disc for the latter. 
% Later that night, the family goes more or less completely native and
% dances around the fire with the Maasai.
%
% A fine day of frenzied dancing comes to an end when Homer tries
% playing the drums along with the village musicians.  Some of the
% "drums" turn out to be a hippopotamus, who doesn't take kindly to
% having his rear end slapped around.  The hippo gives chase.  Kitenge
% jumps on the hippo's back and covers its eyes.  He tells the family
% to run for it, and they do, but a river blocks their path.  The
% hippo bucks Kitenge and stomps him a few times.  When the hippo
% finishes with him, it turns its attention to Homer.  Grabbing a
% Maasai shield and spear, Homer directs his family to the river, on
% the theory that hippos hate water.  Using the shield as a boat, the
% family floats away from the riverbank.  The hippo tries to follow,
% but shrinks away from the water, just as Homer said he would.
%
% The family isn't out of the woods yet.  They are floating toward a
% fork in the river.  The left branch looks placid, with a rainbow and
% calm water.  The right branch is an ominous rapids flowing between
% banks lined with forbidding rocks.  Homer has a tough time deciding
% which way to go.  Lisa recommends the left fork and for the first
% time in the trip, Homer listens to her.  He paddles with his hands,
% but leeches -- one of them the size of a man's forearm -- quickly
% attach themselves to his arms.  Homer shakes them off, but as soon
% as he does so, a wind pushes the "boat" down the *right* branch of
% the river.
%
% [End of Act Two.  12:23]
%
% Homer soberly considers the family's circumstances.

Homer:	Okay, here's the situation:  We're hopelessly lost and 
	about to die.
	[a crocodile roars up from the river.  The family screams]
	Don't worry -- being eaten by a crocodile is just like 
	going to sleep ... in a giant blender.
-- Well, that's comforting, "Simpson Safari"

% Marge wonders where the river goes, so Homer consults a map.  It
% isn't that helpful, though, since it's just an outline of the
% African continent with a cartoon monkey head superimposed in it. 
% Despite this, Homer is confident enough to conclude that, according
% to the map, there is no river.  Marge keeps Homer from walking out
% of the boat.
%
% The family spots some natives peering at them from the jungle brush. 
% The natives decide to greet them by sharing some artwork, but the
% Simpsons misinterpret their intentions.  Homer chucks the spear at
% them, narrowly missing one of the men.  "That's not funny," he says. 
% "I could have been hurt."  His friend sympathizes.
%
% The family continues to float peacefully down the river.

Homer:	So, do you think they settled that bag boy strike yet?
	[the go past a sign reading, "Victoria Falls"]
Lisa:	Oh, no, we're heading toward Victoria Falls!
Homer:	Here's why they shouldn't get anything.  One--
	[the boat goes over the edge of the falls.  The camera 
	cuts to the base of the falls, but the Simpsons don't 
	crash on the rocks at the bottom.  Instead, they land 
	safely in a giant flower by the riverbank]
Homer:	Whew.  This flower saved our lives!
	[the petals close in on the family]
Marge:	Oh, no, it's eating us!
Homer:	Not a chance.  [pushes through one of the petals, and the 
	family walks safely outside]
Bart:	Wow, Dad, how did you do that?
Homer:	[slight disdain] It's a flower.

% The family trudges onward.

                                            Are we insane yet?
Homer:	I told you, yes.  Now, Bart, go to the top of that hill, 
	and see if you can spot our hotel.  [points to a large 
	mountain]
Bart:	Mt. Kilimanjaro?
Homer:	Go.
Bart:	[resigned] Okay.  [he takes only a few steps before a 
	chimpanzee jumps out of a tree, frightening him]
Marge:	A chimp!
Lisa:	Hello, little fella.
	[the chimp walks somewhere offscreen]
Bart:	Hey, maybe he'll lead us to bananas.
Homer:	Or more mouth-watering monkeys.
	[the family follows the chimp]
-- Mm mm good, "Simpson Safari"

% The family trails the chimp, even going so far as to swing from
% vines, Tarzan-style.  Along the way, Homer continues his rant about
% the bag boys' strike.  (He's against overtime pay, for the record.)
%
% The chimp leads the Simpsons to Dr. Bushwell's animal preserve.

Lisa:	This is the place I've read about, where Dr. Bushwell 
	lives among the chimps.
Marge:	Oh, isn't that sweet?  He named it after his wife.
Lisa:	No, Dr. Bushwell is a woman.
Marge:	Well, now I've heard everything.
-- Marge the progressive, "Simpson Safari"

% Dr. Bushwell and the Simpsons enjoy afternoon tea and snacks.

Marge:		It's kind of you to take us in, Dr. Bushwell.
Bart:		Yeah.  Thanks for the grub.
Bushwell:	Grubs.
Bart:		Whatever.  [happily eats another grub] Ah, there's a 
		burst of flavor.
Lisa:		Your work has really inspired me, Doctor, and I love 
		your sensible ponytail.
Bushwell:	Why, thank you.  [to a chimp] See, Jo-jo, she likes 
		it.
		[the chimp looks a bit put out]
Homer:		So I noticed your home smells of feces.
Bushwell:	Yes?
Homer:		And not just monkey feces, either.
Bushwell:	Could we talk about something else?
Marge:		I, I love what you've done with these poles.

-- "Simpson Safari"

% Joan Bushwell describes her daily routine.

Bushwell:	Every day I get up at 5:30, watch the chimps, eat a 
		quick lunch of roots and water, then more chimp-
		watching.  After dark, I come home and think about 
		chimps until it's time for bed.
Homer:		You must be the most boring woman on earth.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% One of the chimps warns Dr. Bushwell of impending danger.  The
% poachers have arrived at the gate.

Poacher:	[using a bullhorn] Give us the chimps, and no one 
		gets hurt!
Bushwell:	Absolutely not!  [to the Simpsons] Will you help me 
		defend the refuge?
Homer:		Anything for these noble animals.  [watches a chimp 
		scratch his butt on a tree] So like us.
-- Some of us, anyway, "Simpson Safari"

% The fight is on.  Homer and Bart do fashion grenades from coconuts
% and use them to drive the poachers from the refuge walls.  They try
% to high-five one another, but their aim is off and the two slap each
% other in the face instead.  Marge and Lisa use blowpipes to shoot
% bees at the poachers' tires.  The stingers hit the tires with enough
% force to puncture their sidewalls and deflate them.  Then the
% poachers' Jeep inexplicably explodes.  Homer bends a tree into a
% catapult and places a monkey on it, ready for launch.  "Somebody
% light this monkey!" he yells, but the chimp doesn't think much of
% the idea and attacks Homer instead.
%
% One of the poachers breaches the camp's walls and starts putting
% chimps in a sack.  Lisa wrestles with him, and in the fight the
% man's outer shirt comes open, revealing a Greenpeace T-shirt
% underneath.  Lisa is understandably confused.

Lisa:		Greenpeace?
Poacher:	That's right.  And we're not leaving until we rescue 
		every animal here.
Lisa:		Well, if you really cared about chimps, you'd know 
		that Dr. Bushwell is their best friend.
Poacher:	Oh, is that right?  Why don't you tell her about the 
		diamond mine, Doctor?
Bushwell:	Diamond mine?  What are you talking about?
Poacher:	I'm talking about this.
		[there's a whistle hanging around Dr. Bushwell's 
		neck on a lanyard.  The man grabs and blows it.  At

Bushwell:	Why, what fascinating behavior.  I must document 
		this new activity.  [takes out a diamond-studded pen 
		and notebook]
Lisa:		[scolding] Dr. Bushwell!
Bushwell:	What, these?  Why they were a graduation present.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% One of the Greenpeace "poachers" estimates the mineshaft to be five

% A search of Bushwell's house turns up diamonds in nearly every
