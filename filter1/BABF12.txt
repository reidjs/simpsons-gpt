% Lisa bolts out of bed, scoops up her saxophone and Snowball II, and
% hurriedly decides which of her trophies to save.  She picks out her

% hallway.  Homer hustles everyone into the car and drives away from
% the house.

Homer:	Good work, everyone.  We're sure to be first in line for 
	"Duff Days."
Marge:	You set off the smoke alarm to rush us to a beer festival?
Homer:	[chuckles] I know.  I'm a character.  Now a little beer 
	music to get in the mood.  [inserts a tape in the car's 
	cassette deck, which plays traditional German beer-hall

	[dangling the handles from his finger]  Looking for these?

% The Simpsons arrive at the Duff Days site.  Homer switches off the
% beer music, to the kids' relief.  As soon as they step out of the

% Near the entrance, a man is dressed as Surly, one of the Seven 
% Duffs.

[loudly] Drink Duff!  [under breath] Responsibly.

% Marge volunteers herself to be the designated driver.  For her

% surrounded by razor wire is your idea of a good time.
%
% Lisa admires the Alco-Hall of Fame, featuring animatronic robots of
% Ulysses S. Grant, Babe Ruth, and Benjamin Franklin.  The later two
% get into a drunken shouting match.  Elsewhere, Bart discovers what
% it's like to be drunk.  Evidently, it's like being strapped to a

% to join his friend Milhouse, who's similarly "wasted."
%
% The highlight of the day is a contest to find the best bartender.

Announcer:	All right, Springfield!  Belly up for the Duff beer-
		tender of the year contest!  [crowd cheers] Now, 
		fresh from his appearance before the House 
		subcommittee on teenage alcoholism, Duff Man!  
		[Mello Yello's "Oh, Yeah" begins to play]
Duff Man:	Are you ready for some Duff love?
		[crowd cheers] All right, today we're going to find 
		out which of these bartenders has the right stuff to 
		dispense Duff.  From the Green Potato Pub at O'Hare 
		International Airport -- Michael Finn!  [crowd 
		cheers]
		From Juggernauts in Hollywood, California -- 
		Titania.  [the first syllable is pronounced to rhyme 
		with "sit."  The crowd lustily cheers the well-
		endowed woman]
		[cut to a shot of Moe preening his hair backstage]
		And now, the local mug who fills your mug with the 
		drug you chug, oh, yeah -- give it up for Moe 
		Szyslak!
		[Moe runs out onstage]
Moe:		Hello, Springfield!  How you --
		[interrupted when Titania splashes some beer on her 
		chest, wet T-shirt style, drawing massive crowd 
		response]
-- "Pygmoelian"

% The first round is trick pouring, which incidentally qualifies for
% course credit at Dartmouth.  As "Hippy Hippy Shakes" plays, Finn
% uses a cleaver to split a mug of that wonderful Duff in two.  The
% halves of the can fall aside, leaving the beer standing in place. 
% Before it can spill, he scoops it up in a mug.  Titania pours two
% mugs from two taps, while letting her natural assets bounce up and
% down.  The beer overflows the mugs.  Moe quickly pours mug after
% mug, arranging them to spell "Duff" in big letters on the bar. 
% Titania takes the round, and Moe looks disappointed.
%
% Round Two:  A Duff quiz.

Duff Man:	Duff beer is brewed from hops, barley, and sparkling 
		clear mountain ... what?
Titania:	[rings bell] Goat.
Duff Man:	Eh, close enough!  [crowd cheers]
		[cut to Homer, drinking beer]
Homer:		Ah.  You can really taste the goat.
-- "Pygmoelian"

% Round Three.  Duff Man announces it makes up 98% of the score,
% "making the previous rounds a complete waste."  He also reminds the
% audience that the winner of the competition will be featured on the
% new Duff calendar.
%
% Cut to the audience, where Homer, Carl, and Lenny sit next to each
% other.

Homer:	All right, guys -- one, two, three, ...
	[they lift up their shirts.  A letter is painted on each 
	of their chests spelling M ... O ... O?]
	"Moo?"  Lenny, you were supposed to be "E".
Carl:	See what happens when you skip rehearsal?
-- "Pygmoelian"

% Round Three is the Drunk Toss.  Michael Finn tosses one of the usual
% patrons from Moe's Tavern into a sand pit, like at a track meet. 
% Titania's up next, but she meets her Waterloo in this round.

Titania:	Ew.  You said if I slept with you I wouldn't have to 
		touch the drunk.
Duff Man:	Duff Man says a lot of things.  Oh, yeah!
		[Titania walks out in a huff]
-- If you can't trust Duff Man, who can you trust?  "Pygmoelian"

% Moe now has a shot at winning, but first he must toss Barney.  It's
% an uphill battle, since Moe can't even pick up Barney, let alone
% throw him any distance.  He falls back to plan "B":  brandishing a
% board with a nail in it, he chases Barney, who jumps into the sand
% pit to escape.  He lands a bit short of the first drunk, and it
% looks like Finn will win by a nose, but then Barney's tongue unfurls
% from his mouth.  It stretches a little past the first drunk's
% landing spot, and Moe wins by a tongue.

Duff Man:	And the winner:  Moe Szyslak!
Moe:		Aw, that's great; thank you, thanks a lot.  Uh, I
		just want to say that it was an honor for me to 
		compete against the Mick and the, uh, the chick with 
		the rack there.
-- Moe Szyslak, goodwill ambassador, "Pygmoelian"

% The barflies cheer Moe from the stands.  Lenny shouts, "That's my
% Moo!"

Duff Man:	And now, to take your official calendar portrait, 
		Duff's Vice President in charge of calendars and 
		fake IDs, Phil Angelides.
		[Phil takes the picture with a Polaroid (TM) camera.  
		An unflattering shot of Moe develops]
		Oh, that's a mug you don't want to chug.
Phil:		Knock it off, Larry, we can't put this face on our 
		calendar.
		[Moe looks at Phil and gives the thumbs-up sign.  He 
		doesn't look any more handsome in real life]
-- Should have gone with dogs playing poker, instead, "Pygmoelian"

% Homer and the kids spring Marge from the Rockin' Fun Zone, and they
% walk back to the car.  On the way out, they pass one of the Seven
% Duffs, who is handing out pink elephant balloons.

Marge:	Kids, would you like a balloon?
Bart:	[sarcastic] Yeah, right, Mom.  Then I'd like a rattle and 
	a wowwypop.  Actually, I would like a wowwypop.
Lisa:	Those balloons won't biodegrade for ten thousand years.  
	And if Bart gets a wowwypop, I want a wowwypop.
	[Maggie takes one of the balloons]
Homer:	Aw, Maggie wants a balloon.  And Daddy will take a hand 
	stamp so he can get back in.
Marge:	[threatening grumble]
Homer:	Just kidding.  [they walk out.  Homer slyly turns around]  
	Remember my face.
-- Can't get enough ... "Pygmoelian"

% Some time later, Moe paces nervously at the bar, waiting for the
% calendars to arrive.  Homer shows up, waving some envelopes.

Homer:	Moe!  The new Duff calendars are out!  The ones with your 
	picture.
Moe:	Oh, boy!  Move over, liquor license.  [takes a framed 
	license down from the wall]
Lenny:	[reading license] Hey Moe, this license expired in 1973, 
	and it's only good in Rhode Island ... and it's signed by 
	you.
Moe:	Yeah, yeah, I've been meaning to get that updated, uh, for 
	this state and, real.
-- Damn paperwork, "Pygmoelian"

% "Now," Moe says, "let's see the poster boy for the new Moe-lennium,"
% tears the wrapping off the calendar, and is surprised to see a
% sticker covering his face.  No, make that two stickers.  Or is that
% three?  How about six?  Finally, he peels off the last sticker and
% exposes his picture-imperfect face.

Moe:	[gasps] Am I really that ugly?
Carl:	Moe, it's all relative.  Is Lenny really that dumb?  
	[Lenny looks grief-stricken] Is Barney that drunk?  
	[Barney is saddened] Is Homer really that lazy, bald, and 
	fat?  [Homer also looks stricken]
Moe:	Oh, my God, it's worse than I thought!  [Moe and all the 
	bar patrons except Carl literally cry in their beers]
Carl:	[to the camera] See, this is why I don't talk much.

% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:11]
%
% The guys try to console Moe by pointing out he's not as ugly as the

	cauliflower ear there, and the lizard lips ...
Carl:	... little rat eyes ...
Homer:	... caveman brow ...
Lenny:	... don't forget that fish mouth.
Moe:	Okay, I get it.  I ain't pleasant to look at.
Lenny:	Or listen to.
Carl:	Or be with.
-- Moe's comforters, "Pygmoelian"

% Lenny offers something more constructive.

Lenny:	Hey, Moe, if you're tired of being an eyesore, why not get 
	some plastic surgery?
Moe:	Plastic surgery, eh?  Maybe they could dynamite Mount 
	Crapmore here [indicates his face] and carve me a new 
	kisser.
Carl:	Oh, I don't know.  Plastic surgery might make you look 
	good on the outside, but you still might feel bad in the 
	inside.
Moe:	But I'd look good on the outside, right?
Carl:	Yeah, but you'd feel bad inside.
Moe:	Plastic surgery it is!  Carl Carlson, you just saved my 
	life.
	[the cash register rings, and the camera angle shifts to 
	let us see that Homer is raiding the till]
	Hey!  Get outta there.
-- "Pygmoelian"

% Back home, Maggie plays with her new balloon.  Bart and Lisa go from
% being slightly condescending towards Maggie's entrancement to being
% entranced themselves.  Bart and Lisa both try to grab the balloon at
% once, but in the ensuing struggle, it gets away and heads for the
% front door.  Bart closes the door in time, but the balloon floats up
% the chimney and off into the distance.  Maggie sees her rubber
% friend going bye-bye, and cries.

Bart:	Okay, don't panic.  I'll get the bikes.
Lisa:	[facetious] I hope they're hoverbikes.
Bart:	Oh, man, that would be so awesome.
Lisa:	[groans]

% Moe gets his pre-operation evaluation from the cosmetic surgeon.  He
% stands, in his underwear, on a stool as the doctor gives him the
% look-see.  He examines Moe's face, and renders his verdict by
% mimicking a bomb dropping.

Moe:		It's hopeless, ain't it?
Surgeon:	No, no, no; I love a challenge.  First, we must 
		install buttocks ...
Moe:		Nah, nah, nah -- no luxury items.  Just the face.
Surgeon:	[drawing on Moe's face with a marker] Okay, I'm 
		going to move this up, this wider.  Gonna lose that 
		... I've never even seen one of these.
		[cut to show Moe's face, all marked up]
Moe:		Can the medical mumbo-jumbo.  Can you fix me or not?
Surgeon:	Well, we'll see.  You know, most faces need a little 
		remodeling, but this is a total tear-down.  Let me 
		clean up this mess I made.  [sprays some blue liquid 
		on Moe's face, and wipes the markings up with a 
		cloth]
Moe:		Hey, hey!  That really burns, there!
Surgeon:	Oh, stop it.  You're worse then Faye Dunaway.
-- "Pygmoelian"

% Bart and Lisa give chase to Maggie's balloon.  Lisa rides her bike,
% carrying Bart on her shoulders.  Bart tries to capture the balloon
% with a butterfly net, but it floats just out of reach.

Bart:	Gotta get closer.
Lisa:	Ugh, I'm trying.  Can't I get on your shoulders?
Bart:	I'm not riding a girls' bike.  Hey, it's getting away!  
	Step on it!  [kicks Lisa, like a cowboy spurring a horse] 
	Yah!  Yah!
Lisa:	Stop kicking me!
Bart:	Yah!
-- Now you know how Trigger felt, "Pygmoelian"

% Moe's operation gets under way, once the anesthesiologist switches

%
% Meanwhile, the balloon floats into the top floor of a tall building. 
% Lisa pulls up in front, and she and Bart run inside.  Seconds later,

%
% Inside the building, a group of suit-wearing men hold a meeting.

GOP 1:	We need a symbol.  Something that says we're gay *and*

GOP 2:	A little on the nose, don't you think?
	[Lisa and Bart come into the room]

Lisa:	Thank you.  [reading] "A gay President in 2084"?
GOP 3:	We're realistic.

% The surgery (and presumably the recuperation period) is complete. 
% Homer watches as the surgeon removes the bandages from the head of
% his patient, revealing ... a beautiful woman.  Moe is the *other*
% patient.  The doctor slowly unwinds his bandages.

Surgeon:	Well Moe, now we see if you go on my wall of fame, 
		or my blooper reel.  [The bandages come off, and the 
		camera cuts to show Moe from behind.  Homer and the 
		surgeon gasp]
Moe:		What, I'm a monster, right?  I knew it.  I guess 
		I'll just crawl back to live in the sewer, 
		periodically emerging to sue you.  [points at the 
		surgeon]
		[the surgeon hands Moe a mirror, showing him and he 
		audience that he's now very handsome]
		[gasps] Is that me?  [sheds a tear]
Surgeon:	Oopsie, we got some leakage.  Let me just cauterize 
		that for you.  [holds what looks like a soldering 
		iron to Moe's face]
Moe:		[in pain, as we hear a sizzling sound] Oh!  Ah!
-- Looks like we're headed to the wall of fame, "Pygmoelian"

% The doctor's pretty nurses say goodbye.  Moe still can't believe his

% Next, Moe tries to get back at the woman who turned him down for the

		[reading from a script] Angela, I'm afraid I --
Producer:	[interrupting] Thank you; next!
		[dejected, Moe leaves]
		[to Casting producer] What were you thinking?
Casting:	Well, you said you wanted gritty.  In other words, 
		ugly.
Producer:	I wanted Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island" ugly, not 
		Cornelius on "Planet of the Apes" ugly.  TV-ugly, 
		not ... ugly-ugly.
		[Moe is behind one of the sets, eavesdropping with a

		[flash back to the present]

Homer:		Well, it's time to get some closure ... extreme 
		closure.
-- "Pygmoelian"

% On the set, the producer -- the same woman who turned down Moe in

Producer:	Oh, shut up you windy old hack.
Actor:		And another thing, you have to stop calling me that.
Moe:		[walks up] Remember me?  Twenty-five years ago, you 
		said I was too ugly to play Dr. Tad Winslow.
Producer:	I did?  Well, that's why pencils have erasers, hon.  
		You're our new Dr. Tad Winslow.
Moe:		Really?  You mean it?
