% It's another suburban Sunday morning as the faithful file into the
% most holy First Church of Springfield.

    Bart: Hymns, here!  I got hymns, here.  Get 'em while they're holy.
          Fresh from God's brain to your mouth.  Heh heh heh.
 Lovejoy: And now, please rise for our opening hymn, uh..."In the Garden
          of Eden," by I. Ron Butterfly.
           [Mrs. Feesh starts playing]
Everyone: In the garden of Eden, honey,
          Don't you know that I lo-ove yo-ou?
          In the garden of Eden, baby,
          Don't you know that I'll always be tru-ue?
           [Bart chuckles]
   Homer: [quietly] Hey Marge, remember when we used to make out to this
          hymn?

-- Nothing like sinning to a hymn, "Bart Sells His Soul"

% A longish organ solo takes place, Mrs. Feesh gradually getting
% sweatier and more disheveled.  "Oh won't you come with me/and take my
% hand?" everyone sings.  The Rev. takes a closer look at the words and
% observes, "Wait a minute.  This looks like rock and/or roll."  Someone
% throws a beach ball at him and it bounces off his head.  Seventeen
% minutes later, Mrs. Feesh plays an arpeggio while various members of
% the audience (er, congregation) hold lit candles above them.  She
% plays the final five notes and collapses onto the organ.

% Lovejoy is not amused.  He assembles all the kids in his office to
% extract a confession.

 Lovejoy: I know one of you is responsible for this.  So repeat after
          me: If I withhold the truth, may I go straight to Hell where I
          will eat nought but burning hot coals and drink naught but

Milhouse: Well I don't want hungry birds pecking my soul forever.
    Bart: Soul?  Come on, Milhouse, there is no such thing as a soul.
          It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the
          bogeyman, or Michael Jackson.
Milhouse: But every religion says there's a soul, Bart.  Why would they

    Bart: Well, if your soul is real, where is it?
Milhouse: [motions to his chest] It's kind of in here.  And when you
          sneeze, that's your soul trying to escape.  Saying "God bless
          you" crams it back in!  [gestures up his nose] And when you
          die, it squirms out and flies away.
    Bart: Uh huh.  What if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the
          ocean?
Milhouse: Oh, it can swim.  It's even got wheels in case you die in the
          desert and it has to drive to the cemetery.
    Bart: [sighs] Oh, how can someone with glasses that thick be so
          stupid?  Listen: you don't have a soul, I don't have a soul,
          there's no such thing as a soul!
Milhouse: [smug] Fine.  If you're so sure about that, why don't you sell
          your soul to me?

Milhouse: Five bucks.
    Bart: Deal.

Bart: Aw, I sold my soul to Milhouse?
Lisa: [incredulous] What?  How could you _do_ that?  Your soul is the
      most valuable part of you.
Bart: You believe in that junk?
Lisa: Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart, it's the
      symbol of everything fine inside us.
Bart: [tsking sadly] Poor, gullible Lisa.  I'll keep my crappy sponges,
      thanks.
Lisa: Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever.  For
      five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years!
Bart: Well, if you think he got such a good deal, I'll sell you my
      conscience for $4.50.

% with a bouquet of flowers.  He arrives at its base, stands on a large
% red X, and emotes love.  Little hearts fly up in the air and burst
% near Itchy, who stands atop the tower.  Choosing to ignore a sign that
% cautions about throwing pennies from the tower, he removes a penny
% from his penny loafer and tosses it over the edge.  It starts moving
% so fast that Abe's hair flies back.  It melts a hole right next to
% Scratchy.

% Undaunted, Itchy runs over to a souvenir stand and grabs all the
% miniature Space Needles and drops them point first over the edge.

% Fuming, Itchy saws the whole top half of the Space Needle off.  Its
% shadow looms large above Scratchy, who looks up just as the point

 Ralph: Uh...I don't know.
  Bart: All you have to do is sign a paper that says I can have your
        soul.  [desperate] I need a soul, Ralph -- any soul.  Yours!
         [Ralph starts bawling]
Wiggum: [shining a flashlight] Hey, what's going on over there?
         [Bart hisses; he runs off into the mist and vanishes]

% The regular crowd sits in Moe's once again.  The restaurant is in the
% final stages of being taken apart by some other guys.

   Moe: Go on, take it all.  Get it all out of here.
Barney: You know, Moe, you might want to keep the fire extinguishers.
   Moe: Nah.  Too many bad memories.
Barney: {Well, look at the bright side, Moe: you still got us.}
   Moe: {Yeah.  Yeah, you know, that -- that actually makes me feel a
        little better.}
 Homer: {Why?  That was the problem in the first place: you were going
        broke because we were your only customers.  Wasn't that the
        problem in the first place?  That you were going broke?  Moe?
        Moe?  Hey, Moe.  Oh!  You're thinking about all the money you
        blew, aren't you.  [Moe nods] What was it?  Fifty, sixty
        thousand dollars?
        Moe, look: maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes
        you made from the beginning.  Moe?}
   Moe: {[exasperated] What?!}
 Homer: {Let me get a pen.}

% At Milhouse's grandmother's place, the parents sleep on a double sofa
% bed and Milhouse on a fold-out cot.  Bart knocks on the door.

 Grandma: A caller at this hour?  [to Mr. VH] You dial 9-1, then when I
          say so, dial 1 again.  [opens the door] [TM]
    Bart: [sees Milhouse, sighs with relief] Milhouse, please.
Milhouse: Bart, I can't play now.  It's 2:00 a.m.
    Bart: Milhouse, I've _got_ to have my soul back.  I'll do anything
          you want.
Milhouse: Uh...well...
  Mr. VH: Uh, Milhouse, give him back his soul!  I've got work tomorrow.
Milhouse: I'm really sorry...I kind of traded your soul to the guy at
          the comic book store.  But look!  I got some cool pogs: [shows
          them] Alf pogs!  Remember Alf?  He's back...in pog form.
    Bart: [incredulous] You traded my soul for pogs?!
           [runs out screaming]
 Grandma: Close that door!  You're letting the heat out.
  Mr. VH: Shut up, shut up, shut up!

% Bart decides to sleep in from of the comic book guy's store that
% night.  In the morning, the owner arrives.

Owner: If you are waiting for the Hi & Lois signing, it has been moved
       to the Springfield Coliseum.
 Bart: Please, you have something of mine on a little piece of paper.
Owner: Oh, so you're Bart Simpson, eh?  Well, since my breakfast burrito
       is congealing rapidly, I will be blunt: you're too late.  I sold
       your soul last night.
        [Bart looks worried]
       Yes, yes: I found a buyer right away for _that_ item.
 Bart: Who?
Owner: I am not at liberty to divulge the party, but they were most
       interested in having possession of Little Boy's soul.
        [Bart bangs his head]
       Um, excuse me: no banging your head on the display case, please.
       It contains a very rare Mary Worth in which she has advised a
       friend to commit suicide.  Thank you.  [eats burrito]
-- Too bad that friend wasn't Rex Morgan M.D., "Bart Sells His Soul"

% Bart walks home in the rain, dejected.  He enters his room and gets on
% his knees.

Bart: [plaintive] Are you there, God?  It's me, Bart Simpson.  I know I
      never paid too much attention in church, but I could really use
      some of that good stuff now.  I'm...afraid.  I'm afraid some
      weirdo's got my soul and I don't know what they're doing to it!  I
      just want it back.  Please?  [starts to cry] I hope you can hear
      this.
       [his soul floats down from above]
       [he grabs it and hugs it, and sees Lisa standing there]
      Lisa?  _You_ bought this?
Lisa: With the change in my piggy bank.
Bart: There's no change in your piggy bank.
Lisa: Not in any of the ones _you_ know about.
Bart: Oh, Lis, thank you.  [kisses her]
Lisa: Happy to do it.  But you know, Bart, some philosophers believe
      that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one [Bart
      eats the piece of paper] through suffering and thought and prayer,
      like you did last night.
Bart: Uh huh.  [swallows]
-- Word to the wise, "Bart Sells His Soul"

% Bart sleeps with a little smile on his face that night, the family
% pets curled up on his bed with him.  In his dream, he and his soul row
% toward the green castle on the island.  He hears Martin nearby, "Hah!
% It's like punting on the Thames.  Stroke!  Stroke!"  He and his soul
% glance slyly at one another, then steer their boat into Martin's.
% Martin's soul gets knocked over the side.  Bart and his soul laugh and
% continue on their way, chuckling.
