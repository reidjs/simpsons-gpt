       me right away; nobody cares that I didn't do it.  But I didn't!
       OK, look: I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing
       women is not one of them.  [softly] Like one time, we were having
       this race with the stupid old tiny bicycle with the big wheel in
       front, so I figure, "We'll see about that!"  So I get this big
       chunk of cinderblock, and --
Marge: [makes choking noises]
Homer: Oh, gotta go.  [walks off]
        [pops head back on] Innocent!
-- Classy public access TV, "Homer Bad Man"

% Lisa can't restrain herself.

    Lisa: Dad, you did it!  I am so proud of you.
     Kid: The switchboards are lighting up!
Everyone: Yay!
     Kid: Two calls: that's our best ever!  [answers one] Hello?  No,
          Janice doesn't live here...[answers other] Hello?  Yes, I _am_
          interested in long-distance savings!  _Very_ interested.
-- 1-800-PIN...aw, forget it, "Homer Bad Man"

% Homer is despondent.

Homer: [stirring a bowl] Aw, Marge, this is so depressing, my only hope
       is this homemade Prozac.  [tastes it] Mmm, needs more ice cream.

% The doorbell rings.

        [Homer answers the door]
   Man: [on pennyfarthing bicycle] So, er, you don't like the old-time
        bikes, huh?
         [kicks Homer in the face, rides off]
         [doorbell rings again; Homer answers]
 Willy: Homer!  I _love_ amateur video, and your show is the most
        amateur video I ever saw.  My hobby is secretly videotaping
        couples in cars.  I dinna come forward because in this country,
        it makes you look like a pervert -- but _every_ single Scottish
        person does it!
         [puts in videotape]
Quimby: [on TV] Oh baby, oh yeah, oh baby --
 Willy: Aw, no, that's Mayor Quimby.  [fast forwards] Ah, here we go.
 Homer: [on TV] Precious Venus...[gargles]
Ashley: Aah!  [slams door, runs off]
 Homer: Thank you!  [eats gummi Venus]
  Lisa: Dad, this clears you completely!
 Marge: You know, the courts might not work any more, but as long as
        everybody is videotaping everyone else, justice will be done.
-- A sad comment on American society, "Homer Bad Man"

% Homer takes the tape to the women's dorm at Springfield University.

  Lisa: See?
Ashley: Hmm.  Homer, I thought you were an animal, but your daughter
        said you were a decent man.  I guess she was right.
 Homer: You're _both_ right.

% On "Rock Bottom", Godfrey Jones is apologetic.

   Jones: In our mad pursuit of the scoop, we members of the press
          sometimes...make mistakes.  "Rock Bottom" would like to make
          the following corrections.
           [a list scrolls by very, very quickly]
    Bart: Wow!  V8 juice _isn't_ one-eighth gasoline.
   Homer: And Ted Koppel _is_ a robot!
    Lisa: There's you, Dad!
Everyone: Yay!
   Jones: Tomorrow, on "Rock Bottom":
           [slomo of Willy walking into Godfrey's office] he's a
          foreigner who takes perverted videos of you when you least
          expect it.  He's "Rowdy Roddy Peeper"...
   Homer: Oh, that man is _sick_!
   Marge: Groundskeeper Willy saved you, Homer.
   Homer: But listen to the music!  He's evil!
   Marge: Hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything
          you hear?
   Homer: Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing.
           [family walks off, disgruntled]
   Homer: [hugs TV] Let's never fight again.
