Kent:   Springfield's oldest resident has died.  [chuckles] No, it wasn't
        Mr. Burns, it was this majestic old redwood, which was brutally cut
        down last night ...
Lisa:   Ugh ....
Kent:   ... not by loggers, but by lightning.

Kent:   Lightning attracted by this metal bucket.  [Lisa's care bucket]
Lisa:   Yech ....
Kent:   Still unknown is the fate of tree-sitter Lisa Simpson.
Wiggum: I'm afraid it doesn't look good, Kent.  We found her sleeping bag
