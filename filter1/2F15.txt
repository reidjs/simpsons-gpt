Homer: Little Lisa, Lisa Simpson.  You know, I always felt you were the
       best thing my name ever got attached to.  Since the time you
       learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me.
 Lisa: Oh, Dad --
Homer: No, no, let me finish.  I just want you to know I've always been
       proud of you.  You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it
       all yourself.  You helped me understand my own wife better and
       taught me to be a better person, but you're also my daughter, and
       I don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you
       --
 Lisa: Dad, you're babbling.
Homer: See?  You're still helping me.
-- The joy of children, "Lisa's Wedding"

 Lisa: [noticing the cufflinks] Hey Dad, did you forget to give those
       cufflinks to Hugh?
Homer: Uh...no.
 Lisa: Well?
Homer: I found them on the nightstand this morning and...well, I guess
       they weren't his cup of tea.  Don't worry about it.
 Lisa: But you've been going on about these all week.  I'm sure he just
       forgot.
        [walks to where Hugh is preparing]
 Hugh: Lisa, we're not supposed to see each other before the wedding.
       It's tradition.
 Lisa: What about _my_ family's tradition?  [holds up cufflinks]
 Hugh: Surely you don't want me to wear those?  In front of my parents
       and their friends?
 Lisa: But you promised my Dad you would.
 Hugh: I was just humoring him, darling.  Actually, he frightens me a
       bit.
 Lisa: I know they look a little silly but his feelings will be hurt if
       you don't wear them.
 Hugh: [resigned] Fine.  [wears them]
-- The delicate issue of the cufflinks, "Lisa's Wedding"

Hugh: I must say, you were right.  This has been quite trying.  You
      know, I've attempted to enjoy your family on a personal level, on
      an ironic level, as a novelty, as camp, as kitsch, as cautionary
      example...nothing works.  Frankly, I'll be quite relieved when we
      get back to England and we won't have to deal with them.
Lisa: Are you saying we won't see my family again?
Hugh: Well, possibly your mother will come when the children are born.
Lisa: I can't believe I'm hearing this.  I don't want to cut my family
      out of my life.
Hugh: Really?  But Lisa, you're better than this place: you're like a
      flower that grew out of a pot of dirt.
Lisa: That's a horrible thing to say!
Hugh: Well, come on, _you_ complain about them more than anyone.
Lisa: Maybe, but I still love them!  And I don't think you understand
      that.

% Meanwhile, in the main tent...

   Lovejoy: And now, to sing "Amazing Grace", Miss Maggie Simpson.
   Hibbert: Heh heh, she's quite a hellion but she does have an
            incredible voice.
    Maggie: Ahem.  [breathes in]
      Hugh: [rushing in] Stop everything!  The wedding has been called
            off.
             [everyone gasps and chatters]
Nelson Sr.: Ha ha!
Nelson Jr.: Ha ha!
    Krusty: Ohh...
   Lovejoy: Uh, this is very sad news, and it never would have happened
            if the wedding had been inside the church with God instead
            of out here in the cheap showiness of nature.
     Doris: Who wants cake?
             [everyone stampedes for it]
-- A happy ending for some, "Lisa's Wedding"

% Lisa walks out past a line of guests, dejected, and into a nearby
% wood.  She weeps.  The scene fades back to young Lisa, who turns
% around to see the soothsayer in her tent.

Woman: The next day, Hugh goes back to England, and you never see him
       again.
 Lisa: Wow.  Now that I know all this, isn't there any way to change the
       future?
Woman: No...but try to look surprised.
 Lisa: I thought you said you'd tell me about my _true_ love.
Woman: Oh, you'll have a true love, but I specialize in foretelling the
       relationships where you get jerked around.
        [laughs manically; throws a smoke bomb and continues to laugh]

-- Less-than-spectacular exits, "Lisa's Wedding"

% As Lisa walks out of the tent, the bunny (er, esquilax) hops into her
% arms.  She carries it back to Friar Wiggum's and puts it in its box.

Homer: Lisa, Lisa!  Where were you?  You missed the most incredible
       thing.
 Lisa: [grateful] Hi, Dad!  [hugs him]
Homer: I ate seven pounds of fudge!
 Lisa: Wow!
Homer: The man at the stand said it was a record.
 Lisa: Wow!  What else did you do, Dad?
Homer: I rode the teacups, then I got a little sick and I had to sit
       down.  But then, I rode them again...
