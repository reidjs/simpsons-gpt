% It's the School District Safety Awards night, and the winner is...
% no, that can't be! Not Otto?!

Wow. You know, most of my life I've... I've had to live with the shame
of being a screw-up. But now, as I stand here with the award for the
district's safest bus driver... well, it... it's like a dream come
true.
-- The fantasies of a bus driver, "Homerpalooza"

% Of course it is a dream, as the district's safest bus driver would
% never be sleeping on the road, which is what Otto is doing right now.
% Milhouse wakes him up just in time to dodge Jasper who is crossing
% the street, but abrupt maneuvers send the bus spinning off control
% into the auto wrecking yard. With all the professionalism he has,
% Otto manages to park the bus right into the car crusher. The kids run
% out screaming as the bus is quickly reduced to one tenth of its size.

So, um... who's good at keeping secrets?
-- Otto, about to design a cover-up, "Homerpalooza"

Dear parents. Due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto
wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks.
By reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal
responsability on our part in perpetuity throughout the universe.
-- Marge reads the school's letter, "Homerpalooza"

Homer: Well, we'll have to organize a car pool. Hey! Every day will be
       like a road trip... with your dad... to school!
 Kids: [groans]
-- This almost sounds exciting, "Homerpalooza"

% The next morning, Homer takes the responsability of car pooling Bart,
% Lisa, Milhouse, Nelson and Janey. He tries to make the trip fun, but
% fails miserably.

Homer: So... how about those rainbow suspenders, huh?
 Bart: Dad...?
Homer: Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?
 Bart: Dad!
Homer: I see these kids now with "Jive" printed on their shirts.
       Pftt... Now, I can teach you how you're supposed to say "jive".
 Lisa: Dad... Please just drive the car, dad.
Homer: I'm watching the road, sweetie.
       You <jive> turkey. See? You got to <sass> it. Quit <jivin'> me,
       turkey. You got to sass it. A "turkey" is a bad person.
-- On the verge of beating Grampa, "Homerpalooza"

% In order to sink even lower, Homer turns on the radio to his favorite
% station, which he's the only one in the car to enjoy.

KFSL -- Fossil 103. Classic hits from Abba to Zeppelin, comma, Led.
-- Never thought I'd miss KBBL, "Homerpalooza"

% Milhouse asks Homer to change the radio station, but Homer retorts
% that it's Grand Funk Railroad.  No one knows what he's talking about,
% and Homer is surprised.
%
% Homer drops the kids to school, and they rush out of the car.

For more information on Grand Funk, consult your school library!
-- Homer's word of wisdom, "Homerpalooza"

% That afternoon, on the way back, Homer explains to the kids how he
% nods his head to the music.

 Bart: Dad, please, you're embarrassing us.
Homer: No, I'm not.
-- What an argument, "Homerpalooza"

% And thus Homer keeps going on and on...

Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson airplane, which cleared
the way for Jefferson starship. The stage was now set for the Alan
Parsons project, which I believe was some sort of hovercraft.
-- Homer, who else, "Homerpalooza"

 Bart: Dad! No one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You
       have the worst, lamest taste in music ever.
	[turns off the radio]
Homer: I'm just trying to party with you guys.
 Bart: Homer, first of all, it's "par-tay", and second, we wouldn't
       "par-tay" with you if you were the last dad on Earth.
-- "Homerpalooza"

% This slap in the face troubles Homer, so he decides to take a walk at
% his favorite music store, "Good Vibrations" --later renamed "Suicide
% Notes".  He searches for the latest Bread releases and is surprised
% when directed to oldies.

Homer: Now, here are some of your no-name bands. Sonic Youth? Nine Inch
       Nails? Hullabalooza?
Clerk: Hullabalooza is a music festival; the greatest music festival of
       all time.
Homer: There can only be one truly great festival a lifetime and it's
       the "Us Festival".
Clerk: The <what> festival?
Homer: The "Us Festival"! Geez! It was sponsored by the guy from Apple
       Computers.
Clerk: <What> computers?
-- You know, the guy with the suit, "Homerpalooza"

% Homer walks in the street, dejected.

Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in
1974. It's a scientific fact.
-- Homer, "Homerpalooza"

% Flashback to the aforementioned year, where a group of people are
% installing a strobe light in a custom van of theirs: "Quadraphonic
% sound, a waterbed, and now a strobe light. Gentlemen, say hello to
% the second-base mobile." When they resume dancing on "Frankenstein"
% with the strobe light on, Homer tries to join in, but fails
% miserably.
%
% "Back then, we didn't care what anyone thought and the chicks found
% that irresistible." narrates Homer, as he remembers drinking from the
% school fountain as two teen girls walk by. "I think you're <cool>,
% Homer Simpson." affirms one of them, and even if the other one
% declares that this remark was mean, Homer takes it as a compliment.
%
% "But most of all, I remember the music..."  Homer and Barney, in
% Homer's room, butcher "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing", when Abe
% interrupts them.  "What the hell are you two doing?"  "It's called
% rockin' out," replies Barney, and Homer tells Abe he wouldn't
% understand 'cause he's not "with it".

I used to be with it, but then they changed what "it" was. Now, what
I'm with isn't it, and what's "it" seems weird and scary to me.
-- "Homerpalooza"

% He warns them, "It'll happen to you."  But teen Homer denies the
% undeniable, and looks at the mirror: "We're gonna keep on rockin'
% forever... forever... forever..." Fade-in to adult Homer, looking at
% his reflection, and realizing those words have lost their meaning.

Marge: What's wrong, Homie?
Homer: [sighs] I went to the record store today and they were playing
       all that music I've never heard of. It was like the store had
       gone crazy.
Marge: Hmm. Record stores have always seemed crazy to me, but it
       doesn't upset me. Music is none of my business.
-- "Homerpalooza"

% "That's fine for you, Marge", Homer says, "but I used to Rock 'N'
% Roll all night and party everyday."  Now he finds he has little time
% left to get funky.
       
I've gotta get out of this rut, and back into the groove.
-- Homer, "Homerpalooza"

% Marge asks him to include Bart and Lisa.
%
% The next morning, Bart and Lisa apprehend another humiliation.

Bart: Dear Lord, if you keep Homer from embarrassing us today, we
      promise to build several churches in your honor.
Lisa: Bart, no!
-- The price to pay, "Homerpalooza"

% Homer passes in front of Milhouse without stopping.

Hey, wait! I'm okay today! My mom bought me deodorant!
-- Milhouse, "Homerpalooza"

 Lisa: Dad, you forgot to pick up Milhouse.
Homer: [exagerated] I <did>? I must be getting forgetful in my old age.
       Open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.
-- This stuff doesn't seem to be working at all, "Homerpalooza"

% Lisa doesn't understand the point of all this, but Homer keeps
% pointing at the glove compartent. Curious, she opens it, to find...

Homer: Well? What have we here? Looks like your uncool dad scored
       tickets to Hullabalooza!
 Lisa: [gasps] Bart... these look real...
 Bart: Check the authenticator spot
	[Lisa removes a sticker, which reveals a microchip]
 Chip: This is an authentic Hullabalooza ticket. For authentic
       refreshment, eat Clark bars. And for totally outrageous class
       rings, it's Josten's. Go, Josten's!
-- "Homerpalooza"

You're not going to school today. Today your classroom will be the
Capitol City amphitheater; your teacher, four dozen rock bands. So, get
ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your
father!
-- Homer, "Homerpalooza"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 7'28"]
%
% Once they reach Hullabalooza ("Free nose piercing with every
% admission"), the kids feel right at home.

Wow! It's like Woodstock, only with advertisements everywhere and tons
of security guards.
-- Lisa reflects on Hullabalooza, "Homerpalooza"

% They get let in, but Homer has to surrender his homemade kahlua.

 Lisa: Generation X may be shallow but at least they have tolerance and
       respect for all people.
Homer: Hey: a freak show!
-- To a certain extent, "Homerpalooza"

% Performers include a bearded woman, a man smoking dozens of
% cigarettes at one time, two poodles, and a man able to stick nails in
% his nose.  After hitting his finger with the hammer, he presents the
% next attraction: Cypress Hill.

Before we start, we have a lost child here. If she's not claimed within
the next hour, she will become property of Blockbuster Entertainment.
-- A warning from Cypress Hill, "Homerpalooza"

Bart: [sniffing] What is that smell?
Lisa: It smells like Otto's jacket...
-- Which can only mean one thing... "Homerpalooza"

% Homer, on his side, is buying some kind of Jamaican hat.

Clerk: Dude, karma.
Homer: What?
Clerk: [pointing at the hat] Karma, <karma>.
	[pause]
Homer: [neuter] Oh, I get it. [walks away]
-- But I don't, "Homerpalooza"

% Just as Bart and Lisa are starting to appreciate the show, Homer
% shows up, wearing this hat of his.

 Bart: Dad, you cannot wear that! That's a rastafarian hat.
Homer: Pft. Hey, I've been safariing since before you were born.
 Lisa: Wearing a Jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your
       connection to reggae music.
Homer: Well, <excuse> me.
       [sticks a "Too cool for this planet" sticker to his hat]
 Bart: You know what, dad? Maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a
       while.
	[the kids run away]
-- Run boy, run for your life!, "Homerpalooza"

% Left alone, it's time for Homer to get in touch with the young
% people.  He tries to blend in the crowd, but his Jamaican-rastafarian
% hat gets in the way.

Homer: Good concert, am I right?
Teen1: Yeah, nice try, narc.
Teen2: Where's a narc?
Teen3: Who?
Teen1: That fat Jamaican guy.
Homer: What did I say? What's going on?
Teen4: Hey, we're just trying to have a good time, narc. Why do you
       want to destroy us?
Teen5: Don't commit your hate crimes here. [yelling] HATE CRIME!
-- All I did was say "Gimme four more justices", "Homerpalooza"

% Thus Homer finds himself on the top of the crowd, being led outside.
%
% Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa are at the concert listening to Smashing
% Pumpkins, where the crowd is  dancing in sort sort of nostalgic
% trance.

Lisa: It may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd.
Bart: Eh, making teenagers depressed is like shooting fish in a barrel.
-- "Homerpalooza"

% Homer walks away, disillusioned as always.

Oh... Makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly
I'm uncool.
-- Hand Homer a mirror, "Homerpalooza"

% In his rage, Homer kicks a cannon, which goes haywire. After several
% bursts, it shoots its bullet right into Homer's stomach. After
% bouncing off and falling on the ground, the bullet breaks open,
% revealing an inflatable pig, which soars in the sky.

    Tech: Aw, man. There goes Peter Frampton's big finale. He's gonna
	  be pissed off.
Frampton: You're damn right I'm going to be pissed off; I bought that
	  pig at Pink Floyd's yard sale!
-- Oink oink, "Homerpalooza"

% But the crowd is more impressed with Homer's ability to withstand
% such a blow without any side effects. Even a manager is impressed:

Sir, I run Hullabalooza's pageant of the transmundane --the freak show,
and I've been looking for a big fatso to shoot with a cannon. I'd like
very much for you to be that fatso.
-- Hullabalooza's manager wants to hire Homer, "Homerpalooza"

% Homer is flattered, but Marge doesn't take it the same way.

Marge: So... you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
Homer: I don't think I have a choice, Marge.
Marge: Of course you have a choice.
Homer: How do you figure?
Marge: You don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity
       came along.
Homer: You know, Marge, in some ways, you and I are very different
       people.
-- After all these years, he finds out, "Homerpalooza"

% As you could've guessed, Homer stuck with his idea, and is about to
% be shot on stage for the first time ever.

[in a shy, nervous tone] Hi everybody. Is everybody... good?
-- Homer is about to begin his number, "Homerpalooza"

% Homer puts on his safety glasses, takes place in front of the cannon,
% and receives the bullet right in the stomach. He quickly gets up,
% though, and is acclaimed by the crowd.
%
% In backstage, Homer autographs a cannon ball: "Stay in school, your
% hero, Homer". The kid takes the ball, but is instantly crushed by it.

Corgan: Hey cannonball, I like your statement: when life takes a cheap
	shot at you, you stand your ground. Billy Corgan, Smashing
	Pumpkins.
 Homer: Homer Simpson, smiling politely.
-- That's not a band!, "Homerpalooza"

 Homer: You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your
	gloomy music, they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I
	can't possibly provide.
Corgan: Well, we try to make a difference.
-- Positive differences, check with Barry Manilow, "Homerpalooza"

% At school, Bart reads a letter from his father.  "Dear Bart and Lisa.
% All is well on tour with America's most popular alternative music
% festival."  Cut to a shot of the Hullabalooza bus on a 3-way
% crossing.  They turn left for Cleveland, then back and right for
% Cincinnati, then they change their minds and turn back home.
%
% "Our first job is to entertain."  Homer gets shot with a cannon, with
% cheering from the crowd.  "And I like to think sometimes we get a
% message across as well."  Same thing, but this time Homer has "No
% Litter" written on his stomach before he gets shot.
%
% "But the main thing is: I've finally tapped into that spirit of self-
% destruction that makes Rock 'N' Roll the king of music."  Everyone on
% the bus is cheering Homer, who's "water-skiing" with the bus, only
% with frying pans instead of skis.  Cypress Hill throws cans at him.
% Homer yells "Woo-hoo!"

% And the tour keeps going on, with a huge success.

Teen1: Oh, here comes that cannonball guy. He's cool.
Teen2: Are you being sarcastic, dude?
Teen1: I don't even know anymore.
-- Well, duh, "Homerpalooza"

Thank you! And remember, don't trust anyone over 30! And now, Peter
Frampton!
-- Homer, after his number, "Homerpalooza"

Corgan: Hey, Homer, looks like our next stop is your hometown,
	Springfield.
D'Arcy: Is it true that we have to bring our own water?
 Homer: We got a little rule back home: if it's brown, drink it down;
	if it's black, send it back.
-- Springfield, still a national proudness, "Homerpalooza"

Chamberlin: The hometown show's the big one, Homer.
       Iha: Yeah, people who called you a weirdo in high school get to
	    see what a successful freak you've become.
	    [points to D'Arcy]
    D'Arcy: Hey, I wasn't a weirdo. I was in the audio-visual club.
     Homer: Really? Me too! But I got kicked out 'cause of my views of
	    Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors.
-- Also because I didn't know what I was doing, "Homerpalooza"

% When Homer drinks beer to celebrate, though, his stomach echoes when
% he burps.  The manager, worried, slaps his stomach and the same
% echoic sound occurs.

Homer, nothing's more important to me than the health and well-being of
my freaks. I'm sending you to a vet.
-- Hullabalooza manager, "Homerpalooza"

% The veterinarian diagnoses that the cannonballs have demolished
% Homer's stomach.  Among other things, he strongly encourages Homer
% not to get hit by another cannonball.

Homer: Pftt... Rules. I'm a rocker, I don't care for rules.
  Vet: Mr. Simpson, this is serious. If you take one more cannonball to
       the gut, you will die.
Homer: Die? Well, you don't scare me, doc, 'cause dying would be a
       stone groove. Got any messages for Jimi Hendrix?
  Vet: Yes: "Pick up your puppy."
	[pan to Rover Hendrix]
-- And play better shuffleboard, "Homerpalooza"

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 15'24"]

% Back at home, Homer is the subject of Bart's attention.

 Bart: So, what's it like being famous, dad?
Homer: People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great.
-- Basic mantra of the prestigious, "Homerpalooza" 

 Bart: Do you wear boxers or briefs?
Homer: [checking] Nope.
 Bart: What religion are you?
Homer: You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't
       work out in real life. Uh... Christianity.
-- "Homerpalooza"

% Homer wonders why all those questions, but Bart avoids the subject by
% saying it's "just some report [he's] gotta do for school", and offers
% him a piece of pie. While he's away, Homer takes a look at Bart's
% paper, which is about the person he admires most: his father. When
% Bart comes back, they eat their pie silently, sharing this moment,
% but the rumbling from Homer's stomach reminds him of the price he
% could pay.
%
% At Springfield Fairgrounds, the family is allowed access to the
% backstage of Hullabalooza.

Guard: Clear the way, clear the way! Performer coming through.
Marge: This is so exciting. Last time I got to go backstage was when

 Bart: Mom...
   DJ: [pointing to Bart] Ha-ha!
-- Cypress Hill takes a cue from Muntz, "Homerpalooza"

% Once backstage, it's time for the last-minute preparations...

Who is playing with the London Symphony Orchestra? Come on people,
somebody ordered the London Symphony Orchestra... posssibly while high.
-- Backstage at Hullabalooza, "Homerpalooza"

% Most signs point at Cypress Hill, so they take the orchestra:

       DJ: Uh, do you know "Insane in the Brain"?
Violinist: [British accent] We mostly know classical... but we could

	    [hip-hop music, gradually accompanied by the orchestra]
	   "Put the water on the flame, boiling temper"
	   "Just toss that ham in the frying pan like spam..."
-- Mmm... spam, "Homerpalooza"

% On stage, Peter Frampton uses a synthesized voice to create the
% illusion that his guitar "talks" while playing.

     Jimbo: Man, that guy's guitar is talking.
      Otto: Hey, my shoes are talking too!
 Left Shoe: Don't worry. We won't hurt you.
Right Shoe: We only want to have some fun.

% There are even some spectators you wouldn't expect...

   Burns: [chuckles] And to think, Smithers: you laughed when I bought
	  TicketMaster. "Nobody's going to pay a 100% service charge."
Smithers: Well, it's a policy that ensures a healthy mix of the rich
	  and the ignorant, sir.
-- Burns attends Hullabalooza, "Homerpalooza"

% Back on stage, Frampton's having some problems with his show, as his
% "pig" pedal doesn't do anything.

Frampton: God. Homer Simpson wrecks my pig, Cypress Hill steals my

	  you kids!
   Moore: Aw, come on, Mr. Frampton. You're not gonna eat <all> that

Frampton: Please, I'm trying to perform!
 Shelley: Go ahead. We'll stay here and guard your cooler.

-- "Homerpalooza"

% Discouraged, Frampton leaves the stage to Homer.

And now, Springfield, this is the moment that you've been waiting for,

% As the cannon fuse burns, everybody is paralyzed in anticipation of
