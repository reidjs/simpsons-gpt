% It's another lazy day, and Homer's doing what we all want to do -- laze
% around on the couch with a bowl of popcorn resting soundly on our chest,

Marge: [sighs] Hmmm... is this all we're going to do today?
Homer: [happily] Aaaaabsolutely.

-- Positively, "Realty Bites"

Marge: You know, Homer, I'm starting to realise -- life is short.
Homer: [intrigued] It is?
Marge: We have to make the most of the time we have!
Homer: [sits up, worried] We do?
Marge: Otherwise we could wake up one day and realise we've wasted our

Homer: Pff. <Friends> of the library?
-- That's a typo, "Realty Bites"

Marge: Oooh, ooh! There's an azalea festival at the public garden!
Homer: [uninterested] I went yesterday.

Homer: [hurt] Lenny really wanted to go!
-- Perhaps he's not lying, "Realty Bites"

Marge: I don't want a drug boat!
Homer: Well, I bet theres drug dresses, and drug vacuum cleaners, too!
-- Homer's new obsession, "Realty Bites"

% Chief Wiggum is about to begin the auction.

 Wiggum: All right, listen up.

Skinner: Then what happened to Johnny D?
 Wiggum: He forgot to lock 'em.
-- "Realty Bites"

Wiggum: Now, what am I bid?
   Guy: One kilo!
Wiggum: Sold.
-- Drug everything, "Realty Bites"

% In the prison, Johnny D and Snake are watching the auction from a barred

Homer: I don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat!
Marge: I found this hat!
Homer: Then what are you complaining about! You got yours... [pats seat.]
-- "Realty Bites"

% Marge reluctantly gets into the car, and Homer speeds away so fast Marge's
% hat flies off.  Within no time, Homer is speeding the car down the road and
% drives wrecklessly. It's a good job Chief Wiggum's back at the auction.

Marge: Homer... be careful!
Homer: Oh yeah, you gotta be careful.. when you do a trick like this!
       [tips the car so it drives on two wheels.]
--No.. I meant buckle your safety belt! "Realty Bites"

-- Lionel Hutz, realty salesman, "Realty Bites"

 Marge: Mr. Hutz! I didn't know you sold real estate!
Lionel: You didn't? We should talk more often, Marge. You see, the law
        business is a little slow, and since most of my clients wind up
        losing their houses, this was a natural move for me.
 Marge: Helping people find homes.. that must be really rewarding!
Lionel: Yes, the money <is> good, but the beauty is, you get to stay in
        the house until it's sold! [to a bunch of dogs] C'mon guys, lets
        go for a swim. [they run into the house]
-- Troy likes fish, now Lionel is swimming with dogs, "Realty Bites"

% Meanwhile, outside Moes, Homer is showing off his new car to Moe and

Homer: Oh yeah, I'm a real expert.
  Moe: What is that, a six barrel holleykauf?
Homer: You betcha!
  Moe: Pedal block intakes?
Homer: Nothing but.
  Moe: Miya half lifters?
Homer: Ah yeah.
  Moe: I made that last one up!
Homer: I see.

 Bart: Of course, we'll have to cut back on our own homework!
-- And that would be a shame, wouldn't it, "Realty Bites"

What in the heck is a <dwelling>?
-- Marge, "Realty Bites"

% Soon enough, Marge is practicing her sales techniques on Bart and Lisa, who
% are posing as a married couple. They're dressed for the occasion, wearing
% fancy clothes that don't fit.

Marge: So, you're married, and you're looking for your house, Mr. and Mrs...
 Bart: Superman!
 Lisa: Oh! Don't listen to my husband, he's just an idiot.  Now, I'm a
       vetinerarian, and I need to keep lots of sick animals in my house! Is
       that permitted?
 Bart: Not in my damn house!
Marge: Well, this neighbourhood is zone R3, which allows dogs, cats, phone
       answering monkeys, and... ohhh... [checks book] I'll <never> memorize
       all this!
 Lisa: When I had to learn about the Magna Carta, I made up a song! [singing]
       In 1215 at Ronnie Mee, do da do da, the nobles and the king agreed, oh
       da doo da day!
 Bart: We should have lived together first!
-- Practicing for Marge's real estate license test, "Realty Bites"

% Later, they've come up with the song, and are singing it to Homer.

B&L&M: Oh, on the closing day, the esker agents pay, taxes, lins and interest
       too, thanks to Penny May!
 Bart: They back your baaaaank!
Homer: You're all nuts.
-- Bingo, "Realty Bites"

% Marge is sitting the test, and nearly gets stuck on a question, but then
% she hums the song, and gets the answer. The alarm tings, and the test is
% over.

% The supervisor leaves. Captain McAllistar turns around to Marge.

Darr, I nailed that one about house-boats, did you?

% Homer drives the kids in his new car, wrecklessly as ever. They slide back
% and forth across the back seats due to the absence of seatbelts. Marge sits
% in the front with Homer, as they drive to see Marge's new billboard.

 Lisa: Agh, dad! Doesn't this car have seatbelts?
Homer: Seatbelts, pff! They kill more people than they save!
 Lisa: That's not true, you're thinking of airbags!
-- Or dashboards, "Realty Bites"

% They arrive at Marge's Red Blazer Realty billboard. Something looks
% different about her, though -- her butt looks big.

Marge: There it is!
  L&B: Wow!
 Lisa: Your own billboard!
 Bart: Check it out!
Homer: Gee, that picture makes your butt look big!
Marge: I thought so, too! But they said it sells.
 Bart: Works for the Lumber King.

% Later on, Marge is moving from house to house, inquiring as to whether the

Marge: No..

Dr. Hibbert: Why, isn't this kitcen horribly cramped? [laughs]
             [Opens oven door, which is so close to the cupboards that it's
              unable to open fully.]
      Marge: Why, yes it is.
Dr. Hibbert: Well, I suppose we could get used to it.
      Marge: Yeah, but you shouldn't have to settle... you know, I've always
             loved the house you're in now!
Dr. Hibbert: Really?  Well... maybe we should stay put!  Thanks for your

       Marge: You bowl often?
Sideshow Mel: Actually, this is our first time, and I didn't really care for

       Marge: Oh, well, then you have to ask yourself, is this the right
              house for you?

% In the Red Blazer Realty office, Lionel Hutz approaches Marge.

Lionel: Marge, I had a lot of calls about you! Customers love your "no

 Marge: Well, like we say, "the right house for the right person!"
Lionel: Listen, it's time I let you in on a little secret, Marge.  The
        right house is the house that's for sale. The right person is
        anyone.
-- Well, that makes things a lot simpler, "Realty Bites"

 Marge: But all I did was tell the truth!
Lionel: Of course you did. But theres.. [face becomes unfriendly, voice

 Marge: That's a beauty!
Lionel: [closes book] Forget about that house, that's the murder house.
 Marge: Ooh, I remember! Mrs. Astor was very lucky.
Lionel: Well, no one expects you to sell that house. But you'd better sell
        something, because cubicles are for closers, Marge. Anybody that
        doesn't sell a house their first week gets fired. I probably should
        have mentioned that earlier.
-- Indeed. "Realty Bites"

% At the dinner table, Marge is discussing the job.

Marge: Hm! So that's how you see me? As a spineless, potato-cooking housewife
       who can't compete in the real world?
  All: Mmm hm.
Marge: Well, I too can compete, and I'm gonna sell a house, end of story!
Homer: Kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. Why don't we let her

% House!  Maude inquires about it, and Marge reluctantly takes the Flanders'
% inside to look around. They walk through the roomy and echoey hallway into
% the interior rooms. It seems like the perfect deal.

  Ned: Oh! My d-iddly-ie, will you <look> at this place! [gasp] And the price
       has been <slashed> repeatedly!
Maude: It's sure built solid. The kids could scream <bloody murder> and

Maude: Is there anything else we should know, Marge?
       [Marge remember's Lionel Hutz's "the truth" conversation. She then

Marge: No, there is absolutely nothing else to tell you about this house.
  Ned: That's good enough for me!

 Bart: Yeah, you did the right thing.. eventually.
Marge: Still, it would've been nice to bring home at least one paycheck.
Homer: Oh, you will, honey... [Homer steers into the Springfield Office of
       Unemployment] ... you will!
-- Quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers, "Realty Bites"

% In the unemployment office, we see several familiar faces. Marge is at
% the front of the queue.

      Marge: Three hundred dollars for doing nothing? I feel like such a
             crook!
George Bush: Don't worry. Gets easier every week.
-- Damn you, George Bush, "Realty Bites"

% OFF smile for the camera, as cheesy music plays.

% Fin.
