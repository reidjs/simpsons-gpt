%
% Lisa and Maggie sit at the kitchen table.  (There is a one-eared rabbit
% doll on the table in front of Lisa, and a smaller two-eared variety in
% front of Maggie.)  Bart walks in, hiccuping.

L: Look, Nurse Maggie, our new patient.
B: [moans]  [in pain] I've got the hiccups, and I've got 'em bad... [moans]

% Lisa produces a blender.

L: Nurse Maggie, begin preparation of the secret hiccup elixir.

% As Lisa calls out each ingredient, Maggie slides it down the table,
% and Lisa empties the bottle/jar/can into the blender.  Bart can only
% watch, fearing the worst.  (Hiccuping occasionally.)

L: Milk... Ice cream... Maple syrup... Cream of broccoli [splort]...
   Hot sauce.

% Lisa puts the top on the blender and turns it on.

B: No way, man!

% Maggie comes up behind Bart and yanks his head backwards, forcing
% his mouth wide open.  Lisa empties the entire brownish-purple contents
% of the blender into Bart's mouth.  Maggie lets go, and Bart's head
% snaps back into place.

B: [moan]  [burp]

% Bart collapses on his back.  (*hiccup*)

L: I knew it.  Not enough hot sauce.

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:23]

L: Climb into the treatment apparatus, please.

% Lisa stands by a swivel chair in the living room.  Bart stands (*hiccup*)
% in front of the chair, and Maggie shoves him into the seat.  The girls
% grab a hold of the chair and give it a huge spin.  (Maggie falls in the
% process.)

L: [whispers]  Confidentially, Nurse Maggie, this treatment has occasional
   side-effects.

% The girls stop the chair from spinning.  Bart, clearly disoriented, moans
% and hiccups out of the chair and staggers all around the room.

L: [whispers]  The side effects are somewhat entertaining, are they not,
   Nurse Maggie?

% Bart collapses.  (*hiccup*)
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:40]
%
% Bart leans against the wall, still hiccuping.  Lisa and Maggie stand
% nearby, each touching their cheek with their right hand, and holding
% their right elbow in their left hand.  (Maggie is obviously mimicking
% her older sister.)  Throughout, Bart hiccups, moans, hiccups again,
% moans again, etc.

L: I'm stumped, Nurse Maggie.  This is the worst case of the hiccups
   we've ever treated.

% Maggie mimes her suggestion:  She pulls her head back and pushes
% up her hair into a likeness of Bart, and mimes being force-fed.
% Then she takes her pacifier in her hand and spins it.  Then she
% pulls her hair back and contorts her face into a likeness of Homer.

L: That's it!  A combination of our previous techniques, followed by
   the scare treatment.  It can't miss.

% In the kitchen, Maggie pulls Bart's head back as Lisa pours the
% elixir down his throat.
%
% Back in the living room, the girls spin Bart (Maggie falls again),
% and while Bart is spinning, Maggie produces a photo of Homer.  Lisa
% stops the chair, and Bart screams in fright when he sees the picture.

L: I pronounce this patient... cured!

% Bart oozes to the floor and hiccups.
