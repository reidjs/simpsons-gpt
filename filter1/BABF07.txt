% Just then, Bart and Lisa hear Milhouse yelling outside.  They go to the
% window and see a bright beam of light chasing him.  He pounds on the door
% until they let him in.  Lisa asks Milhouse if he's okay.  Although his
% vision is greatly impaired, he calmly states that he's been better.
%
% Later Bart and Milhouse lie around, not knowing what to do.

Bart:     Oh, I am *so* bored!
Milhouse: Oh, I can't wait 'til we're teenagers; then we'll be happy.
Lisa:     [looking in the closet] Well, we could play Clam Traffic Jam or The
          Game of County Seats.  [opens box] Aw, the zoning disk is warped!
Bart:     [walks to closet] Alright!  Silly String!  [sprays glasses and
          eyebrows on Lisa] Look, you're Milhouse!
Milhouse: Who wets their bed now, Milhouse?  [chuckles]
Lisa:     Ugh, I'll be in my room.

% Milhouse and Bart inspect the closets in Homer and Marge's bedroom looking
% for something to do.  When Milhouse finds a box of wigs, he suggests they
% dress up like ladies.  Bart hesitantly responds, "Wouldn't that make us kind
% of fruity?"  Milhouse, donning a wig and bra, calls Bart afraid.  Not one to
% take an insult, Bart puts on a dress and is impressed with how well it hides
% his thighs.
%
% Soon, Bart and Milhouse are fully dressed as women and are jumping on Bart's
% parents' bed.  Homer tries to come in and is surprised to find the door
% locked.  Startled, Bart falls off the bed and his rear lands on a bowling
% ball.  Then, Homer gets the door open.

Homer:    What's going on?!  [threateningly] And I want a non-gay explanation!
Milhouse: Uh ... we're drunk.  Really drunk.
Homer:    Oh, thank God.

% At the hospital, Bart is closely monitored as Dr. Hibbert defibrillates
% Bart's buttocks.

Marge:   Why are you doing that?
Hibbert: Oh, it's good for the batteries.  Now, I'm afraid your son has
         cracked his coccyx.
         [Lisa, Marge, and Homer laugh]
Marge:   Sorry.  How long will he take to recover?
Hibbert: He'll have to wear this fanny cast for quite some time [he slides it
         on], but don't worry, son, it fits snugly under your clothes.
         [pulls down a chart showing a boy wearing cast.  His butt bulges
         out by a good twelve inches]
Bart:    Do all these people have to watch me?

% At school, Bart has trouble getting up the front stairs in his wheelchair
% and winds up tipping over.  Lisa comes over to help.

Skinner:  Bart, stop fooling around.
Lisa:     Principal Skinner, I thought public schools were required to have
          access ramps for the disabled.
Skinner:  Technically, yes, but the building costs would be astronomical.
Fat Tony: [emerges from behind a tree] Did I hear the word "astronomical"?  If
          so, my construction outfit "Valdezzo Brothers Olive Oil" is poised
          to help.
Skinner:  No, no, no, no.  We're not building anything.
Fat Tony: How can you say that when construction has already begun?
          [construction workers arrive and start massive construction]
Skinner:  How did those trucks get here so fast?!
Fat Tony: In order to avoid certain legal complications, the trucks are always
          rolling.  Now for the groundbreaking ceremony.
          [Fat Tony and Principal Skinner hold a golden shovel for a picture]
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% After much more construction, complicated cloverleaves of ramps are built
% all around the school building.  Principal Skinner talks to Fat Tony.

Skinner:  Good Lord!  Do we really need all those ramps?!
Fat Tony: Who's to say?  Does a peacock need all those feathers?
Skinner:  Look, you're getting a little philosophical for me.
Fat Tony: I suppose so.  They say it happens in the autumn years.
Skinner:  [leaning against a car] Well, be that as it may--
Fat Tony: Get your hand off my car.
          [Skinner promptly does]
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Finally, it's time for the grand opening of the ramps.  Skinner addresses
% the townspeople who have gathered to witness it.

Skinner:  This is a proud day.  Now when people ask if we're in compliance the
          Americans with Disabilities Act of 1975, I can say, we are closer
          than ever before!
          [Crowd cheers]
          Thank you!  To inaugurate our ramp system, here's the first of what
          I hope will be many disabled students, Bart Simpson!
          [The crowd cheers again as Bart *walks* to the front]
          What the...?  Bart, where's your wheelchair?!
Bart:     Don't need it anymore.  Doctor says my butt bone's stronger than
          ever!  [repeatedly rams his butt into the sidewalk] Ta-da!
          [scattered applause]
Skinner:  Well, at least we're prepared for the new millennium!  [pats a ramp,
          causing the entire system to crumble to the ground; picks up some
          rubble]  My God, the whole thing's made of breadsticks!
          [Seagulls start eating the remains of the ramps]
Fat Tony: And paint and shellac.  It's all itemized in this bill.  [hands
          Skinner an invoice on which is written "Two Hundred G's Thank You!

Skinner: Now you keep asking me that, and I keep telling you "over there".
         [At a table some cooks prepare food]

Skinner: As for the school, we are exploring various options to raise the

Ned:     I've got a motor home I never use; maybe we should raffle it off.
Homer:   [eating food] Maybe you should shut up.
Ned:     Well, I ... okay.  [sits down]
Moe:     We could try selling liquor; I'm doing great!
Skinner: Please, sir!  Put some shoes on!
Moe:     What, you don't like my bags?  [he's wearing bread bags for shoes]
Skinner: [groan] People, these are all good ideas--
Marge:   No, they're not.  They're terrible, terrible ideas.
Skinner: You're right.  It's hopeless.  No one has that kind of money.
Marge:   What about Mr. Burns?  Maybe *he'll* help us out.
Homer:   [stuffing food in his pants] Forget it.  He releases the hounds on
         every charity that comes to his door -- Feed the Children, Save the
         Whales, even Release the Hounds.
Skinner: Well, maybe we can pry open his wallet with a slick, professional

Nelson:  Hmm ... which one of these is the salt?  Too bad I'm an idiot 'cause
         my school closed.  Oh, well.  [pours the poison in the pot]
Burns:   No!!  That's the rat poison!
Skinner: And, freeze!  Now, who in Springfield will eat the poisoned broth?
         Oh-ho! It could be anyone, even Mr. Burns!
Burns:   This play really speaks to me.
         [Next, Bart drives a Mr. Burns dummy around in an ambulance]
Bart:    I can't take Mr. Burns to the ho'pital 'cause I'm too dumb to read a

Burns:   Hmm....
         [Bart gets Mr. Burns to the hospital where Ralph, as a doctor, puts

Ralph:   Hello, I'm Dr. Stupid.  I'm going to take out your liver bones.

          I'm with Jim Hope of Kid First Industries, which has generously
          stepped in to educate our children.
Jim Hope: That's right, Kent.  You know, when public schools drop the ball,
          it's up to the private sector to fall on that fumble and run for the
          end zone.
Brockman: Will you be replacing the current teachers and administrators?
Jim Hope: Very much so, Kent, but they've already received and extremely
          generous severance package.

Bart:   Boogers.

Jim:    [laughing strangely loudly] Boogers!  Ha ha ha ha!  That was great!
        You know, humor is a sign of intelligence.

Homer: Get 'em, boy!  Hit those smart-ass books!
Marge: Why don't you kick some books, Lisa?
Lisa:  Bart broke all my books.

Marge: Boy, that sounds fun!
Bart:  I know, but I'm still not gonna do it.

% Back at the school, Jim Hope's classroom is decorated with Christmas stuff.

Jim Hope: Since Christmas is coming soon, I thought we could talk about our

Milhouse: My Busy Box!  It's got everything!  [turning steering wheel] Vroom!
          Vroom, vroom!  [dialing phone] I'm calling Daddy!
Jim Hope: Good for you, not being bound by the recommended age.
Milhouse: What are you talking about?  [reads "ages 2-4"] Oh, jeez!
Jim Hope: How 'bout the rest of you?  What do you like about those toys of
          yours?
Sherri:   [holding doll] They're special.
Nelson:   They're challenging.  [cranks jack-in-the-box for a while]
Jim Hope: Very good.  Now I want you all to imagine the perfect toy.  What
          would it be like?
Terri:    [holding stuffed animal] It should be soft and cuddly.
Bart:     Yeah, with lots of firepower.
Milhouse: Its eyes should be telescopes!  No, periscopes!  No, microscopes!
          Can you come back to me?
Nelson:   It should be full of surprises.
Milhouse: It should never stop dancing.
Martin:   It should need accessories.

% door.

Bart: [chuckles] Lisa's in trouble.  Ha!  The ironing is delicious.
Lisa: The word is "irony".
Bart: Huh?
Lisa: Don't you think there's something weird going on here?  We spent all day
      selecting fabric swatches, and then our guest speaker was Phil from
      marketing.
Bart: All's I know is I'm getting straight A's, and that ain't not bad!
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% On the way out of the classroom, Bart switches the light off and cackles.
% Lisa then notices light seeping in from the edge of the chalkboard.  She
% looks through the crack and sees the hidden research office.  In the

Ralph:  [over radio] Daddy, I'm ready to get out now.  Over.
        [They arrive at the "broom closet" door]
Lisa:   This broom closet is not what it seems.  It's a secret surveillance
        room guarded by a tiny evil robot!
Homer:  Ugh.  Is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open
        the door and everything's normal and we think you're crazy, but then
        there really *is* a killer robot and the next morning you find me
        impaled on a weather vane?  Is that what this is, Lisa?!
Marge:  To be fair, not all evil robots are killers.
Lisa:   Listen, when you see what's inside-- [opens the door and a mop falls
        on her head; inside are only normal things you would find in a closet]
        I don't understand; I could swear it was right here!
Wiggum: Yeah, right, mop top, and I'm Ed Sullivan.  [ahem] Really big shoe.

Lisa:    Lets just agree that the commercialization of Christmas is, at best,
         a mixed blessing.
Coleman: Amen.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Then a bare robot Funzo emerges from the fire and Gary Coleman thoroughly
% beats it up.  Bart comments, "Well there's something you don't see every
% Christmas", reminding everyone what day it is.  The Simpsons are about to
% go home when they see Gary Coleman standing all by himself.  Bart whispers
% an idea to Homer, who nods and walks over to Coleman.

Homer:   Um, uh, Mr. Coleman, I've been thinkin', uh, my wife always makes too
         much stuffing and sweet pertaters and all and ... oh, heck, would you
         like to spend Christmas with us?
Coleman: No way.  I'm having Christmas at George Clooney's house.  [adjusts
         tie and hair]
Lisa:    Gary ...
Coleman: Alright, I'll come.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Mr. Burns and Smithers join the Simpsons and Gary Coleman in the Simpsons'
% dining room.

Narr.:   And Gary Coleman was as good as his word, and as for old Mr. Burns,
         he was visited by three ghosts during the night and agreed to fund
         the school with some money he found in his tuxedo pants.
         [The Simpsons applaud]
Burns:   Thank you, thank you!  Humbug.
Narr.:   While Moe, seeing what the world would be like if he had never been
         born, pulled his head out of the oven and replaced it with a plump
         Christmas goose.
         [Moe delivers the goose at the Simpsons' table]
Moe:     Yeah, happy holidays, there.
All:     Merry Christmas, Moe!
Moe:     Uh, listen, I kinda banged up that Jeep in the driveway.
Coleman: Whatchu talkin' about, Moe?
         [All laugh, then turn to face the audience]
         Whatchu talkin' 'bout, everyone?
