% It's another peaceful night in Springfield.  Our favorite family are
% nestled, all snug in their beds, when a shadow falls on the front
% door.  A man approaches with a suitcase which he places on the
% doorstep and opens to reveal a large number of tools.  He seems intent
% on breaking into the front door, but he doesn't need to: Homer has
% left his keys in the lock.
%
% Santa's Little Helper growls at the intruder, but he has anticipated
% this: he hands the dog some sausages, and the dog whimpers and begins
% to eat them.  Homer wanders in, apparently still asleep, and the
% intruder holds out some sausages to him too.  He sniffs them, says
% "Mmm!", and begins to eat them, still asleep and standing up.
%
% The man enters Lisa's room first.  He pulls back her covers to reveal
% that she sleeps with her saxophone at her lips.  With each exhale, she
% plays the note E. The man deftly exchanged her saxophone for a party
% favor.  Lisa doesn't notice the difference.
%
% In Bart's room, the man pulls back his covers and finds Bart with the
% portable TV under his arm.  Again, the intruder takes in and places a
% copy of a "Coping With Loss" book in the boy's arms.  Bart mutters a
% little, but he doesn't awaken.
%
% Lastly, the man steals Marge's red pearl necklace.  She's been wearing
% it for so long that each bead makes a popping noise as he pulls it
% loose.  The intruder sneaks out of the house past Santa's Little
% Helper and Homer, who are still asleep in the front hallway.
%
% The next morning, Homer and the dog haven't moved.

 Bart: Dad...we've been robbed!
 Lisa: Wake up, Dad, wake up!  There was a burglar and he took my
       saxophone!
Homer: Woo-hoo!
 Bart: And our portable TV!
Homer: D'oh!
Marge: And my necklace!
Homer: Ehh, that's no big loss.
Marge: Homer, that necklace was a priceless Bouvier family heirloom.
Homer: Oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em.
Marge: Well, yes I do.  But they're all heirlooms too.
-- The morning after the burglar's visit, "Homer the Vigilante"

  Bart: [upset] The burglar even took my stamp collection.
  Lisa: _You_ had a stamp collection?
         [Homer, Marge, and Lisa laugh their heads off]
         [The phone rings; Bart answers it]
Nelson: Stamp collection?  Ha ha!
-- News travels fast, "Homer the Vigilante"

 Lisa: Bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't.  That saxophone was my one
       creative outlet.  It was the only way I could truly express
       myself.
Homer: Shh, quiet, Lisa.
-- "Homer the Vigilante"

% Bart observes that the burglar has left his business card.  Marge
% reads it: "'You have just been robbed by the Springfield Cat
% Burglar'...cute."  Just then, Flanders walks in.

Flanders: Heidely-ho, neighborinos!
   Homer: Can't talk.  Robbed.  Go hell.
Flanders: Heh.  You folks got robbed too?  The burglar took my Shroud of
          Turin beach towels.
    Bart: Wow, it's a crime wave!
-- Misplaced adoration, "Homer the Vigilante"

% Principal Skinner is despondent that day as well.  "Good Lord!" he
% exclaims, "My Stormin' Norman commemorative plates stolen!...again."
% {Barney wakes up in the middle of his floor, naked, in an empty
% apartment.  "Hey, I thought I had more stuff than this."}

 Lisa: {We _are_ insured, aren't we, Mom?}
Marge: {Homer, tell your child what you bought when I sent you to town
       to get some insurance.}
Homer: {Curse you, magic beans!}
Marge: {Oh, stop blaming the beans.}
-- "Homer the Vigilante"

% Homer decides to report the robbery to the Springfield police.

 Homer: Hello, Police?  Are you sitting down?  Good!  I wish to report a
        robbery.
Wiggum: [bored] A robbery, right.  Thanks for the report.  [hangs up]
        That's _another_ one, Lou...723 Evergreen Terrace.
         [Looks at a map with the robbery locations marked on it]
        Well, there doesn't seem to be any pattern yet, but if I take
        this one and move it here...and I move these over here...hello!
        It _almost_ looks like an arrow!
   Lou: Hey, look, Chief: it's pointing right at this police station.
Wiggum: Let's get out of here!
-- Deduction at its finest, "Homer the Vigilante"

% The Springfield Shopper announces the news of the burglary in its
% headlines.  Kent Brockman reports on the bad news.

     Kent: When cat burglaries start, can mass murders be far behind?
           This reporter isn't saying that the burglar is an inhuman
           monster like the Wolfman, but he very well could be.  So,
           professor: would you say it's time for everyone to panic?
Professor: Yes I would, Kent.
-- Reasoned judgement, "Homer the Vigilante"

% At a press conference, Chief Wiggum reports on the police's progress.

Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen -- please.  We have a major
break in the case.  We recovered the burglar's hankerchief from one of
the crime scenes.  Now, one sniff of this baby, and our tracking dog
will be hot on his trail.
Gosh, look at me, I'm...sweating like a pig here.  [wipes himself] Oh...
aw man...that's better.
All right, get the scent, boy.  [dog sniffs it] Come on, get the scent.
Now kill!
 [Dog jumps at his throat]
Oh!  Ow!  Hey!  Oh, my jugular, argh!  Ooh!  Any questions?
-- Chief Wiggum at the press conference, "Homer the Vigilante"

% Professor John Frink has even come up with a plan to foil the burglar:
% a house that runs away on giant feet when the burglar trips the alarm.
% His miniature demonstration model trips and falls, however, bursting
% into flames.  Little wooden people fall out of the house, burning.
% "The real humans won't, er, wo -- won't burn quite so fast," he
% consoles sheepishly.
%
% {As Bart walks down the street the next day, many bars automatically
% slam shut in front of windows.  He stops in front of one house and
% says, "Cool: high-tech security system!"  He tosses a pebble at the
% house, and two lasers follow its course while a third one blasts the
% pebble to dust.  The house next door gets up on two giant legs and
% begins running away from Bart, but it trips and bursts into flame.}
%
% {The house with the lasers draws all the neighborhood kids.  They toss
% stones at it and watch them getting destroyed.  "All right!" grooves
% Otto, "Free laserium!  All the colors of the 'bow, man!"  Just then,
% Jasper walks by and gets zapped in the eyes by a laser.}

        {[a laser hits Jasper in the eyes]
Jasper: Oh!...my cataracts are gone.  I can see again!  All the beauty
        of na --
         [Another laser hits him in the eyes]
        I'm blind.  Oh well: easy come, easy go.}
-- Jasper's nonchalance over sight, "Homer the Vigilante"

% At the Springfield Retirement Home, Abe sleeps.  His door opens and a
% shadow appears at it.

   Abe: Oh!  It's the Cat Burglar.  Please don't kill me!
Malloy: Abe, can I borrow your ointment?
   Abe: Oh, it's you, Malloy.  All right -- but this time, clean off the
        applicator!
-- A close call, "Homer the Vigilante"

% Apu is even frightened: when a man drives up to the Kwik-E-Mart and
% gets out of his car, Apu takes a shot at him with a shotgun from his
% perch atop the roof of the building.  The man hurries off, and Apu
% shouts after him, "Thank you for coming.  I'll see you in Hell."
%
% Homer decides to lay down some new rules for the family.

Homer: All right: these are our new family security rules.  Be home
       before dark, and make sure you're not followed.  Lock all doors
       and windows.
Marge: And don't take candy from strangers.
Homer: [plaintive] Marge, they're only human!
-- "Homer the Vigilante"

 Lisa: What's the point of all these precautions?  I've already lost the
       only thing that matters to me.
Homer: Oh, Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone.  I got you another
       instrument.
 Lisa: What, this jug?
        [She blows its spout, producing two alternating tones in rhythm]
        [Homer begins to laugh and cheer, but Lisa stops]
Homer: Lisa, never _ever_ stop in the middle of a hoedown!
-- "Homer the Vigilante"

% Lisa starts to cry.  Homer says, "Oh honey, I didn't realize how much
% that horn meant to you.  Don't worry; Daddy's going to get it back.  I
% don't know how, but I'll figure out something."  Lisa thanks him.
% Homer continues, "You know, Lisa, music helps Daddy think."  She
% starts blowing the jug again, and Homer dances in place while
% thinking.
%
% The Springfield Shopper asks rhetorically, "Is Nothing Safe?"
% Apparently the answer is no: the Cat Burglar steals the paper, leaving
% his business card in its place.  Flanders has a meeting in his rumpus
% room.

Flanders: Welcome, neighbors.  Since the police can't seem to get off
          their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, I
          think it's time we started our own neighborhood watch...
          eroony!
           [Everyone cheers]
          Now, who should lead the group?
     Man: You!
Everyone: Yay!  Flanders!  Flanders!  Flanders!
Flanders: I don't really have very much experience, but I'll --
     Moe: Someone else!
Everyone: Yay!  Someone else!  Someone else!  Someone else!
   Homer: _I'm_ someone else.
   Lenny: He's right!
   Homer: We don't need a thinker.  We need a doer: someone who'll act
          without considering the consequences.
Everyone: Homer!  Homer!  Homer!
-- How quickly they sway, "Homer the Vigilante"

    Barney: I'm with you, Homer!
McAllister: I be with ya too, matey.
   Skinner: I'm with you, Homer.
       Moe: You're the man, Homer.
       Apu: You should do it.
      Otto: You're the man, man.
       Abe: I'll join!  I'm filled with piss and vinegar.  At first I
            was just filled with vinegar.
     Homer: Hmm...sorry, Dad.  You're too old.
       Abe: [stammers] Too old?  Why, that just means I have experience.
            Who chased the Irish out of Springfield village in aught
            four?  Me, that's who!
 Irish man: And a fine job you did, too.
     Homer: Aw, Dad.  You've done a lot of great things, but you're a
            very old man now, and old people are useless.  [tickles Abe]
            Aren't they?  Aren't they?  Huh?  Yes they are!  Yes they
            are!  Tee hee --
       Abe: Stop it!  That's a form of abuse.
-- Father and son, "Homer the Vigilante"

% Moe, Homer, McAllister, and Skinner all check out their own shotguns
% in the Simpson home.

     Marge: I don't think the guns are a good idea.
     Homer: Marge!  We're responsible adults.  And --

% The men check out the display of weapons at Herman's store.  {The shot

Herman: So...wedding, huh?
 Homer: No, we're forming a vigilante group.
-- An easy mistake to make, "Homer the Vigilante"

% Herman entreats Homer to go with him.

 Herman: See, it's a miniature version of the A-Bomb.  The government
         built it in the fifties to drop on beatniks.
          [Homer imagines a beatnik on the grass with a bongo]

 Herman: Hey...see the sign?  ["Do not ride the bomb"]
  Homer: Sorry.
-- Eradication of undesirables, "Homer the Vigilante"

% The vigilante group is now outfitted and ready to go.  Homer inspects
% their uniforms.

  Homer: OK, men, it's time to clean up this town!
Skinner: Meaning what, exactly?
  Homer: You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big.
-- A noble directive, "Homer the Vigilante"

% Homer gets in a motorcycle sidecar with Barney as the driver, and he
% demands that Bart give him his megaphone.  "It's not just _a_
% megaphone, Dad, it's a Rapmaster 2000," Bart explains, but Homer grabs
% it nonetheless, figuring he must whip the neighborhood into shape.  As
% he uses it, a beat emanates from it under his voice, and the
% neighborhood children mistake Homer for Hammer.  The follow the
% motorcycle, dancing and gyrating, ignoring Homer's warning to return
% to their homes and places of businesseses.
%
% On one of the patrols, the vigilante group come upon a college student
% playing a saxophone for money on the street.

  Homer: Hey, you!  Where did you get that saxophone?
Student: [pause] Sears.
  Homer: Get him!
-- Mistaken identity, "Homer the Vigilante"

% On another patrol, they come across a man burning leaves in his yard.
% {The man takes a puff of his cigarette.}  "No burning leaves without a

% the burning leaves all around.  "I got one," the man protests, but it
% is too late.  The vigilantes run off, and the man has to douse the
% leaves before they burn his house to the ground.
%
% They come upon Jimbo who is spray painting "carpe diem" on a wall.

Homer: Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent.

 Kent: I see.  Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group
       has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?

-- On a silver platter, "Homer the Vigilante"

% Marge hops in the motorcycle and Homer in the sidecar while the other
% citizens of Springfield drive in whatever they can.  Barney flies a
% biplane with Selma and Patty in the other seats straight through a
% Duff billboard.  A man in a convertible drives in what he thought was
% a shallow stream, but his car gets lower and lower in the water.  Bart
% watches with a grin as the man sinks, and Bart waves goodbye.

% Kent Brockman reports on the situation.

     Kent: Hordes of panicky people seem to be evacuating the town for
           some unknown reason.  Professor, without knowing precisely
           what the danger is, would you say it's time for our viewers
           to crack each other's heads open and feast on the goo inside?
Professor: Mmm, yes I would, Kent.

% People arrive helter-skelter at the address given by Malloy.  It has a

Wiggum: [opens it] It's just a piece of paper.
 Homer: It's mine!  [reads] "Frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden

        jail.  Fondest wishes" -- oh, I can't make out the signature!
Quimby: Keep digging.  We're bound to find something!
-- Missing the point, "Homer the Vigilante"

% They do as Quimby suggests, until there are only a few of them at the
% bottom of a hole forty or fifty feet deep.

Quimby: I guess we're not going to find anything.
  Otto: Um, how are we going to get out of here?
 Homer: We'll dig our way out!
Wiggum: No, dig _up_, stupid.

% The theme music at the end has an oom-pah-pah bass, and it sounds more
% goofy than usual (this ties in with the "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad,
