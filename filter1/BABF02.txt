% It's morning, but like most of us, Homer isn't ready to face the 
% day.  He punches the "snooze" button on his alarm clock and catches 
% a few extra Zs.  Then a few more.  Then a lot more.  Homer stays 
% sound asleep as the clouds and the sun whirl by outside his window, 
% and the ebb and flow of people on their daily rounds surrounds him.

% work.

% In the kitchen Marge tries to feed Maggie.

Marge:	Num-num, Maggie, num-num.  [but she keeps dodging the 
	spoon]
Homer:	[running in] Did someone say num-num?
Marge:	I can't get Maggie to eat.  Maybe if you try ...
Homer:	Oh, I'm twenty-six hours late for work -- no time for 
	Maggie.
Maggie:	[looks disappointed]
Homer:	[notices a cereal box and picks it up] Ooh, Where's Waldo?  
	[looks] No, no -- this would be a lot easier without all 
	these people.  Nope, no [gasps] It's him!  No.
Marge:	Homer!
Homer:	Waldo, where are you?
	[as if on cue, Waldo walks past the kitchen window]
-- Oh, there he is, "Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder"

% The traffic isn't cooperating with Homer, with all the streets 
% jammed with traffic.  Homer takes a proactive approach and pulls 
% onto the median.  One of Springfield's finest pulls him over.

Wiggum:	All right, smart guy, where's the fire?
Homer:	Over there.  [points to the Springfield PD, which is in 
	flames]
Wiggum:	Okay, you just bought yourself a 317:  Pointing out police 
	stupidity.  Or is that a 314?  No, no, 314 is a dog, uh, 
	in, no, is that a 315?  You're in trouble, pal.

% Homer finally makes it to his workstation at the power plant.

Homer:		[chuckles] I'd hate to see the look on old Burnsie's 
		face if he knew I was just getting in.  [the camera 
		draws back to reveal that Burns and Smithers are 
		standing right behind him]
Burns:		[clears throat]
Homer:		[reaches behind him.  His hands find Mr. Burns' 
		face]  Hmm, who is that?  [feels around] Big ugly 
		nose ... bald ... liver spot ... liver spot, hmmm.
		[grabs Burns' dentures and pulls them free.  With a 
		cash register sound, a new set pops into Burns' 
		mouth]
Burns:		Turn around, Simpson.
Homer:		No!  I can't get in trouble if I can't see you.
Smithers:	I'm afraid he's got us, sir.

Marge:	Oh, no, not Lenny -- not Lenny!
Homer:	Yes, I'm going to have to work late instead of seeing you

-- Anyone but Lenny!  "Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder"

% But Lenny is safe and sound at the bowling alley, making up off-
% color initials for the automatic scoring machines.  He and Carl take 
% "POO" and "ASS," leaving Homer with nothing good.  Homer's so mad, 
% he sees Burns' face in his bowling ball, and takes out his 
% frustration by bowling the old man to a strike.
%

Carl:	Careful what you say, Lenny; you'll jinx him.
Lenny:	Oh, right, sorry.

	calling the waitress.  [to waitress] Ah, this split you 
	sold me is making me choke.
Homer:	Lenny!
Lenny:	What?  I paid 7.10 for this split.
Carl:	Will you at least call it a banana split, you dumbwad?
Lenny:	Hey, spare me your gutter-mouth.  [Homer strikes Lenny by 
	throwing a bowling ball at him]

% Despite Lenny's unwitting distraction, Homer continues to bowl 
% strikes.
%
% Meanwhile at Homer, the kids spend their afternoon with Krusty.  
% Springfield's favorite children's host addresses the camera.

Krusty:		Kids, today we have to talk about Krusty Brand Chew-
		Goo Gum-like Substance.  We knew it contained spider 
		eggs, but the Hantavirus, well, that really came out 
		of left field.  [At home, Bart blows a bubble.  When 
		it pops, dozens of tiny spiders run off]  So, if any 
		of you've experienced numbness, or comas, send proof

		Brockman, live from Barney's Bowl-A-Rama, where 
		local pinhead Homer Simpson is on the verge of a 
		perfect game.
Lisa:		Hey!  There was no accident at the plant.  Dad just 
		wanted to go bowling.
Marge:		He shouldn't have deceived me, but I'm just so 
		relieved Lenny's okay.
		[looks at a picture of Lenny, which has been set up, 
		along with a rose and a candle, on the end table]

Brockman:	This could be the greatest individual achievement in 
	the history of Springfield, which proves just how 
	pitiful this town is.
-- We needed proof of that?  "Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder"

% Homer is now just one strike away from the Holy Grail of bowling.  
% Marge, with the kids in tow, walks in the bowling alley and stands a 
% respectful distance away from Homer.

Marge:	Now listen, your father really needs to concentrate, so 
	we'll just stay here, and not disturb him.
Homer:	Why won't they come over?  I'm so lonely.
-- "Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder"

% Time seems to slow down for everyone as Homer lofts the ball toward 
% the pins.  (Everyone but Abe, for who slow motion is the only kind 
% of motion.)  The ball not only finds its mark, but sets off an 
% explosion that obliterates pins in several adjacent lanes.
%
% As the crowd cheers, two clerks each turn keys on their console, 
% releasing a perfect-game celebration balloon, which drifts slowly to 
% the floor.  Jubilant, Homer spikes his bowling ball.  It goes clean 
% through the floor, hitting some unfortunate person below.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:22]
%
% With the pressure off, Marge can congratulates her husband.  Homer 
% triumphantly scratches "Bowl perfect game" off his to-do list, and 
% then thanks the Big Man -- Carl.
%
% Bowling a perfect game has its perks, aside from the sheer 
% satisfaction of the achievement itself.  Homer, for instance, gets 
% to speak before Bart's class a hero.

Krabapple:	Children, today's local hero is Homer Simpson.  
		[class cheers] Mr. Simpson bowled a perfect game 
		without the aid of steroids, crack, angel dust, or 
		the other narcotics that are synonymous with pro 
		bowling.
Homer:		Thank you, Bart's teacher.  [she takes her seat] You 
		know, kids, my teacher said I'd never amount to 
		anything -- and until last week, they were dead 
		right.  But now, I've achieved perfection.  [goes to 
		write "PERFECTION" on the blackboard, but gets 
		stymied at "PER".  He gives up and puts down the 
		chalk]  Any questions?  [calls on Milhouse] Yes, 
		Bart's weird friend.
Milhouse:	Will you be my Dad?
Homer:		[chuckles] You've got a father.  He's just a dud.  
		Next question.  [calls on Terri] Yes, the girl Bart 
		has a crush on.
Bart:		Ohhh.
Terri:		Do you think I could grow up to be a doctor?
Homer:		Hey, this was supposed to be about me.  Now any 
		other questions?  [begins calling on other children] 
		Pumpkin Face?  Headgear?  Chicken pox?  Smelly?  
		Lazy eye?  [calls on Bart] Spiky head?  Okay, class

% First, Homer tries to connect with his boy, but Bart has already 
% learned to find father figures where he can:  Construction workers, 
% the internet, even Nelson.  Trying his luck with Lisa, Homer asks if 
% he can help her with her homework.  When he hears the assignment -- 
% find three words where "y" is the vowel -- he quietly backs out of 
% the room.
%
% Finally, Homer realizes he can lavish attention on Maggie, "the 
% forgotten Simpson."  This may not be such a good deal for Maggie.  
% When Homer tries baby-talking to her, he appears, from her 
% viewpoint, to be grossly distorted and scary.  (Not to mention the 
% fact that he woke her up from her nap.)  She tries to get away, but 
% the door is closed.
%
% Next, Homer perches Maggie on the couch.  He's dressed to resemble

% to his waist.

Hi, Maggie!  I'm Homey-Womey, the Teletubby -- and I'm all man, in 
case you heard otherwise.  Let's see what's on tummy-vision!  [turns

% -- and then nothing, because Maggie doesn't come back down.  
% Instead, she's caught the laundry line, and travels hand-over-hand 
% in a bid to get away from Homer.  She gives up when Homer reels her 
% back in.

% other addition -- waves that can wash a man out to sea.  Suddenly, 
% Homer is caught in a riptide.  (Hmmm, make that *two* additions.)
%
% Swimming against the current is useless, so Homer tries sinking to 
% the bottom.  This way, he can run to shore.  Unfortunately, his 
% ability to hold his breath isn't quite up to the task.  He rises to 
% the surface and tells Maggie to call Aquaman for help.  Then, he 
% slips beneath the waves again.
%
% Maggie takes the plunge to save her Dad from Davy Jones' locker.  
% She swims to the spot where she last saw Homer, and pulls him back 
% to the surface.  As Homer thanks her, he sinks again.  Maggie rolls 
% her eyes and re-rescues him.  "Oh, you do love me," says Homer.

% Back on shore, Dr. Hibbert gives Homer a quick check-up.

		do seem to have swallowed a number of shark eggs.
Homer:		Actually, that was before I went in the ocean.
Hibbert:	Well, I don't want to pry into your personal life --
Homer:		Then don't.
Marge:		Doctor, how could a little baby save a full-grown 
		man from drowning?
Hibbert:	Ho, ho, it's quite simple.  When a parent's life is 
		in danger, a child can summon super-human strength.
Homer:		And all I care about is that my little girl loves 
		me.  And we're going to spend a lot more time 
		together from now on.
