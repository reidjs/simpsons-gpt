-- From Romeo to Homer, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

% hair out of her tall bouffant, producing a hole.  While Milhouse plays
% cowboys and Indians with Bart, a tumbleweed of Marge's hair blows by.

% back behind herself, landing on Jasper's head.  Jasper knocks it off
% and it hits Mrs. Glick, who is in the seat in front of Marge.  Glick
% and Jasper begin knocking it back and forth as Marge looks distressly
% annoyed.

% Somewhat later, Homer, once again, speaks seductively to his wife, who
% is wearing a scarf around her towering hairdo.

-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

% Marge takes it off, and Homer screams at what he sees: holes

   Lisa: [line two] Me, too.

Hibbert: I think the problem may be stress.
-- Well, duh, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

% Marge arrives back at home, where everybody is loafing around the

% makes so many sacrifices for them, they should make one for her.

 Lisa: I'll stop buying Malibu Stacey clothing.
 Bart: And I'll take up smoking and give that up.
Homer: Good for you, son.  Giving up smoking is one of the hardest

 Lisa: But he didn't do anything!
Homer: Didn't he, Lisa?  Didn't he?
