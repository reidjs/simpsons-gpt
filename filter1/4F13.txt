% Marge and Homer are interested.

Marge:    Ooh, that sounds fabulous, Homer.  Stores throw the best

Homer:    You like parties, huh?  Well, I just remembered they're
          having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend.
Marge:    You didn't remember that.  You just saw it on TV.
Homer:    The important thing is I didn't imagine it.

% Janey's in Lisa's room with Lisa reading "The Baby Sitter Twins"

Janey:    I can't get enough of "The Baby Sitter Twins."  They arrested
          the counterfeiters, rescued the President, _and_ made _four_
          dollars.
Lisa:     I love everything about the world of babysitting.  The

Janey:    And full refrigerator privileges!
Lisa:     That's a trust, Janey.  A sacred trust.

Lovejoy:  Friday, you will have the chance to [waving hands] _party
          down_ in the church basement to the Jesus rock stylings of
          Testaments. That's on Friday, 6 p.m. sharp.
Bart:     [scoffs] All the best bands are affiliated with Satan.
-- Just ask Amy Grant, "My Sister, My Sitter"

% The second announcement is for Lisa's affordable and reliable
% babysitting service, the cost of which is discounted by a dollar for
% anyone who can name the topic of the day's sermon.  No one can answer.
% The mystery topic: love.
%
% Lisa waits by the phone, disappointed that no one's called.  Marge
% explains that parents may want someone older to be prepared for
% anything that could happen, then Lisa sticks up for her advanced
% maturity.

But I'm _very_ mature for my age.  People often mistake me for nine!
-- Lisa, "My Sister, My Sitter"

% At the door is Ned, in need of a babysitter because he has to rescue
% Maude and her mother from Tyre and Sidon ("the Twin Cities of the Holy
% Land"), where they are being held prisoner.  Homer tries to come up
% with an excuse to keep from watching Rod and Todd, but finds himself

% job.  Ned is hesitant, explaining what a handful his kids can be.

Todd's been pinching everyone lately.

% Ned asks Homer's permission, and despite Lisa being there, expressing

% slams the door in Ned's face.
%
% Lisa gets the job.  At the Flanderses, Lisa plays a religious board
% game with Rod and Todd.

Lisa:     Where are the dice?
Todd:     Daddy says dice are wicked.
 Rod:     We just move one space at a time.  It's less fun that way.

% Lisa picks up the board game box cover and out flies a moth, scaring
% Rod and Todd.  Lisa tries to calm them by telling them moths are no
% more harmful than a ladybug, frightening them more.

They're gonna get eaten alive in Middle School.
-- Lisa comments on Rod and Todd's panic over a moth, "My Sister, My

% It's bedtime, and Rod and Todd are in prayer.  Rod thanks God for
% sending Lisa to protect them from the moth.  Todd prays for a bedtime
% story -- about robots -- named Rod and Todd.  Lisa is there listening,
% and gives Rod his wish.

Lisa:     [tucking in Rod] Once there was a robot named Todd.
Todd:     Did he have a brother?
Lisa:     Yes, he had a brother named Rod, who was two space years
          older than him.
Todd:     [frightened, pulling up his blanket] I don't like this story!

%
% At night, Bart finds Lisa getting dropped off home and paid by Dr.
% Hibbert for babysitting.  Dr. Hibbert admires Lisa's competence, then
% suffers from the incompetence of Volvo mechanics.
%
% Bart sees Lisa counting her babysitting gains.

Bart:     You made all that money for sitting around and watching TV
          and eating food??
Lisa:     There's a lot more to it than that, Bart.  I don't just
          babysit.  I sell peace of mind for a dollar an hour.  Two
          dollars after nine o'clock.
-- Lisa Simpson, humanitarian and businesswoman, "My Sister, My Sitter"

% With that kind of money, Bart would be gone, he says.

You could be Abe Lincoln's father's boss!
-- Bart compliments Homer on his classy attire, "My Sister, My Sitter"

% Homer hopes no one notices the pie stain he left on his suit.  Bart

% be babysitting instead, playing up Lisa's reputation of reliability.

Take it like a man, boy, and do everything your sister says.
-- Homer, "My Sister, My Sitter"

% Bart is quite vocal on the issue, saying it's an injustice for him to
% be babysat by someone 2 years and 38 days younger than him.  Marge and

          fair and fun.
Bart:     You're dead.
Lisa:     You should wash up for dinner.  To make it fun, you can use

Bart:     You are so dead.
-- Breaking the ice, "My Sister, My Sitter"

% Homer drives the car down the waterfront at the South Street
% Squidport grand opening, saying, "I love these pedestrian malls.
% There's practically no traffic."  Everyone tries to get out of the way
% of the car, in a funk over Homer's driving through.  Marge thinks they

% ("Stop, you idiots!")  Homer parks the car in the middle an emblem

% Meanwhile at home, Bart starts making things difficult for his

Lisa:     Uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have.
Bart:     I didn't say I was gonna eat them.  I just want to look at

% Bart asks for dessert, and while fetching for it, Lisa chides Bart.

Lisa:     Bart, if you don't want to have a babysitter, maybe you

Bart:     Oh, I'm a baby, huh?  Well then I'll act like a baby. [takes
          a huge bite of his chocolate ice cream] [it spills onto his

Bart:     Relax, I'll give her some ice cream. [feeds all his ice cream

Homer:    You've never been?
Marge:    I'm so honored that Springfield has been chosen to host to

Bart:     [on the phone in the TV room] That's right.  I want the
          twenty five foot Italian party sub.  And don't skimp on the
          vinegar. [hangs up]  It's time Lisa learned what babysitting

%
% Lisa finds Bart on the couch, and orders him to bed.  Making himself

%
% The doorbell rings.  Krusty barges in, shouting, "Hey hey!  Are you
% ready to get rowdy!?"  Lisa says, "Excuse me?"  Apparently, Bart hired

% till he gets paid.  He asks for $500 just for saying "Hey hey!"
%
% Emergency men show up asking for the person who called for an

% Next visit is by an official, who got a report that Lisa saw a UFO.
% Lisa angrily yells, "I didn't see any UFO!"  "That's right, Miss.  You

% A chauffeur arrives.

 Man:     I'm here to pick up the Ambassador from Ghana.
Lisa:     Well he's not here!  Nobody's here!  And none of you should

 Man:     Why would the Ambassador do such a thing?

% sees Bart is unconscious on his floor.
%
% Lisa can't get 911 assistance because "she" has already called before
