% The Simpsons enjoy a trip to the campgrounds.  It is beautiful
% weather for an outing -- the sky is blue, the leaves are green, and
% the windshield is white and brown with the remains of unfortunate
% mosquitoes.  A park ranger flags them down.

Folks, you're going to want to turn around.  The bugs are firmly in 
charge.
-- Park ranger, "Bart to the Future"

% Homer grudgingly turns around the car.  A swarm of bugs engulfs the
% rangers hand and, when it disperses, the ranger's class ring is
% missing.  After he complains, the swarm returns to deposit the ring

% Bart spots an Indian gaming casino, and Homer quickly pulls into its
% parking lot.  Marge doesn't think this little detour is a good idea.

Homer:	Let's go, Marge.  Come on, come on, come on!
Marge:	Homer, you know I have a gambling problem.
Homer:	Well, what better place to celebrate your recovery than 
amidst the frenzied excitement of the casino floor.
Marge:	Hrrmph.
-- "Bart to the Future"

% Homer and Bart run off to join the casino floor's frenzied
% excitement.  A bouncer stops Bart at the door.

Bouncer:	No minors.
Bart:		Yeah, but I really want --
Homer:		Sorry, son.  Although they seem strange to us, we must 
		respect the ways of the Indian.
-- "Bart to the Future"

% Ever respectful, Homer walks into the main greeting hall, repeating
% "Hi-how-are-you" in the rhythm of a stereotypical war chant.
%
% Meanwhile, Bart is as determined as ever to get into the casino. 
% Looking around, he notices Arthur Crandall talking to one of the
% casino's security people at the back door.  Crandall, unseen since
% "The Gabbo Show" folded, has fallen on hard times.  He tries to
% negotiate a free night's stay from the casino, but is forced to
% settle for a free trip to the pasta bar.  Bart sneaks onto
% Crandall's truck and climbs into Gabbo's carrying case.  Other than
% the fact the case now weighs much more, Crandall notices nothing
% amiss as he takes the it backstage.
%
% Onstage, Crandall opens the case before his audience.  To everyone's
% surprise -- especially Crandall's -- Bart hops out of the case. 
% Casino security men quickly capture him and take him to the
% manager's office.

Manager:	[on phone] Your linen service has broken many 
		promises to us.  Laundry bill soar like eagle.  
		[hangs up] Jerk.
		[walks over to Bart] So, you like to sneak into 
		casinos?
Bart:		I wasn't going to gamble.  I just wanted a Bloody 
		Mary.
Manager:	Listen to me.  Unless you change your deceitful 
		ways.  I foresee a life bitterness and failure for 
		you, Bart Simpson.
Bart:		How'd you know my name?
Manager:	[holds up a legal document] Your father just took 
		out a second mortgage downstairs.  You're listed as 
		collateral.
Bart:		Oh.  I thought that maybe you were some kind of 
		Indian mystic who could tell the future?
Manager:	Who says I'm not?
-- Insert "Twilight Zone" theme here, "Bart to the Future"

% A fire flares up from a hearth in the office's center, startling
% Bart.

Manager:	If you want to see the future, throw a treasured 
		personal item onto the fire.
		[Bart tosses a small object, which explodes with a 
		bang]
		Not a firecracker!
Bart:		Hey, I bought it from a guy on your reservation.
Manager:	That's Crazy Talk.
Bart:		No, it's true.
Manager:	No, I know, that's my brother, Crazy Talk.  We're 
		all a little worried about him.
-- Even Dances with Sock Puppets is concerned, "Bart to the Future"

% The manager invites Bart to look deep into the flames, to see what 
% lies in store thirty years from now.  Bart, and the audience, sees a
% vision of the boy as he will be in 2030.  Future-Bart's hair has
% grown a bit scraggly, and he has tied some of it into a pony tail. 
% A Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and sandals complete the "dressed down"
% look.  He has inherited his father's physique, pot belly and all,
% something that was no doubt aided by many cans of Future Duff.  He
% takes a sip from one such can, and burps loudly.
%
% Bart picks up a guitar and begins to tune it.

Bart:	[strumming the guitar] Check, check.  Hello, Capital City.  
	[one of the strings breaks] Way to make a guitar, Sears.
Ralph:	[walks in, dripping wet and without clothes] Hey, Bart, 
	any clean towels?
Bart:	Nah.  Use this.  [tosses Ralph a newspaper]
Ralph:	I'm sick of having to dry myself with a newspaper.  You 
	could at least do some laundry.  I pay the rent.  [ties 
	the paper around his waist, like a towel]
Bart:	Dude, you know I'm good for it.  I'll have plenty of money 
	when my lawsuit pays off.
Ralph:	You mean the spider bite at Disneyland?
Bart:	Or the incident with the over-salted fries.
-- "Bart to the Future"

% There's a knock at the door -- it's a Holo-gram for Bart, from
% Nelson.  He grants Bart's band permission to play at his club,
% albeit for a salary of popcorn shrimp.  He signs off with the

%
% Bart's band has a gig, but his amp's in hock.  He figures he can
% borrow some money from his folks, so it's time for a trip to
% Springfield, via non-hover-bus.
%
% Back at Bart's boyhood home, Homer and Marge try Virtual Fudge, but
% find it lacking in comparison to Cyber-Fudge.  Bart and Ralph
% arrive.

Bart:	Yo, it's me!
Homer:	[takes the Virtual Fudge wire out of his mouth, which 
	shocks him] Oh, what a bleak and horrible future we live 
	in!
Bart:	Don't you mean, "present?"
Homer:	Right, right, present.  Anyway, can I get you some Soylent 
Green.  [holds up a box of it]
Ralph:	Isn't that made of people?
Homer:	Uh, oh, here we go ...
Bart:	Hey, Dad, my band finally got a break.  I just need a

Homer:	Oh, I'm tired of giving you money.  Why can't you be more 
	like Lisa?
Bart:	I am so sick of hearing about Lisa.  Just because she's

Marge:	She's President of the United States!
Bart:	President-*elect*.
-- Oh, is that all?  "Bart to the Future"

% Bart says that he, too, could be President if he wasn't so "real." 
% That doesn't impress Homer enough to pry any cash from him, so he

Bart:	What happened to you, man?  You used to be cool.
Homer:	I'm still cool!
Bart:	Nah, you've changed, man.
Homer:	Well, I do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see

	[Ned answers the door.  He's wearing dark glasses and 
	carrying a cane]
Ned:	Jesus?  Is that you?
Ralph:	Mr. Flanders, you're blinded-ded!
Ned:	Oh, yeah.  I never should have had that trendy laser

% Bart and Ralph get to play their gig at Nelson's Crab Shack, but it
% doesn't well.  Jimmy Buffet charges royalties, so Bart plays one of

% "Margaritaville."  Only a grid of lasers keeps the boys from being
% pelted with beer bottles, and even that is starting to buckle from

-- President Lisa Simpson, "Bart to the Future"

% After a final question from Helen Thomas ("Wasn't I wearing a

Lisa:		As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch 
		from President Trump.  How bad is it Secretary Van 
		Houten?
Milhouse:	[shows to a chart] We're broke.
Lisa:		The country is broke?  How can that be?
Milhouse:	Well, remember when the last administration decided 
		to invest in our nation's children?  Big mistake.
Aide:		The balanced breakfast program just created a 
		generation of ultra-strong super-criminals.
Milhouse:	And midnight basketball taught them to function 
		without sleep.
Lisa:		What about my pledge to build the world's largest 
		bookmobile?  Isn't there any money left for that?
Aide:		No, and we've borrowed from every country in the 
		world.
		[without warning, Bart bursts into the room]
Bart:		Hey, Lisa, call off your -- [two Secret Service 
		agents jump him] Ow!  Watch the ponytail.
Lisa:		Let him up, please.  [the agents do so]
		What are you doing here?
Bart:		I knew you'd need some help keeping it real, so I 
		figured I could be, like, your co-President.

Bart:		Mom!  Lisa won't share!
Marge:		Be nice to your brother, Lisa.

% That night, the family sits down to dinner.  Or at least Homer,

Lisa:	Appointed a Supreme Court justice.
Marge:	Oh.
Bart:	"Bewitched" marathon.
Marge:	Hmm.
Homer:	Searched for Lincoln's gold.
Lisa:	Dad, that's just a myth.  Lincoln didn't hide any gold in

-- The dignity of the office?  "Bart to the Future"

% Just then, the presidential helicopter touches down on the lawn.

% Lisa rolls her eyes in exasperation.
%
% Undaunted by Lisa's skepticism at dinnertime, Homer starts his

% him.

Homer:	... fourscore four, fourscore five, fourscore six, 
	fourscore and seven paces.  [swings the pickaxe into the 
	floor]
Marge:	Wait!  How do you know this is where Lincoln buried the 
	gold.  You just started counting from an arbitrary place.
Homer:	I just started what from a what?
Marge:	Your plan makes no sense.
Homer:	Gold bars discovered by Marge, zero.  Gold bars discovered 
	by Homer, well, let's just see.  [swings axe again, and
