% The show opens with a commercial for Blockoland, the park where

Homer:	Kids, how would you like to go to ... Blockoland!
Bart +

Homer:	But the TV gave me the impression that --
Bart:	We said, "Meh!"

% Marge is more willing to go.  So is Maggie, who is so enthusiastic
% that she straps herself into her car seat and "hops" it out the
% front door.  The family thinks this is cute -- until they hear the
% car's motor start.
%
% The tram at Blockoland bumpily rolls along on its square wheels.  It
% drops off the Simpsons and some other people at the park entrance,
% and then continues on its way.  At the front gate, a man dressed as
% a block with a cowboy hat greets guests with a friendly, "Howdy,
% partner!"  Another block, dressed as Lincoln gets too close and
% bumps into the cowboy.  The two stick together and need to be pried
% apart by park attendants.  Elsewhere, a little girl bounces down a
% blocky slide.

% The family stops at a map showing the lay of the land.

Lisa:	Okay, we have our choice of Rectangle Land, Cube Country, 
	or Squaresville.
Marge:	Squaresville sounds pretty cool.

% Homer amuses himself with funhouse mirrors.  The first one makes him
% look as if he's constructed of Fun Assembly Blocks.

Homer:	[robotically] I am a robot.  Do what I say.  [laughs]

% The family eats at the "Build Your Own Meal" restaurant.

Homer:	[holds up a blocky-looking apple] Check it out -- I built

-- Keeps the doctor away, "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% Homer has an epiphany while riding in a Blocko-boat with Lisa.  "I
% get it," he says, "Everything's made of blocks!"  Even the "water"
% surrounding the boat is just loose blue Assembly Fun Blocks.  He
% playfully splashes a few in Lisa's face, and a safety attendant
% reprimands him.  When Homer defies his order, the attendant gets
% down from his chair, and walks across the "water" towards Homer's
% boat.  Homer leaps overboard, and immediately sinks.  After some
% flailing around he manages to climb back into the boat.  Lifting his
% shirt, he discovers that the Blocko water has Blocko leeches, and
% hurriedly plucks them off his chest.
%
% Aside from that incident, it was a pretty fun day for the Simpson
% family.  They drive home from the park with their souvenirs.  Bart
% is having second thoughts about his uncomfortable shirt made of
% Assembly Fun Blocks.

Bart:	Ow!  Why did I get this Lego(tm) shirt?
Marge:	Don't you mean Blocko shirt?
Bart:	Right, right.  *Blocko* shirt.
Marge:	Lisa, how's your Eiffel Tower kit?
Lisa:	It's okay, but it's missing a piece.  [points to missing 
	block at the tower leg]
Homer:	Welcome to real life, Lisa.  You can't fight City Hall, 
	a.k.a. Blockoland, so don't even try?
Marge:	What kind of thing is that to tell your children.
Homer:	It's what I always tell them.  I told them that twice 
	yesterday, and then again as they were going to sleep.
Marge:	I'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
Homer:	You're right, honey.  Hear that, kids?  [with gusto] The 
	Simpsons are going to Blockoland!
All:	Yay!  [well, all except Maggie]
-- "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% Homer U-turns the car, surprising the other drivers on the highway. 
% The family arrives as workers disassemble Blockoland for overnight
% storage.  Fortunately, the souvenir man is still at his stand.

Homer:		You sold my little girl a shoddy Eiffel Tower.
Salesman:	Hey, tough luck, pal.  You can't fight the souvenir 
		industry, we're too powerful.
-- "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% Homer agrees, and walks off.  When he sees how disappointed Lisa is,
% he works up the courage for a second try.  He vows to give the man
% "a little souvenir of my own," which turns out to be a snow globe
% with a little bust of Homer inside.  The souvenir guy is so touched,

Homer:	Come on, why won't you go out with Bart?
Sherri:	He's a smelly, ugly dork.
Homer:	Please, "ugly" is such a smelly word.  Who would you 
	rather go out with?
Sherri:	Tommy.  [indicates a handsome boy bathed in an angelic

Homer:	Well, duh!  He's breathtaking.  But Bart has inner beauty, 
	like you'd find in a rodent.  [cut to Bart, gnawing rat-

		[unscrews a jar lid, and drops it on the counter] 
		Oops.
Hairdresser:	Why are you doing these things?
Homer:		Either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more 
		lids will be unscrewed.
Hairdresser:	I cannot streak that much hair.  Think of the costs 
		-- I'd be ruined.
Homer:		Oh, really?
		[cut to the back room.  Homer has his reading

		Boy, you weren't kidding.  Your profit margins are

Hairdresser: 	You see?  This is what I'm --

		lightener?
Hairdresser:	But we must have it -- it is the lifeblood of the

		It's the Springfield [realizes] Oh.
Duff:		No, no.  There's no "oh."
Homer:		You're moving the team to Albuquerque, aren't you?
Duff:		No, no, we would never abandon our loyal Springfield

Homer:		Well, okay, but you can't silence Homer Simpson.  
		I'm a friend of the downtrodden.  And I'm not going
