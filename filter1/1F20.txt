   Moe: All right, I raise a quarter.

 Lenny: I'm out.
Barney: I'm out.  Whoa -- [passes out; chair tips over]
   Moe: Homer, you want any cards?  [Homer gags] Homer!

 Homer: Whoo!  Don't try to eat these so-called "chips".

Lenny: You want another card or not?
Homer: Huh?  Oh, OK.  I'll take three.  [Moe deals them] D'oh!  D'oh!
       D'oh!  I mean...woo hoo.
  Moe: I'm in.  [tosses a chip into the pot] Let's see your cards.
Homer: Oh, I was bluffing.  [shows them]
  Moe: Ha ha.  Come to papa -- wait a minute!  You have a straight
       flush, Homer!  You do this every time, you -- oh, you -- oh!
       Gah!  I'm choking on my own rage here.
 Carl: Hey, don't yell at Homer.  Just 'cause he's a little slow...
Homer: [gasps] [thinks] Something was said...not good.  What was it?
       "Don't yell at Homer!"  No, that's OK.  What was it?  ...Slow!
       They called you slow!

% Homer tells the family about it at a meal the next day.

       slow?
 Bart: Buh.  [looks away]
 Lisa: Sla.  [looks away]
        [Maggie sucks her pacifier]
Marge: {Uh, we don't think you're slow.  On the other hand, it's not
       like you go to museums or read books or anything.}
Homer: {You think I don't want to?  It's those TV networks, Marge: they
       won't let me.  One quality show after another, each one fresher
       and more brilliant than the last.  If they only stumbled once,

Marge: Oh, Homey, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always
       things you can do to feel better.
Homer: Take another bath in malt liquor?
Marge: There's that...or you could take an adult education course.
Homer: Oh, and how is "education" supposed to make me feel smarter?
       Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old
       stuff out of my brain.  Remember when I took that home wine-
       making course and I forgot how to drive?
Marge: That's because you were drunk!
Homer: And how.
-- Something to be really proud of, "Secrets of a Successful Marriage"

% So Homer decides to head down to the adult education center.  He walks
% down the hall past the classrooms.  The first one features Patty and
% Selma teaching how to melt their men.  "One way to drive your man wild
% is to wear tight, revealing clothes," explains Patty.  Selma walks out
% in red lingerie -- at which the women in the class gasp in horror.

       Oh, my tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
Marge: Oh, here, let me help you.
        [unhooks it; she and Homer look at each others]
Homer: Wait a minute...wait, that's it!  I know now what I can offer you
       that no one else can: complete and utter dependence!
Marge: Homer, that's not a good thing.
Homer: Are you kidding?  It's a wondrous, marvelous thing!  Marge, I
       need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could
       possibly ever need you!  I need you to take care of me, to put up
       with me, and most of all I need you to love me, 'cause I love
       you.
Marge: But how do I know I can trust you?
Homer: Marge, look at me: we've been separated for a day, and I'm as
       dirty as a Frenchman.  In another few hours I'll be dead!  I
       can't afford to lose your trust again.

 Bart: Look, Dad: I missed you so much that I couldn't concentrate in
       school and I got an F.
Homer: Hey, this is dated two weeks ago.
 Bart: Oh, sorry.  Here's a fresh one.
Marge: And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you
       later tonight.
Homer: Special present?  I don't want to wait!  I want it now.  I want
       the children to see.  Ooh -- oh, right.  Later.  Heh heh heh --
