Homer:	Your honor, if may sing a little bit of, "Don't Fear the

% At school, Homer proves to be an even bigger disruption than Bart.

Edna:	Today, we're going to talk about predicates and predicate

Edna:	Mr. Simpson, I'm trying to teach.
Homer:	Come on, these kids are never going to use that stuff.
Edna:	Mr. Simpson, will you please go back to sleep.
Homer:	Fine.  [curls up on the floor, and starts snoring.  Bart

% A baseball game at school goes a little better.  Homer encourages 
% Bart to "Shut out everything but the sound of my criticism."  It 
% must have worked, because Bart connects with the ball.  He and Homer 
% run around the bases.  Soon, Homer runs out of steam, and collapses.  
% Bart's able to drag Homer along to home plate for his first home 
% run.  Homer tries to hug his son, but Bart's father looks a lot

Marge:	Well, you can tell she's never had kids.  Look how high 
	and firm her breasts are.
Lisa:	Granted, but you gotta admit constant supervision has been 
	good for Bart.  He might even make the honor roll, if Dad 
	can control his night terrors.
Homer:	Well, that's a pretty big "if," honey.
Bart:	[gets up] Come on, Dad, I gotta go to the bathroom.
Homer:	Oh, I just got comfortable.  Use the bottle.  [hands Bart

Bart:	I'm a latchkey kid.
Lisa:	You are not!
Harm:	[bangs gavel] Quiet, little girl.  [to Homer and Marge]

Homer:	I admit it.
Marge:	Homer, no, we're not bad parents.
Harm:	Yes, you are.  Just say it!
Marge:	No, I won't.  And frankly, Judge, I think you're a bully.
