% Luckily, there's a commercial break.

Jack:		Ey, remember the Fifties?  Remember 
		television, Coca-Cola, and Dick Clark?
Homer:		[gasps] I remember television!
Jack:		Come join me, Wolfguy Jack, at Greaser's Café, 
		where it's 1955 every day of the year, baby.
Disclaimer Man:	Actual year may vary.  Consult calendar for 
		current year.
Marge:		A fifties-style restaurant.
Lisa:		What a neat idea.
Bart:		Why don't we eat there tonight?
Homer:		Ah, we'll go next month.
-- No time like the future for the past, "Take My Wife, Sleaze"

% True to Homer's word, the family goes to Greaser's one month later.  
% It is indeed a cornucopia of Fifties kitsch.  In addition to the
% standard chrome fixtures, pastel colors, and bouncy upbeat music on
% the jukebox, the booths are made out of period cars.  Waitresses
% roller-skate from one customer to another, just like they didn't way
% back when.  Newspaper headlines of the era, like "Beatles Unite!"
% decorate the walls.
%
% The restrooms carry the theme by being labeled "Cool Cats" and
% "Squares."  Lenny tries the first one, but to everyone's surprise,
% it's the ladies room.  Embarrassed, he slinks to the "Squares" room. 
% No dice -- that one's for the ladies, too.
%
% Jay North, who played "Dennis the Menace" on TV, sits in a booth to
% greet his fans.

Bart:	Dennis the Menace?
North:	Yes, I was America's bad boy.  I once hid my dad's hat.  
	[laughs]
Bart:	Uh-huh.
North:	And another time, I accidentally stepped in Mr. Wilson's 
	flower bed.  That was a two-part episode.  [laughs]
Bart:	I have to go.

% The family settles into their booth.  As Abe tries to drive to

% fascinated by the old-timey napkin dispenser, even though Lisa
% points out it's exactly the same thing as a modern napkin dispenser.
%
% Homer's fascination with the dispenser is interrupted by Wolfguy
% Jack's trademark howl.

Jack:	[howls, then coughs] Aw, man, oh, my throat doctor says 
	I'm not supposed to do that anymore.  Okay, is everybody 
	ready for our nightly dance contest?
Marge:	Dancing!
Homer:	Oh, no, you're not getting me on that dance floor.  Don't 
	try and make me.  [shakes his fist] If I have to get a 
	divorce, I will.
Jack:	Our grand prize tonight is a vintage 1955 Harley-Davidson 
	motorcycle.  [a turntable spins around to reveal a model 
	Fifties garb and a gleaming red motorcycle]
Homer:	Oh!  Oh!  I need a dance partner!  [points at Marge] What 
	about you?
Marge:	Okay, Daddio.
-- He just needed the right incentive, "Take My Wife, Sleaze"

% Wolfguy Jack cues up Johnny Bobby's "Mental House Rock," and the
% dance contestants prepare to twist the night away.  Homer and Marge
% can really cut a rug.  He spins Marge around the dance floor.  Then
% Marge manages to spin Homer in the same way.  Homer again spins
% Marge, this time by the hair.  (Ouch!)  The couple does a running
% backflip off a wall.  Then, Homer tosses Marge so far in the air,
% she flies out the roof, and has to re-enter by the front door.  For
% a finale, Homer spins Marge in place, mussing her hair (and probably
% polishing the floor a little, too).
%
% Wolfguy is mighty impressed.  "I've never seen such reckless
% disregard for a wife's well-being in my life," he says, as if this
% were a good thing.  Homer and Marge are duly awarded the motorcycle. 
% It doesn't take long for Homer to get possessive about his new toy. 
% As the crowd presses closer to look at it, Homer barks at them to
% back off.

Jack:	Okay, hep cats, let's twirl some more platters at 
	Greaser's Café, where the Fifties are never going away.
	[three days later, he boards up the restaurant]
	Well, that dream is over.  Least we still have each other, 
	right honey?  Honey?
	[the camera pulls back to reveal Jack standing alone, on a 
	dark rainy day.  He howls, but it dissolves into another 
	coughing fit]

%
% Homer takes his prize home, where he sits in the front yard, making

	Like Mayonnaise and Marmalade
	And other spreadable things
	[Homer revs the motorcycle engine.  Both his pants and his 
	shirt get caught in the chain an chewed up, leaving Homer 
	in his undies]
	So I guess you are my hero
	And there's something you should know
	I want to make it clear,
	So I'm going to sing it slow
	[Bart on his bike, and Homer on the motorcycle, ride side

	under him, flies through the air, and crashes through the 
	roof of a house.  The two share a laugh]
	If you weren't a man,
	And my father, too,
	I'd buy you a diamond ring,
	And then I'd marry you.

Father:		He's a rebel, I tell you, a rebel without a cause -- 
		just like that boy in that popular movie we saw.
		[Jimmy and his gang ride through a store, raising
