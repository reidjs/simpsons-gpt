% Scene:  Exterior of the Simpsons house.  Snow is falling.

B: [VO] 'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the home,

% Fade to inside.  Aside from the window in the center of the screen,
% the picture is black.  A pair of eyes enters from stage right.  As
% it passes in front of the window, we see that it is Bart.

B: Not a creature was stirring,

% Bart continues moving, his eyes exiting stage left.

B:                              'cept for me and this poem.

% Bart opens the door to Lisa and Maggie's room.  Lisa is asleep with
% a smile on her face.  Maggie, in a small bed (not crib) next to Lisa's,
% is also asleep, though she sucks furiously on her pacifier.

B: My sisters were nestled all snug in their beds,
   While visions of candy bars danced in their heads.

% With a twinkle, a thought balloon appears above the girls, depicting
% two candy bars and a Rollo with arms and legs, dancing to funky music.

B: Then I sprang like a spring,

% Bart hops out the doorway.  The girls each open one eye and watch him go.

B:                              and snuck like a sneak,

% Bart quietly hops down the hallway.

B: Down the stairs to the gifts,

% Bart slides down the banister.

B:                               for just a quick peek.

% Bart slides downward out of frame, and lands with a thud.
% Bart picks himself up and looks off camera with a troubled expression.

B: When, lo and behold, what did I see?

% Cut to Bart's viewpoint.  Lisa (wearing a blue nightgown) and Maggie
% (in a white baggie) standing by the tree.

B: Lisa and Maggie had just beaten me!

% Lisa is admiring a small present.  Maggie shakes a small wrapped box.
% (Whap whap whap.)  Bart crawls to a rather large red box, which he
% pokes at with his left index finger.  (Thump thump.)

B: I poked at my package, and said, [aloud] This is rad, man!

% On the couch and wall behind Bart grows a menacing shadow,
% with hunched shoulders, and fingers curled.

B: [VO] Then noticed Dad's shadow.  He looked like a madman!

% The shadow reaches to the side and turns on the light.  Cut to Homer,
% in his blue nightgown, blue stocking cap, and blue socks.

H: Oh Maggie, oh Lisa, oh little Bartholomew!

% Homer points to each child as he says the name.

H: Go upstairs, go right now, before I kill all of you!

% Homer punctuates his brief speech with strangling gestures.
%
% The kids scurry off.

B: And so into bed we fled in a flash,

% Trailing a cloud of dust, Bart hops into bed.  The lights are put out
% (presumably by Homer, off-screen), and the screen goes black, save for
% Bart's eyes.

B: Awaiting 'til morning to open our stash.

% Bart blinks twice before going to sleep.
%
% Through the window, the sun peeks over the horizon.

B: At last daybreak came, and we scampered so cheerily,

% Lisa, Maggie, and Bart rush past the window, arms extended in front
% of them, with expressions of great anticipation.

B: While Mom and Dad yawned, and gazed at us wearily.

% Homer and Marge on the couch.  Homer still in his nightgown, his
% two hairs uncombed.  Marge in a grey nightgown next to him with a
% cup of coffee, her hair still up in rollers.  Both have bags under
% their eyes.  As Homer yawns, we hear the kids tearing into their
% presents, as ribbons, empty boxes, and torn wrapping paper fly past.

B: For Maggie, a pacifier.

% Maggie holds a shiny new pacifier (twinkle!) in her hand.  She removes
% her existing pacifier (pop!) and smiles.  (No teeth.)

B:                          For Lisa, some dolls.

% Lisa, smiling, holds a Binky doll in her right hand, and a Bongo doll
% in her left.  The dolls have no pupils.

B: For me a big burp gun

% Bart smiles broadly as he holds a large green toy gun.

B:                       which shoots ping-pong balls.

% He aims and pulls the barrel repeatedly.  With each pull comes a
% popping sound, and a red ping-pong ball emerges from the barrel of
% the gun, bouncing off Homer's head.  Homer puts his hands in front
% of his face, but that doesn't help.

B: Then on came the TV,

% The family are camped out on the couch, Maggie in Homer's lap.
% Homer hits the remote, and ``Jingle Bells'' meekly plays on the
% TV set as we see Itchy and Scratchy in a snow scene, wearing
% Christmas caps (no scarves) and waving politely at the camera.

B:                       and we started to doze
   Through all the exciting Christmas theme shows.

% Everyone gradually nods off.  First Homer, then Marge, then Lisa,
% then Maggie.  Bart is the only one remaining awake.
%
% Shot from beside the TV.  Bart in the foreground, continuing his
% poem.  The rest of the family asleep on the couch, Lisa curled up at
% one end, her Bongo doll on the floor in front of her.  Maggie is asleep
% in Homer's lap.

B: [aloud] So, to those of you groovin' on my holiday rap,
   Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good nap.

% Bart waves good-bye to all, still holding his toy gun in his right hand.
