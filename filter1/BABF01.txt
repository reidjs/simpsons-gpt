% stage curtains.

Announcer:	Live from fabulous Centauri City, it's "The Simpsons 
		Tenth Halloween Special!"  [curtains part to reveal 
		a pumpkin-shaped spaceship]  Now, please welcome 
		your hosts -- if you haven't been probed by these 
		two, you haven't been probed -- Kang and Kodos!
		[as the audience cheers, the aliens emerge from the 
		spaceship]
Kang:		Thank you, thank you.
Kodos:		Yes, thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to 
		our tenth anniversary show.  Oh, we've got a great 
		g-- [notices Kang lighting an acetylene torch] Kang, 
		what are you doing?
Kang:		You said we were going to warm up the audience.
		[cut to a shot of said audience, which is made up 
		entirely of alien creatures.  We hear laughter, even 
		though the audience members are sitting perfectly 
		still]
Kodos:		[shudders]  Ladies and gentleman, I have to 
		apologize for my partner.  He had to borrow a 
		*human* brain.
		[more laughter]
		[cut to the Simpsons' living room.  They're on the 
		couch, but it's obvious they're not their usual 
		selves.  Homer's a jack-in-the-box, Marge is a 
		witch, Lisa is an ax-attack victim, Bart is a half-
		fly mutant, and Maggie is a half-alien, half-human 
		baby]
Lisa:		What do aliens have to do with Halloween?
Maggie:		Silence!  [produces a ray gun, and disintegrates 
		Lisa]

% [End of intro.  Time:  1:03]
%
% And now that the audience at home is warmed up, let's present our 
% first tale of the supernatural, which is:
%
%		I Know What You Diddily-Iddly-Did
%
% Thick fog shrouds a lonely road through the countryside.  The 
% Simpsons' station wagon is the only car on the road.  Inside the 
% car, Marge is at the wheel.

Lisa:	I still can't believe we escaped from those horrible 
	vampires.
Homer:	But it was worth it to get back our Super Sugar Crisp 
	cereal.  [holds up box]
	[sings to "Sugar Crisp" tune] Can't get enough of that 
	Sugar Crisp ...
Marge:	I'm having a hard time seeing.  Homer, did you remember to 
	put the fog lights in?
Homer:	[still singing] Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in.
Marge:	I'd better pull over and play it safe.  [pulls over, but 
	there's a horrible thump.  She stops the car, opens the 
	door, and discovers that she has run over something]
	[gasps] Please be a dog...
-- Safety first, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% The family runs up to body, and discovers that it's a man.  Homer 
% rolls him over to see that he is none other than Ned Flanders.

Homer:	[pokes him in the eye with a stick] He's dead!  [pokes 
	twice more] He's definitely dead.  [pokes a few more 
	times]
Marge:	Oh, my God!  We killed Ned Flanders.
Bart:	You mean *you* killed Ned Flanders.
Marge:	Oh, it was an accident -- an accident!
Lisa:	We've got to go to the police.
Bart:	They'll never believe a Simpson killed a Flanders by 
	accident.  Even I have my doubts.
Homer:	[holding Ned up] Don't worry, I've got a plan.  Okay, Ned.  
	The first thing we gotta do [begins whispering] is make 
	sure no one knows that you're dead.  If anyone asks, you 
	just say that you're not dead.  [nods Flanders' head up 
	and down]
-- A simple plan, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% The next morning, Homer has taken Ned's body up to the roof of the 
% Simpsons' house.  Next door, Maude tends the Flanders' yard.

Homer:	Hey, Maude!  Look who's helping me clean the chimney!
	[a vulture flies down and begins picking at Ned's arm.  
	Homer shoos it away]
Maude:	Neddy?  Where have you been?
Homer:	[doing bad Ned impersonation, and waving Ned's arm] Hi 
	Maude-diddily.  I've been having fun with my pal Homer.  
	[pause]  Diddily.
Maude:	Oh, I'm so relieved.  Whenever you go on one of your late-
	night fog walks I get so worried.
Homer:	[as Ned] Relax, I'm fine.  But when I do die, I don't want 
	any autopsies.
Maude:	Well, come on down, you goofy roofie.
Homer:	[as Ned] Wow, it sure is slippery up here.
	[goes to toss Ned off the roof]
	[bell dings inside Flanders house]
Maude:	My pies are done.  [goes inside]
	[Flanders lands on the doghouse]
Homer:	Oh, she missed it!
-- It'll be on the next "Faces of Death" video, though, "Treehouse of
   Horror X"

% Take II.  Homer, carrying Ned, kicks open the Flanders' door.

Homer:	[as Ned] Hey Maude, I'm home.  Uh, oh, I think I'm having 
	a heart attack.
	[tosses the body to the floor, closes the door]
Maude:	[screams from inside the house]
Homer:	And that's the end of that chapter.
-- All's well that ends well, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% The whole town, it seems, turns out for the late Ned Flanders' 
% funeral.  Even the Simpsons are there.  Homer counsels everyone not 
% to look too sad, or else they might draw suspicion.  Everyone smiles 
% brightly, and takes their place among the congregation.
%
% Reverend Lovejoy introduces Ned's best friend -- Homer Simpson -- 
% who will say a few words in eulogy.

Homer:	When I think about Ned, I can't help but remember the look 
	on his face when Marge drove over --
Marge:	[sotto voce] Homer, shut up, shut up, shut up!
Homer:	Oh, wait.  What I'd like to say is, we're still looking 
	for the real killers.  Anyway in conclusion, a man cannot 
	be forced to testify against his wife.  [winks 
	conspicuously]
Marge:	[offscreen, sotto voce] Stop winking!
Homer:	We'll miss you, buddy.  [playfully punches Ned's shoulder]
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Relieved that no one suspects they had a hand in Flanders' death, 
% the Simpsons drive home.

Homer:	Hey, we just got away with murder.  And it was so easy!  
	[sees Milhouse crossing the street]  You know, I never 
	liked that little wiener Milhouse.  [steers toward him]
Marge:	[grabs the wheel and steers the car back]
	No more murders!
	[Homer pulls up in his driveway, and the family gets out 
	of the car]
Homer:	But you got to kill --
Marge:	No!
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Perhaps the Simpsons didn't get away with murder, after all.  
% Scrawled on their front door are the ominous words, "I know what you 
% did."  Someone obviously witnessed the accident, but who?  Everyone 
% on Evergreen Terrace that day -- Chief Wiggum, Krusty, Moe, Sherri 
% and Terri -- stares at them accusingly.  Even Homer points a finger 
% at Marge, until she tells him to quit.
%
% Huddled in their darkened living room, the Simpsons are startled by 
% a phone call.

Marge:		Who could be calling at this hour?
Homer:		[nervously answers the phone]  Hello?
Menacing Voice:	[on phone] I know you're alone.
Homer:		Who is this?
Menacing Voice:	Is this Maude Flanders?
Homer:		No, it's Homer
Moe:		Oh, hey Homer, it's Moe.  I must have dialed 
		the wrong number.
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% A flash of lightning (and a 360-degree spin from the camera) reveal 
% that the phrase "I know what you did" has been painted on just about 
% every surface of the living room.  What's worse, a dark figure in 
% rain gear stands in one corner, brandishing a big hook.  The family 
% runs out of the house, and piles into the car, only to see that the 
% car has been decorated with the same phrase.  Homer starts the car 
% and the family flees from the house.
%
% Homer prays for divine intervention.  "Dear God, it's Homer.  If you 
% really love me, you'll save my life now," he says.  The car runs out 
% of gas.
%
% With the mystery man closing in, Homer hatches a desperate plan to 
% save his family.

Homer:		Okay, Marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement 
		park; Lisa, the pet cemetery; Bart, spooky roller 
		disco; And I'll go skinny-dipping in that lake where 
		the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago 
		tonight.
		[turns to Flanders, who is the one wearing the rain 
		gear]
		Now, Flanders, I want you to --
OFF:		[screams]
Marge:		It's impossible.  I killed you.
Flanders:	You can't kill the undead, silly.
Homer:		[pokes Flanders in the eye with a stick]  He's 
		undead, all right.
Bart:		Are you a zombie?
Flanders:	Oh, I wish!  You see, that night, when you hit me 
		with your car ...
		[flashes back to that night.  Flanders walks alone 
		in the fog, along the side of the road]
		I'm making record time on this fog walk.  [a wolf 
		howls in the distance]  Better pick up the pace.
		[a wolf jumps out of the bushes, and shoves Flanders 
		off the road.  There's a struggle, and Flanders 
		emerges as a werewolf]
Homer:		[from a distance, singing] Guess I forgot to put the 
		fog lights in.
		[Flanders prepares to pounce on the unsuspecting 
		vehicle]
Marge:		I'd better pull over and play it safe.
		[runs over Flanders, who transforms back into a man]
		[back to the present]
Lisa:		So you were going to kill us.
Flanders:	[chuckles] Yeah.
		[everyone enjoys a hearty laugh]
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% The clouds part, to reveal the moon.  Flanders immediately 
% transforms into were-Flanders and growls at Homer.  "I want the 
% news, not the weather," Homer says, and turns to Marge to brag about 
% his zing.  She isn't there.  Marge and the kids are running away, 
% several hundred yards down the road.
%
% As the camera focuses on the moon, Flanders attacks Homer.  There's 
% a pause in the carnage.  "Eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, 
% wolfie?"  He speaks too soon, as Flanders resumes eating Homer.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:06]
%
% The night's second tale is entitled:
%
% 			Desperately Xeeking Xena
%
% After making their trick-or-treat rounds, the children of 
% Springfield report to Springfield Elementary School, where the 
% police are X-raying the candy for nasty surprises.
%
% Chief Wiggum is in charge of the portable X-ray machine, which looks 
% like the kind you might find at an airport.  It is set up in the 
% gym.  Ralph is at the head of the line, dressed in police costume 
% and holding a bag of candy.

Wiggum:	Well, well, well.  If it isn't the cutest police officer 
	in Springfield.
Lou:	Hey, you know, we got feelings, too, Chief.
Wiggum:	Just dump your candy on the X-ray belt, Ralphie.  [he does 
	so] There's a good boy.
	[looks at the X-ray monitor as the candy rolls along the 
	belt]
	Safe ... safe ... razor blade ... syringe ... ooh, white 
	chocolate.
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Further back in line, Milhouse shows off his Radioactive Man 
% costume.

Milhouse:	Check it out Lisa, I'm Radioactive Man.
Lisa:		I don't think the real Radioactive Man wears a 
		plastic smock with a picture of himself on it.
Milhouse:	He would on Halloween.
-- Nah, that's more of a Batman thing, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% It's Nelson's turn.  His overstuffed pillowcase jams the machine, 
% just as Chief Wiggum warns.  It rocks back and forth, as if it is 
% about to explode.  Skinner tells everyone to duck and cover.  
% Everyone does, except Bart.  A green beam of radiation shoots out of 
% the machine towards the boy.  Lisa tries to push him out of the way, 
% but the beam catches them both, sending Lisa flying into one of the 
% gym's grandstands.  It topples onto her, leaving only her feet 
% sticking out of the bottom.

Skinner:	She's been crushed!  And so have the hopes of our 
		mathletics team.
Lisa:		[single-handedly lifts the grandstand above her head, and 
		stands up]
		Hold the funeral, poindexter!
Skinner:	[gasps] Poindexter?!
		[Lisa tosses the grandstand through the ceiling]
Bart:		Whoa, Lis, those X-rays must've given you super strength!  
		I wonder if I got any powers.
		[Bart's eyes stretch right out of his head.  He 
		nonchalantly inspects himself from all angles]
		Nope, looks normal.  [retracts his eyes]  Wait a minute 
		... I can stretch!
		[stretches his neck up toward the ceiling]
		Look at me!  [bumps his head into a light fixture, which 
		breaks]
		Ow!  Hot, hot, hot.  [un-stretches his neck]
		I must only use this power to annoy!
-- And thus, a superhero is born, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% As good as his word, Bart stretches his left hand out the gym 
% window.  There's a knock at the gym door, and Skinner answers it.  
% Bart's hand is on the other side.  It gestures side to side, and up 
% and down, then slaps Skinner.

Lisa:	Bart, with these powers, we can become superheroes.
Wiggum:	[being spun by Lisa] Okay, so do it already.
-- Isn't this how the Fantastic Four got started?  "Treehouse of 
   Horror X"

% Bart and Lisa become Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl, respectively.  
% Like all superheroes worth their salt, they have a theme song.  
% [Transcribed here courtesy of Gerry Garrelts.]

Singers:	Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl!
		He's a human rubber band
		And she's the Hulk in pearls!
		[a would be bank-robber is foiled when he runs into 
		Bart, who has stretched himself like a net across 
		the sidewalk.  The robber bounces towards Lisa, who 
		clobbers him]
		He's a limber lad
		She's a powerful lass
		[Bart retrieves Homer's watch from the toilet pipe]
		He'll wring your neck
		And she'll kick your ass!
		[Bart ties up Saddam Hussein.  Lisa kicks his ass]
		They're Stretch Dude
		And Clobber Girl!
		[Lisa uses the Statue of Liberty to poke a hole in 
		an attacking Nazi zeppelin]
		Stretch Dude, Clobber Girl!
		Stretch Dude, Clobber Girl!...
		[Bart and Lisa shake hands with President Clinton.  
		Lisa does this so vigorously that the President is 
		repeatedly slammed into the floor and desk]
Announcer:	Tonight's episode:  Enter the Collector.
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Lucy Lawless, TV's Xena on "Xena:  Warrior Princess" addresses a 
% group of her fans.

Lawless:	... but I'm sure that once girls get to know the 
		real you, you'll get plenty of dates.  Next 
		question.
		[hands go up.  She picks Frink]
Frink:		Yes, over here, n'hey, n'hey.  In episode BF12, you 
		were battling barbarians while riding a winged 
		Appaloosa, yet in the very next scene, my dear, 
		you're clearly atop a winged Arabian.  Please do 
		explain it.
Lawless:	Ah, yeah, well, whenever you notice something like 
		that, a wizard did it.
Frink:		I see, all right, yes, but in episode AG4 --
Lawless:	Wizard.
Frink:		[under breath] Aw, for glaven out loud.
-- And thus, an a.t.s. cliché is born, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Suddenly, the Comic Book Guy crashes through the skylight on the 
% type of electromagnet you might see suspended from a crane.  He is 
% dressed as ... the Collector.

Collector:	Behold, I am the Collector, and I have come to add 
		you to my collection.
		[turns on a magnet, which attracts Lucy's 
		breastplate.  She sails up to the magnet, where she 
		is trapped]
Lawless:	Must ... remove ... my ... breastplate!
		[unties the straps holding it on.  Below, everyone 
		in the audience produces a camera]
		Maybe later.  [reties straps]
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% The Collector's magnet crane is mounted on the back of his Chevrolet 
% (formerly Geo) Metro.  He takes Lucy, still stuck to the magnet, 
% through the streets of Springfield.

Collector:	[leaning out the window] Care for a Rollo, sweet 
		Xena?
Lawless:	All right Collector, stick this in your tweezers -- 
		I'm not Xena!  I'm an actress, you lunatic!
Collector:	Oh, please, I'm not insane.  I simply wish to take 
		you back to my lair to be my bride.
Lawless:	Oh, dear God!
-- Well, at least he isn't insane, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Meanwhile, Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl fight the battle against 
% yard trash.  Bart rakes the leaves, using the hand he has 
% conveniently transformed into a rake.  Lisa lifts the house up, and 
% Bart sweeps the leaves under the house.
%
% At that moment, the Collector and Lucy drive past.  Lucy yells for 
% help.  They quickly realize that she has been kidnapped.  Bart 
% changes into a pogo stick, and he and Lisa hop off after them.

Marge:	Remember, you're vulnerable to kryptonite.
Homer:	Jeez, Marge, tell the neighborhood.
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% At his lair, the Collector finishes sealing Lawless in a big plastic 
% bag.  A catwalk rings the perimeter of the room, allowing the 
% Collector access to the rest of his collected celebrities.

Collector:	Fear not, my syndicated sweetie.  You'll be 
		preserved forever in this Mylar pouch, forever 
		remaining in ... near mint condition, between Dr. 
		Who and of course Yasmine Bleeth.
Lisa:		I don't think so.  [she and Bart smash through the 
		wall]
Bart:		I don't think so, either.
		[stretches his butt up to the Collector's platform, 
		and waves it in his face]
Lisa:		Your collecting days are over, Collector.
Collector:	[pulls out a phaser] Stop right there.  I have here 
		the only working phaser ever built.  It was fired 
		only once, to keep William Shatner from making 
		another album.
Lisa:		Stretch Dude, help!
Bart:		Just a sec.
		[we see that he has stretched over to look at the 
		Collector's "adults only" collection]
-- Priorities, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% The Collector fires his phaser, hitting Lisa and knocking her out.  
% He turns his attention to Bart, but each time he fires, Bart 
% stretches out of the way.  Finally, the phaser runs out of energy.  
% The Collector throws the weapon at the boy.  It hits Bart on the 
% head, knocking him unconscious.
%
% The Collector ties Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl to a hook, using 
% Stretch Dude's own body as a substitute rope.  They are suspended 
% over a tank of bubbling Lucite.

Collector:	Good night, Retch Dude and Slobber Girl.  Sweet 
		screams!
		[begins to lower them into the Lucite tank]
		[turning to Lawless]  Ha, ha, ha!  I am unbelievably 
		amused.  Soon those bratty buttinskis will be 
		encased in Lucite for all eternity.  While we're 
		waiting, here are some names you may call me on our 
		wedding night:  [clears throat] Obi Wan, Iron Man, 
		Mr. Mxyzptlk, and of course, Big Papa Smurf.
Lawless:	What do you need me for?  You could have your choice 
		of any of the women in these bags.
Collector:	You would think so, but no.
Lawless:	Really?  Well, I mean, maybe we are meant for each 
		other.  Growing up, I was tall for my age and all 
		the other kids made fun of me, I ... I always hoped 
		for another misunderstood soul to share my pain and, 
		you could be that soul, Collector.
Collector:	Oh ...
Lawless:	Come here, you.  Xena needs Xex.  [puckers up]
Collector:	[puckers up]
Lawless:	[grabs Collector's lips]
		Got your lips!
		[punches Collector several times, and kicks him off 
		the catwalk]
Collector:	You tricked me!  With a ruse so hackneyed, it would 
		make Stan Lee blush!
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Lawless jumps down from the catwalk.  Still in her Mylar pouch, she 
% and the Collector fight.  Lawless lands a series of vicious kicks 
% and head blows.
% 
% Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa are still being slowly lowered toward the 
% Lucite.

Lisa:	Bart, just let me drop and save yourself!
Bart:	What do you think I've been trying to do?
-- No honor among superheroes, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Lawless corners the Collector.  He picks up one of his collectibles.

Collector:	Ah ha!  Not even Xena is a match for the double-
		edged lightsaber from "Star Wars Episode 1:  The 
		Phantom Menace!"
		[takes it out of the package and activates it]
Lawless:	[gasps] You removed it from its original packaging!
Collector:	No!  It's no longer a collectible!
		[staggers backward until he crashes through a 
		railing and plunges into the Lucite tank]
Lawless:	[walks up to the railing and frees herself from the 
		pouch]  What a nerd.
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% The Collector climbs out of the tank, covered in Lucite.  He knows 
% the end is near, and strikes a dramatic pose.

Lucite hardening ... must end life in classic Lorne Greene pose from 
"Battlestar Galactica."  Best ... death ... ever!
-- The Comic Book Guy, er, The Collector, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% With evil thwarted for another day, Bart, Lisa, and Lawless gather 
% in front of the comic shop.

Bart:		Wow!  Thanks for saving us.
Lawless:	No problem.  Now let's get you kids home.
		[picks the two up, and begins to fly back home]
Lawless:	Wait a minute -- Xena can't fly.
Lawless:	I told you, I'm not Xena.  I'm Lucy Lawless.
Lisa:		Oh.
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% With a brief reprise of the theme ("Stretch Dude and Clobber 
% Girl!"), the trio flies home.  The world is safe again.  But, for 
% how long?
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  14:12]
%
% The final tale for tonight is a timely one.  We call it:
%
% 			Life's a Glitch, Then You Die
%
% It isn't New Year's Eve without Dick Clark, and tonight he forgoes 
% Times Square to host the festivities in Springfield.  As usual, 
% there's an all-start lineup that includes Whitesnake.  Or maybe 
% Quiet Riot.  Or is that Ratt?
%
% Back at home, the Simpsons and their guests sum up the previous
% millenium.

Abe:	Man alive, what a stink-o thousand years!  Blimp wrecks, 
	teenagers ... then again, we had two TV shows with Andy 
	Griffith.
Marge:	And eleven with Robert Urich.
-- Putting it in perspective, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Rick James performs at Springfield Town Square ...

James:	[singing] Superfreak, superfreak!
	I'm superfreakin', yow!
	[two policemen come up, handcuff James, and lead him away]
	Aw, man, what'd I do now?
Clark:	Wonderful; now that's dedicated to all you supergeeks who 
	rocked around the clock to exterminate America's Y2K bugs.  
	Slammin'!
	[scene shifts to the Simpson house]
Lenny:	Hey Homer, weren't you the plant's Y2K compliance officer?
Homer:	Absolutely.
Carl:	Must've been hard, debugging all those computers, eh, 
	Homer?
Homer:	Doing what, now?
Lisa:	You did fix them, didn't you Dad?  Because even a single 
	faulty unit can corrupt every other computer in the world.
Homer:	That can't be true, honey.  If it were, I'd be terrified.
-- Now *I'm* terrified, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% The big moment arrives, as the crowd counts down the ball drop.  
% (Dick Clark takes a moment to thank Dixie Brand Mayonnaise.)  
% Meanwhile, technicians in a Y2K monitoring center grow alarmed.  It 
% seems that one errant computer -- Homer's -- is causing a cascading 
% series of failures, just as Lisa had foreseen.
%
% Oblivious, the crowd continues to count down.  Their blissful 
% ignorance does not last long.  When the ball touches the town hall's 
% roof, the New Year is declared as ... 1900.  Right on cue, every 
% computer in Springfield goes haywire, and pandemonium ensues.  Dick 
% Clark's skin melts, and we see that he is in reality a robot.  
% Street and traffic lights go on the blink.  The "99 billion served" 
% sign at a restaurant rolls over to "zero served."  The revolving 
% restaurant spins out of control, pinning diners against the glass 
% from centripetal force before launching itself into the sky.  
% Nelson, busy copying his butt, is swallowed up by the copy machine.
%
% At home, Marge is helpless to do anything as planes fall from the 
% sky and land in the back yard.

Well, those ivory-tower eggheads have screwed us again.
-- Homer Simpson, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Homer goes to have a pre-bed glass of milk, but the carton squirts 
% him.  It seems it has a computer chip in it.  So do various 
% household appliances, which go to attack the family.  The 
% refrigerator pelts Homer with ice cubes.  The waffle iron snaps at 
% them like an angry terrier.
%
% At a church service, Reverend Lovejoy delivers a suitably 
% Apocalyptic sermon.

Lovejoy:	Judgement Day is upon us.  I warned you the Lord wouldn't 
		stand for your minidresses and Beatle boots.
Flanders:	[trying to remove a pair of said boots]  I've resisted 
		these for thirty-five years.  Why did I wear them today?
Lovejoy:	But it's not too late to repent your sins and be embraced 
		by the Almighty --
Wiggum:		[runs into the church]  Hey, everybody!  They're looting 
		the mall, hurry!  I've got nine shoe buffers!  [holds one 
		up]
		[the parishioners run out the door]
Homer:		[trying to run, but failing]  I'm caught on something!

		jacket]
Marge:		I don't want you looting.
Homer:		But I was going to loot you a present.
Marge:		[touched] Oh, all right.
Homer:		[giggles and runs off]
-- "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Homer winds up looting a Lady Remington shaver for his wife.  It 
% goes bonkers and tries for Marge's jugular.  She wrests it off her 
% neck, and tosses it onto the grass.  It cuts an irregular path as it 
% goes on a rampage through town.
%
% The family walks through town, past malfunctioning devices of all 
% kinds.

Lisa:	[sarcastic] Well, look at the wonders of the computer age 
	now.
Homer:	Wonders, Lisa, or blunders?
Lisa:	I think that was implied by what I said.
Homer:	Implied, Lisa, or implode?
Lisa:	Mom, make him stop.
-- Stop, Lisa, or stoop?  "Treehouse of Horror X"

% The Simpsons happen upon Krusty, who is having a Y2K crisis of his 
% own.  His pacemaker is stuck in the "hummingbird" mode.  Krusty 
% lifts himself in the air briefly by flapping his arms, before 
% collapsing on the ground.

Bart:	[tearfully] Krusty!  [perks up] Hey, a note.
	[removes it from Krusty's shirt pocket and reads it]
	You have been selected for "Operation Exodus."
Lisa:	They're evacuating the Earth!  We're saved!
Homer:	Thank you, sweet clown.  In death you saved us all.

Krusty:	[offscreen] I'm not dead.
Homer:	I can still hear his voice on the wind.

% Bart is the first to see the Exodus rocket.  A lone sentry stands 
% guard at the bottom of the gantry; his job is to make sure only the 
% invited people get on board.  A long line forms in front of the 
% guard post, and most of the people are A-list celebrities and 
% businessmen:  Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, Michele Kwan, and more.  
% Lisa quickly figures out the plan:  Start a new civilization, seeded 
% with today's "best and brightest" people.  Homer figures that 
% includes the Simpsons.
%
% The move to the head of the line.

Guard:	Name, please.
Homer:	Certainly.  I am ... the, uh, piano genius from the movie, 
	"Shine."
Guard:	Uh-huh.  And your name is?
Homer:	Uh ... Shiney McShine?
Lisa:	Actually, he's Homer Simpson.  That's Bart, I'm Lisa.
Guard:	Lisa Simpson?  Ah, you're the ship's proofreader; welcome 
	aboard.  Now, before you enter, you're going to have to 
	make a very difficult choice.  You're only allowed to take 
	one parent with you--
Lisa:	Mom.
	[Marge (carrying Maggie) and Lisa get in the gantry's 
	elevator]
Marge:	Love you lots.
Homer:	Goodbye, Lisa.  Remember me as I am -- filled with 
	murderous rage.

% The rocket lifts off, and heads to Mars.  Homer and Bart are 
% resigned to their fates.  At least they had "long, full lives."  
% Well, at least Homer did.
%
% Their spirits lift when they see another spaceship, with nobody 
% guarding it.  They quickly run aboard.  Both rockets streak away 
% from the Earth.  Homer looks through a porthole, still unable to 
% believe all the trouble he caused.  Bart advises him to let the past 
% go.

Homer:	All that counts is that we're alive and rubbing elbows 
	with the greats.  [gasps] Ooh, there's Ross Perot, Dr. 
	Laura, Spike Lee.
Bart:	Wait a minute, they're not so great.
Homer:	Okay but there's Dan Quayle, Courtney Love, [increasing 
	panic], Tonya Harding, Al Sharpton, Ah!  Tom Arnold!  What 
	the hell's going on?
Bart:	[looking out porthole] Wait!  Only that ship's going to 
	Mars.  Ours is headed for the sun.
Arnold:	Yeah, ain't that a kick in the teeth?  I mean, my shows 
	weren't great but I never tied people up and forced them 
	to watch.  And I could've, because I'm a big guy and I'm 
	good with knots.
Homer:	So we're all going to die?
Arnold:	'Fraid so, but, hey, the grub's pretty good, huh?  
	[chuckles, and then pours a can of peaches in his mouth]
Homer:	The sun?  That's the hottest place on Earth.
Shore:	Gonna work on my tannage, buddy.
Arnold:	Pauly Shore?  Wow!  Hey, we should do a show together, 
	man.  That's a sure cure for the blues!
-- The cure's worse than the disease, "Treehouse of Horror X"

% Rosie O'Donnell appears, and implores the ship's passengers to sing 
% along to "Clang, Clang, Clang."  Everyone breaks into song, and Bart 
% reassures his Dad that they'll be dead in five minutes.  "Not fast 
% enough," says Homer, and pushes the seat's eject button.  As he and 
% Bart float through the vacuum of space, their heads inflate like 
% balloons.  Offscreen, they pop.  But at least the don't have to hang 
% out with Pauly Shore.
%
% The Halloween credits roll.  Instead of the normal Gracie shush, we 
% hear a scream.

% [End of Act Three.  Time:  21:34]
