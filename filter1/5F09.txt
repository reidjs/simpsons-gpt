% Act one.  In a skyscraper, a man in a business suit delivers the state
% of financial affairs for his company.  Someone in the room coughs.  His
% presentation is not very well-received, and he is promptly carted off by
% security at the nod of a cigar-smoking business leader, who closes the
% blinds and addresses his eight underlings.

Manager: Okay, people.  We need to cook up a new holiday for the summer.
         Something with, eh, gifts, cards, assorted gougeables.
Woman:   How about something religious?  We had great penetration last
         spring with "Christmas II"!
Man:     Ooh, I know, Spendover, like Passover but less talk, more presents!
-- Discussing the new holiday, "Trash of the Titans"

% The businesspeople around the table break into serious discussion, until
% the cigar-smoking man breaks them up. He decides the holiday needs to be
% something warm and fuzzy, like "Love Day," only not so lame.  Cut to OFF
% in their TV room celebrating Love Day.
% Homer opens his gift on the coffee table.  It's a talking toy bear with
% an annoyingly sweet mechanical voice, dressed in a knight's clothing.

Bear:  I'm Sir Loves-A-Lot!  The bear who loves to love.
Homer: They didn't have Lord Huggington?
Marge: It's the same basic bear, Homey.
Homer: [dejected] I guess.
-- It's not a happy Love Day this year, "Trash of the Titans"

% Homer turns the bear on the table around, facing away from him.  He then
% turns away from it.  Bart unwraps his gift; it's a pumpkin with big red 
% lips attached -- a "Kisses Make Me Boogie-o-Lantern".
% He tosses it away.  Santa's Little Helper licks it, and it starts 
% playing cheesy bass-rich electronic music, to which Homer dances.
% It's time to clear up.
% Outside the Simpsons' house, plastic figures stand, including two
% frogs kissing and string quartet of bears playing music.  Back in the 
% kitchen, Lisa packs the garbage can full of Love Day wrapping paper.
% Homer shoves the family's presents into the trash can.

Lisa:  It's full, Dad, that means you have to take out the trash.
Bart:  Yup, that's the rule.  "He who tops it off, drops it off."
Homer: Nuh-uh.  "It isn't filled until it's spilled."
-- King of the code, "Trash of the Titans"

% Homer stomps the garbage down.  Sir Loves-A-Lot's head pokes
% out, saying "I love you...am I ugly?", but is ignored and crammed deeper.
% Homer walks off, whistling.  Later, after the trash has piled up
% considerably (but still hasn't spilled), Bart staples a banana peel to
% the side of the can, seeing as there's nowhere for it on top.  The next
% morning, Homer tries to find a place on the pile of garbage for his "Big
% John's Breakfast Log" wrapper, but can't.  He instead writes "B+" on it
% and puts it on the refrigerator.  As he walks out of the kitchen, he trips 
% on the garbage can, knocking it over and spilling rubbish everywhere. 
% Marge hears it from upstairs, so it's about time Homer takes it out.
% Homer fights with the bag as he takes it out the back door and to the 
% street.

[muttering] Ow, ow, stupid trash, rotten, stinky, hate world, revenge soon,
take out on everyone...
-- Homer taking out the trash, "Trash of the Titans"

% Homer screams.  The bag has emptied out some yellow liquid onto his 
% feet, for which he yells at God.  Meanwhile, the garbage truck passes by,
% stopping for the Flanders' trash.  Homer chases them down the street with 
% the bag, yelling insults.
% The garbage truck stops, its tires screeching.  "Uh, oh," Homer says.  
% It backs up, beeping, until it nears Homer.  Two garbage men get out.
% Homer has a little talk with them.
% Homer comes back into the house, his clothes stuffed with garbage.

Homer: Good news, everyone!  I got in a fight with the garbage men and
       they're cutting off our service!
Marge: Oh, lord, now what are we going to do?  Just let the trash pile up?
Homer: Hey, I'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty
       garbage men.
Lisa:  Dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by
       a simple apology?
Homer: I never apologize, Lisa.  I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am.
-- You're forgiven, "Trash of the Titans"

% At the dinner table, the family finishes pigging out.  Marge gets up
% to take the plates to the kitchen.  Homer and Bart offer to clean up the
% table, and throw the leftovers and some fine China through the window
% onto the pile of garbage.  Later, Ned Flanders walks thorough the Simpsons'
% lawn to the front door.

Easy, Ned...don't breathe in.
-- Flanders, walking through the Simpsons garbage mountain, "Trash of the
   Titans"

% Flanders gets hit by some trash flying out the second story window.
% It was thrown by Homer, who hides in the bathroom with Bart.  Flanders
% explains that Maude's folks are here, so Homer warns him to shut the
% windows before the sun hits diaper hill.
% A tall pile of Maggie's dirty diapers sit in the front lawn.  Rod 
% climbs on top. Ned shouts him off.
% A few days later, the front yard is piled high with garbage.  Marge stands
% at the door with Bart, Lisa, and a package of bacon.
% Marge throws several strips of bacon onto the pile, distracting the rats.
% The children run past the pile on their way to school.  Later that day,
% Marge complains to Homer about the garbage at the dinner table.

Marge: Homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again.
Homer: That's not the way she tells it.
Marge: And the school nurse says Bart has the Plague.
Homer: Eh, it's like the measles.  Good to get it out of the way!
Marge: Homer, this has gone far enough!  Will you please just apologize to
       the garbage men?
Lisa:  Yeah, Dad, you're always telling me and Bart to apologize.
Homer: Yeah, but I'm always secretly disappointed when you do.  Anyway, I
       think those garbage men are starting to crack.
Bart:  I think you're startin' to crack.
Homer: Apologize for that remark!
Bart:  No way.
Homer: Atta-boy!
-- "Trash of the Titans"

% Homer opens his bedroom window and stretches.
% Homer sees his front yard, free of trash, and exclaims "Woo hoo!".  Back
% inside, he tells the good news to his family as Marge gives him a dirty 
% look.

Homer:        This is a very, very proud day for us!  Especially me, your 
              father, me, beat City Hall!  It's just like David and Goliath, 
              only this time, David won!
Lisa's Brain: Oh, I know, I heard it too.  Here's some music. [Beethoven's
              "Fur Elise" plays.]
-- "Trash of the Titans"

% Beethoven's "Fur Elise" plays inside Lisa's head.  Her eyes half closed,
% she breaks into a contented smile.

Homer: And to think, you wanted me to crawl, Marge.  Well, this man
       doesn't crawl, he stands tall, that rhymes, Marge, and you know it
       rhymes, admit it!
Marge: Aw, Homer, you didn't beat City Hall!  They picked up our trash 
       because I wrote a letter of apology to the Sanitation Commissioner,
       and signed your name.  Period.
Homer: [hurt] You signed my name?  I feel so violated.
Marge: You've signed my name lots of times!
Homer: But this isn't like a loan application or a will!  You've signed away
       my dignity!  And I'm going to get it back.  Lisa, do I have my pants
       on?
Lisa:  [still smiling dreamily] Yes.
Homer: Perfect.
-- "Trash of the Titans"

% In the office of the sanitation commissioner for the city of Springfield,
% Homer talks with the commissioner himself, Ray Patterson. Patterson is a
% generally nice guy, but Homer sees it differently, and wants to shake
% things up. Homer walks over to a cage in the office, where a green-colored
% parrot sits on a perch.  He shakes the cage violently. Patterson tries to
% stop him, but doesn't succeed. Homer shakes the parrot cage some more.  It
% chirps in terror.  Patterson and Homer fight with words, and Homer leaves.
% Homer pushes his way through a line, including Jimmy the Scumbag, Patty 
% and Selma, and Freddy Quimby.

Homer: I want to register to run for sanitation commissioner!  And tell 
       the fat cats upstairs that things are gonna change in this town!
Man:   Okay... but this is where you register as a sex offender.
Moe:   [walking in] Aw, geez, there's always a line!
-- Confessions of a bartender, "Trash of the Titans"

[End of act one.  Time: ]

% Act two.  Homer drives his car through the city, while Bart addresses
% the passerby through a speaker on the roof of the car.

Bart:  [over PA] Hey, everybody, vote for my Dad, Homer Simpson.  If you 
       don't, he'll beat us.
Homer: [over PA] Why you little... er... no one's gonna beat you, son.  
       [quieter, but still over PA] You're gonna get such a beating!
-- Where did it go wrong? "Trash of the Titans"

% At the nuclear plant, Homer greets his fellow workers as they come through
% the gates, encouraging them to vote for him.  Lenny and Carl walk up.

Lenny: So, Homer, if we vote for you, what are you going to do different?
Homer: What am I, the answer man?  Just vote for me.
Lenny: [walking off with Carl] Heh, you know, I don't know Ray Patterson,
       but, he's no Ray Patterson!
Carl:  Yeah, Homer's a great nuclear safety inspector, but I don't know if
       I trust him with my garbage.
Lenny: Yeah, that's a peace of mind issue, you know...
-- "Trash of the Titans"

% As Lenny and Carl head off to work, Homer decides that educating these
% "geezers" is a wasted effort, and declares that it's time to "rock the 
% vote"...at a U2 concert at Springfield Stadium.  At the backstage door, 
% Homer attempts to gain entry, disguised in a plaid cap, a jacket, and
% carrying a big brown sack. He gets inside, posing as potato man.
% Backstage, in the control room, a female with a shaven head directs the
% camera crew through a headset.  Homer wanders in and starts messing with the
% controls, where he encounters a female technician. She tries to stop him.
% Homer kicks her (wheeled) chair off camera as she screams.  He then
% manages to rig the controls so that his giant head appears on the three 
% screens behind the stage, interrupting U2's "Pride (In The Name of Love)".
% Homer appears on the large screen, and spreads his message, trying to
% sound hip.  Homer comes out on stage, and the crowd boos him, until Bono
% speaks up.  The rest of the band decide they'll go to Moes for a pint.
% The Edge and Larry stop and look at Adam as they walk off, who whistles 
% and fiddles with a knob on his bass guitar.  Meanwhile, Bono, with Homer at 
% his side, addresses the crowd.

Bono:  Why should they vote for you?
Homer: That's a good question, Bono.  'Cause I'd be the most whack, tripped
       out sanitation commissioner ever!  Can you dig it?
       [The crowd is quiet; we hear some crickets chirping.  After a few
        moments, the crowd begins booing again.  Homer, unsure of what to do, 
        starts dancing half-heartedly.]
-- At the U2 concert, "Trash of the Titans"

[into microphone] Wow, look at him go.  You're the real Lord of the Dance,
Homer.
-- Bono, of U2, "Trash of the Titans"

% Bono motions to some security guards standing by and points to Homer.  
% They take Homer off, kicking and screaming, calling to Bono for help.

[into mic] Don't worry, folks.  He'll get the help he needs.
-- Bono, on Homer, "Trash of the Titans"

% By this time, the rest of the band is back, and they finish the song.
% On the screen above the band, four security guards pummel Homer, punching 
% and kneeing him repeatedly.  Later, in Moe's bar, Homer moans about his 
% problems.

Homer: [melancholy] My campaign is a disaster, Moe. [angry] I hate the
       public so much! [melancholy] If only they'd elect me. [angry] I'd
       make 'em pay! [melancholy] Aw, Moe, how do I make 'em like me?
Moe:   Eh, gee, you're kind of all over the place, Homer, you need to focus 
       here.  You gotta...think hard, and come up with a slogan that appeals
       to all the lazy slobs out there.
Homer: [moans] Can't someone else do it?
Moe:   "Can't someone else do it?", that's perfect!
Homer: It is?
Moe:   Yeah!  Now get out there and spread that message to the people!
Homer: Woo hoo! [walks off]
Moe:   Woah, hey, you didn't pay for the beer.
Homer: "Can't someone else do it?"
       [Moe and Homer laugh together.  As Homer starts to leave the tavern,
        Moe cocks and points a shotgun at him and clears his throat.]
Moe:   Seriously, give me the money.
-- Foreshadowing a la Moe, "Trash of the Titans"

% The next day, standing by the Jebediah Springfield statue, Homer talks
% with the people of Springfield.

% Homer stands before a crowd, and explains his "can't someone else do it"
% philosophy. Homer unveils a banner with his catch-phrase on it.  The crowd
% seems to agree.

% Later, Homer stands behind a podium on stage.  An empty one stands to
% Homer's right.  Patterson hasn't arrived, Homer says he had more important
% things to do, and makes gulping noises and drinks from an imaginary bottle.
% The crowd laughs.  Suddenly, Ray Patterson bursts through the door, panting.
% Patterson arrives late, as Homer jokes with the crowd.

% The crowd discusses the matter with themselves.  Later, a newspaper
% headline informs us of Homer's landslide victory.  Homer, seeing the 
% headline through the window of a newspaper vending machine, says "Woo
% hoo!"

Lisa:  Aren't you gonna buy it, Dad?
Homer: Fifty cents?  Huh, not likely.
-- Homer sees himself on the cover of the newspaper, "Trash of the Titans"

[End of act two.  Time: ]

% Homer whistles as he visits his new office.  He sees Ray Patterson, who
% is just leaving. Homer tries to make peace with him, but fails.
% Ray walks off.  Later, Homer, at his desk, is talking on the phone.  As
% he talks, he motions for the rest of the Simpsons, who have come into his 
% office, to come closer, as he talks on the phone, and finishes his call.
% Homer explains he has a lot of crazy promises to fulfill, and they will.
% With a snap of the fingers, Homer appears on top of a garbage truck
% and directs it out of the Sanitation Department facility.  Music plays, 
% and Homer sings his song to the tune of "The Candyman Can".
% Music continues.
% Krusty laughs nervously as two happy garbage man dispose of his "used up 
% pornography" in their truck, and drive off, waving their hats.  For the 
% next segment of the song, Marge offers one of Maggie's soiled diapers to 
% Bart and Lisa, who refuse it and hold their noses.
% Garbage men rush in and wipe up mustard stains on Chief Wiggum's 
% tuxedo.  At Moe's bar, the band U2 enjoys a beer.
% A garbage man mops the bar counter free of spilled beer.  Another whispers
% to Bono during The Edge's line.  It seems that while sitting at Moe's bar,
% U2's trousers have sagged a bit.
% Outside, a parade of garbage trucks, with Homer at the lead on top of
% a garbage bin, get cheered on by people lining the streets.  Popping their
% heads out of trash cans are Apu, Mel, Ned, and Oscar.
% Bart and Lisa run up to Homer's side, who leads the parade into the
% Springfield Dump.
% When the song ends, we see Homer humming the tune in his office.  The 
% Mayor bursts in angrily.

Quimby: Simpson, you idiot!  You spent your entire year's budget in a month!
        Your department's broke!
Homer:  [panics] Uh...oh no!  Wait!  I think I've got the perfect solution.
Quimby: You'd better!  'Cause those garbage men won't work for free!
Homer:  D'oh!  
-- Bright ideas, "Trash of the Titans"

% At home, Homer is losing confidence.  Marge goes over his expenses while
% sitting on the couch with Bart and Lisa.

Homer: Oh...Patterson was right!  I'm crashing and burning!
       Crashing and burning!
Marge: How could you spend 4.6 million dollars in a month?
Homer: They let me sign checks with a stamp, Marge!  A stamp!
Lisa:  You know, Dad, there's a lesson in all this.  Many cities have
       problems with garbage disposal, and it's time we realize you can't
       just...
Homer: Wait!  Shut up!  I just thought of something!
-- Homer think now, "Trash of the Titans"

% Homer runs out the door and drives away.  The next day, Homer, at his
% desk, is confronted by the sanitation workers.  One holds a baseball bat
% in his hands. They demand their pay.
% Homer opens a briefcase full of money on his desktop.

Homer:       Will cash be okay?
Employee #1: Will it!
Quimby:      [opens office door] Did I hear a, uh, briefcase opening?

% Homer drives with his family at night.

Homer: Okay, before I show you, who wants to guess how I got the money?
Bart:  Dealing drugs?
Lisa:  Drugs?
Marge: I'll have to say drugs, too.
Homer: Close, but you're way off.
-- "Trash of the Titans"

% Homer pulls the car onto an off-ramp to the "Outskirts" of Springfield.
% He shows his family his idea: garbage trucks from around the country are
% lined up, and each dumps its contents in front of a mine shaft.  A bulldozer
% crams the trash inside.
% Bart points at a dump truck from the city of New York, which spills various
% kinds of drug paraphernalia, as well as guns and grenades, on the ground 
% next to the mine shaft.

Marge: Good God, Homer!  You're turning our wonderful little town into
       America's trash hole!
Homer: Marge!  Ixnay on the ashhole-tray!
-- Ashhole? "Trash of the Titans"

% Lisa tells Homer that he can't cram garbage under Springfield forever, but
% Homer insists that he can.  Later, he plays golf with Mayor Quimby.
% Mayor Quimby putts.  Underground, a mound of garbage bubbles up and 
% pushes a section of the green up, knocking the Mayor's putt off its path.
% Out of the hole shoots a stream of garbage.  Quimby runs over to 
% investigate.
% The Mayor turns to Homer, who is driving off in their golf cart.  
% Elsewhere in Springfield, Ned, Rod and Todd prepare to say good-bye to 
% a dear departed pet rabbit, whom they have buried in the yard.
% The ground rumbles, sending the rotting corpse of Mr. Bunny up to ground
% level, its mouth wide open.  Rod and Todd scream.  At the home of Cletus
% and Brandine, a pile of garbage knocks over their outhouse.  Cletus opens
% the door and pokes his head out.

% On the streets of Springfield, chaos erupts, as fire hydrants explode
% garbage water and trash shoots out of mailboxes and manholes.  Outside City
% Hall, where a town meeting is in progress, the statue of Jebediah lies
% overturned in a pile of rubbish.  "Aye!" the crowd shouts at Quimby and 
% Homer, standing on stage at the meeting.  Quimby suggests re-electing
% Ray Patterson.  The crowd lets out a cheer.  A triumphant Mr. Patterson
% strides out onto the stage and stands at the podium while a band plays.

Oh...oh, gosh...you know, I'm not much on speeches, but it's so gratifying to
leave you wallowing in the mess you've made.  You're screwed, thank you, bye.
-- Ray Patterson, "Trash of the Titans"

% Mr. Patterson walks off as the band plays the same song used to introduce
% him.  The crowd stares silently. Quimby reassures the crowd.
% At that very moment, the Mayor's podium explodes, shooting trash into
% the air and soaking him.  It seems the town will have to use... Plan B.
% Quimby reaches into his jacket and extracts a large yellow envelope, 
% breaking the "B" seal.  He opens it.  Later, Homer eats potato chips at
% the front door of his house.

Marge: I can't believe it's come to this.
Homer: Come to what?
Marge: Moving the whole town five miles down the road, it's crazy!
Homer: Yeah, it's something all right.
-- "Trash of the Titans"

% Lisa argues that they'll just trash the new Springfield.
% Homer jumps out the front door, and hops over to Moe's bar, which is
% being driven down the street right next to the Simpsons' house.  As the
% houses pass, Homer throws the empty potato chip bag out the window, which 
% floats through the air.  It lands at the feet of a lone Native American, 
% standing at the side of the road.  A tear wells up in his eye.  Another 
% Indian approaches him and says, "Do yourself a favor; don't turn around,"
% for behind him sits the remains of the old city of Springfield, covered
% in garbage, at which we take one last look.  After a brief pause, a four 
% second off-camera scream is heard, followed by the second Indian's voice.  
% "I told you not to turn around." he says.

[End of act three.  Time:]

% Over the credits, the members of U2 sit on an aeroplane.  The Edge,

Adam:      Look, guys.  I got a Springfield spoon for my spoon collection.
The Edge:  Aw, 'ere we go...
