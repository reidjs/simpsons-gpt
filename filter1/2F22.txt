% when in the far distance he notices a sign.

 Bart: [gasps] "Wet cement"!  Is there any sweeter sign?  Well, maybe

   Woman: Like Stonehenge, this site will forever be a mystery.  Who was
          Bart?  And how did he manage to write his name in solid
          cement?
   Man 1: He must have been much smarter than his sister Lisa -- about
          whom we know nothing.
   Man 2: Say, let's bring him back to life by using technology!

Marge: Bart, you've graffito-tagged public property!
 Bart: It was an accident!
-- It was the best of times, "Lemon of Troy"

% At dinner, Marge scolds Bart in front of the rest of the family.

Marge: I can't believe you vandalized your own hometown, Bart.  What
       would Jebediah Springfield say?
 Bart: I think he'd be cool with it.
Marge: Oh.  Homer, will you please help me make a big deal of this?
Homer: What for?  Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in
       Hollywood.
-- Except Jebediah Hollywood, maybe, "Lemon of Troy"

Marge: Well, I'm just shocked by this whole family.  Whatever happened
       to good old-fashioned town pride?
 Lisa: It's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire.
Marge: Now just a darn minute.  This town is a part of who you are.
       This [holds one up] is a Springfield Isotopes cap.  When you wear
       it, you're wearing Springfield.  When you eat a fish from our
       river, you're eating Springfield.  When you make lemonade from
       our tree, you're drinking Springfield.
 Bart: Mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring Springfield.
Marge: Bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect
       for it.  This town is a part of us all.  A part of us all.  A
       part of us all!  Sorry to repeat myself, but it'll help you
       remember.
        [later, Bart skateboards]

Milhouse: It's clearly booming, Bart.

   Shelby: Look at the weak little baby.  You're stupid, you stupid weak

Kids: Wow!  Frontier times. etc.
 Abe: Shut up!
-- Maybe intimate, but not interactive, "Lemon of Troy"

     Abe: It all began when Jebediah Springfield first came to these

           [flash to pilgrims approaching a hilltop]
Jebediah: People, our search is over!  On this site we shall build a new
          town where we can worship freely, govern justly, and grow vast
          fields of hemp for making rope and blankets.
  Shelb.: Yes, _and_ marry our cousins.
Jebediah: I was -- what are you talking about, Shelbyville?  Why would
          we want to marry our cousins?
  Shelb.: Because they're so attractive.  I, I thought that was the
          whole point of this journey.
Jebediah: Absolutely not!
  Shelb.: I tell you, I won't live in a town that robs men of the right
          to marry their cousins.
Jebediah: Well, then, we'll form our own town.  Who will come and live a
          life devoted to chastity, abstinence, and a flavorless mush I
          call rootmarm?
           [the people divide between Jebediah and Shelbyville]
     Abe: The town of Springfield was born on that day, and to mark that
          sweet moment, our people planted this lemon tree (lemons being
          the sweetest fruit available at the time).

Milhouse: I really agree with you on this one, Bart.

       anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.
 Bart: There's got to be a way to get that tree back...hey, look!  A
       hospital.  Pull in there!  [yanks the wheel]
Homer: Aah!  Oh, great, now I'm upside down.
-- Damn RV showers, "Lemon of Troy"

% Homer2 rides along later and sees the RV parked in the hospital zone.
% "Some thoughtless human being has parked in a hospital zone!" he says,
% driving his toe truck over and hitching the RV to it.  He drives the
% RV into the impound lot, shuts the gate on it, and parks his toe truck
% at home.
%
% Later that night, some shadows creep out of the RV.  "Hee hee hee, no
% one in history has ever done anything _this_ clever," chuckles a
% shadow that sounds like Homer.  They strap the tree to the roof of the
% RV.  "I'll get the gate," says Bart, but as soon as he opens it, an
% alarm goes off.  A ferocious dog runs after Bart, growling.  Homer
% assures Bart he'll take care of it, throwing the dog a steak.  It
% leaps in the air, catches it, and continues after Bart.  "Faster, son!
% He's got a taste for meat now!"  Bart jumps into the RV just in time
% as the dog's snout deforms the metal.

Homer2: Get out here, son.  There's a doin's a-transpiring!  Let's shut
        the gate and seal them in!
  Bart: Gun it, Flanders!
   Ned: It won't start.  Something's draining the battery.
 Homer: [using the oven] Sorry.
-- We eat first, then escape later, "Lemon of Troy"

% They drive toward the rapidly closing gate, barely scraping their way
% out (they lose a bumper and a tire).  Flanders moans, but Bart is
% ecstatic.

      Bart: We made it!
  Everyone: Yay!
     Homer: Woo hoo!
      Bart: Eat my shorts, Shelbyville!
Bart+Homer: Eat my shorts!
       Ned: Yes, eat _all_ of our shirts.
             [Homer2 and Shelby shake their fists at them]
    Homer2: Ooh, you lousy Springfielders, you -- shake harder, boy!
-- That'll learn 'em, "Lemon of Troy"

% As the RV drives through the gate to Springfield, the tree catches on
% the archway and falls off.  They have to back up to get it.

     Abe: And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of
          Springfield.  They had brought the sacred tree back to its
          native soil, and though Flanders was stuck with the impound
          fee, he could easily afford it.
Milhouse: More lemonade, Bart?
    Bart: Absolutely.
           [Milhouse squeezes a tiny bit of juice in a glass]
Milhouse: [pouring sugar in] Say when.
     Abe: There are over fourteen parts of the lemon which are edible...
    Abe2: And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of
          Shelbyville.  They had banished the awful lemon tree forever,
          because it was haunted.  Now let's all celebrate with a cool
          glass of turnip juice.
-- That's why you buy juicers, "Lemon of Troy"

% The kids all grimace as they drink their turnip juice.
