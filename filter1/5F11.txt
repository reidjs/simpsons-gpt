% Otto sits in the bus, while the noise of the kids singing "sixty three

% Annoy Bus Drivers," which he throws out the window.
% Nelson and Bart decide to have a race with fruit to see who's fruit reaches
% the front of the bus first. Bart chooses and apple, Nelson chooses an
% orange. Ralph joins in... with a banana. As the race is coming to an end,
% Milhouse makes a last minute decision to throw a grapefruit into the mix.
% He bowls it, and it surpasses the other fruits, but gets caught under the

% from pushing the pedal down. Instead, it bursts the fruit open, and some
% juice splashes into Otto's eyes -- it burns! The kids have to be Otto's
% eyes if they want to drive safely until Otto gets his vision back, but
% within seconds, Otto has swerved out of control and the bus is plunging
% from the bridge into the ocean far below. The bus makes a big splash, and
% floats on the surface -- but not for long. Water is filling up the bus,
% so Otto declares he must swim for help. But as soon as he gets outside,
% the strong current washes him away on the opposite direction.

Zeppelin rules!

% Bart comes to Milhouse's aid, and the kids watch as the bus sinks. They're

% Soon enough, the kids crawl onto the sandy shores of a remote desert island.

Sherri: This is all Lisa's fault, she started the stupid U.N. club!
  Lisa: Hey! Martin seconded the notion, it's entirely his fault.
Nelson: People, people! Let's not blame eachother! We all know this is
        Milhouse's fault!
-- "Das Bus"

% Everybody agrees, and once again, the kids squabble... until we hear the
% sound of conch shell, coming from Bart, who stands atop a large rock.

What's everyone's problem? I'm glad we're stranded! It'll be just like the
Swiss Family Robinson, only with more cursing! We'll live like kings! Damn,
hell, as kings!
-- Bart, "Das Bus"

% The kids envision a fun in the sun island, with waterslides, "Under the Sea"
% style music, and everyone having a good time. Suddenly the future looks a

Good, let's get to work! Me and Nelson will build the treehouse. Martin, draw
a plan for a coconut radio, and if possible, a coconut Nintendo system.
-- Bart, "Das Bus"

  Lisa: What about the rest of us?
  Bart: You guys gather food for the big feast tonight! And maybe a little

Nelson: Delicious wine?
  Bart: Exactly.

Marge: What exactly is it your company does again?
Homer: This industry moves so fast it's really hard to tell. That's why I need
       a name that's cutting-edge, like CutCo, EdgeCom, Interslice... come on,

Marge: How about... Compuglobalhypermeganet?
Homer: Fine, it's not important...

% Back on the island, Milhouse runs towards the other kids screaming "monster,

% A few moments pass, with no sign of a monster, and everybody comes out of

Milhouse: But I'm hungry now!

% The following morning, Lisa is the first to wake, so she wakes everybody

Milhouse: Oh... sorry, I'm just saying it was either you or the monster.

% Since nobody saw Milhouse eat the food, Lisa rests her case. Nelson, the

% He bursts into fury, punching the hell out of Milhouse. Lisa tells Bart to
% stop him because he's not asking any questions, but Bart allows it.
% Bart's concludes that Milhouse is not guilty, since nobody saw him eat the

% verdict, and pelt stones at Milhouse. Once again, Lisa comes to Milhouse's

% Bart and Lisa reluctantly agree. They reach a huge drop, with a large space

% clash, the monster appears from deeper into the cave! The kids evacuate the

% have forgotten their differences when they notice that the monster, which

% food packaging on it's tusk. Nelson apologises to Milhouse.

  Lisa: Hey, if a boar can survive here, there must be a source of food! Look,

        slime! And there's enough slime for all of us! We're saved!
