% drown out the noise.

% Meanwhile, a truck labeled "Danger: Creamed Corn" brings food to the
% elementary school, which Skinner and Lunch Lady Doris inspect.  Bart,

% of Willy's shed, filling his house with the yellow mush while Willy
% sleeps.

% Later that day, Principal Skinner sits at his desk, talking with Lisa.

Skinner: Lisa, Channel 6 is launching a children's news program.  And

         child.
   Lisa: [gasps] Oh my gosh! [mimicking reporter] Today's top story:

Skinner: Lisa, I've selected you to be that child anchor.
   Lisa: [crosses legs] I know.  I already jumped to that conclusion.
Skinner: Oh.  All right, if you're so smart, tell me who I selected to be
         lunchroom monitor.
   Lisa: [excitedly] Me?
