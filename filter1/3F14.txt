Smithers: [on mike] Testing, testing for Mr. Burns.
	  [to Burns] Here you go, sir, I've warmed up the crowd for
	  you.
   Burns: [in a wooden voice] Welcome employees. Come in!
	   [Smithers holds him a card]
	  The whole night's entertainment is on me.
	   [takes another card] Monty Burns!
	  [all cheer]
-- Burns' moving speech, "Homer the Smithers"

% Everybody takes their seats, Homer wearing a huge foam hat.

Announcer: Welcome, welcome, welcome to an evening of exciting
	   quarter-mile action, action, action! Our first race is a
	   benefit for daredevil Lance Murdoch, Murdoch, Murdoch, who's
	   hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver, liver, liver!
	    [crowd cheers]
    Homer: All right! Liver!
-- Ask the connoisseur, "Homer the Smithers"

% Two hot rods take place on the starting line.  Marge admires the 
% hot rods and asks the kids, "Boy, it sure would be fun to car-pool
% in one of those, huh kids?  I'd be a real hot rod mama, wouldn't I?
% Huh?"  Bart responds with "You missed the race, mama."  Marge watches
% the cars cross the finish line. "Mmm, I wish I'd pay more attention."

% Meanwhile, Smithers is giving Burns a teaspoon of Duff.

   Burns: Smithers, this beer isn't working. I don't feel any younger
	  or funkier.
Smithers: I'll switch to the tablespoon, sir.
-- As long as the bubbles don't burn your tongue, "Homer the Smithers"

Announcer: Coming up next, our feature race: the Nuclear Power Plant
	   Championship. Plant plant!
    Burns: Ah, at last. Smithers, fetch the bi-oculars.
	    [watches the 2-second race]
    Burns: Oh, damnation, tell them to go slower!
 Smithers: Yes sir.
	    [meets the drivers]
	   Hi guys. Uh, can we keep it in first gear for a couple laps?
	    [they take off again, at an awfully low speed]
    Burns: [excited] Go! Go!
	   [mean] Slow down.
	    [the two drivers reluctantly look at each other, but do so]
	    [after crossing the line, they release their parachutes,

    Burns: Excellent.
-- After all, I paid for this, "Homer the Smithers"

% The night is over and everyone walks away. Smithers is about to drive

% smaller one, as it is "ludicrously oversized".
%
% As Smithers goes away, Lenny happens to walk by and decides to thank

   Lenny: [drunk] Eh, Burnsie. This was some swell shindig. Thank you
	  very much!
   Burns: [frightened] Smithers, what's happening?
   Lenny: [even drunker] I had a great time. I just want to shake your

%
% Along on the road, Burns comes out from under the seat.

   Burns: You should've seen the murderous glint in his eyes, Smithers.
	  And his breath reeked of beer and pretzeled bread.
Smithers: I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. This was all my fault.
   Burns: Don't concern yourself. If things had turned ugly, I always
	  had my mace.
Smithers: Don't let me off the hook that easily, sir. I failed you and
	  I'll never forgive myself.
	  [bangs his head on the steering wheel] Never, never, never...
	   [Burns rolls up the window between himself and Smithers]

	  [on phone] Never, never, never!
-- Loyal and persistent, "Homer the Smithers"

% The next morning, at Burns' office.

Smithers: Good morning, sir! To make up for my failure last night, I
	  alphabetized your breakfast; you can start with the waffles
	  and work your way up to the zwieback. And, to prevent
	  newsprint from rubbing off on your hands, I've laminated
	  today's newspaper.
   Burns: I appreciate the thought, but my pen won't write on this. How
	  am I supposed to do the Junior Jumble?
Smithers: Oh, I can't even grovel properly! I'm a buffoon! I don't
	  deserve to live on your planet anymore!
-- By all means necessary, "Homer the Smithers"

% He swipes the head off the water fountain and proceeds to try to
% drown himself. Fortunately for him, Burns drains all the water by
% holding down the cold water button.

   Burns: Pull yourself together, man. I daresay you're in need of a
	  long vacation.
Smithers: No! Don't make me take a vacation! Without you I'll wither
	  and die!
   Burns: That's a risk I'm willing to take.
-- Nothing can stop him, "Homer the Smithers"

Smithers: But what would you do without me, sir?
   Burns: Thuh! I'm not a baby who needs a nursemaid to burp me.
	  [burps] You see?
-- You made your point, "Homer the Smithers"

Burns: Now, I insist that you take a vacation, just as soon as a
       temporary substitute can be found.
	[leads Smithers to the door and closes it]
       [from behind the door] Sheesh.
-- Smithers is overworked, "Homer the Smithers"

% That night, Smithers stays late at his office, busy working on his
% computer.

Smithers: I've got to find a replacement that won't outshine me.
	  Perhaps if I searched the employee evaluations for the word
	  [types] "Incompetent"...
	   [computer reports: 714 matches found]
	  714 names? Better be more specific. [keeps typing] "lazy",
	  "clumsy", "dim-witted", "monstrously ugly"
	   [computer searches, then reports: 714 matches found]
	  Oh, nuts to this! I'll just go get Homer Simpson.
-- His reputation precedes him, "Homer the Smithers"

% At home, OFF is shoving down their food as usual...

 Lisa: Mom, I just said that.
Marge: [sarcastically] Soooorry! Next time get your own darn corn.
-- Broken Record time, "Homer the Smithers"

% The next day, at SNPP, Homer is getting used to Smithers' office.

   Homer: Um, is this the chair I'll be sitting on?
Smithers: Yeah.
	   [Homer plays with the chair]
	  Now, I realize caring for Mr. Burns seems like a big job,
	  but... actually it's just 2,800 small jobs.
   Homer: Uh huh. But this _is_ the chair, right?
Smithers: Your new duties will include: answering Mr. Burns' phone,
	  preparing his tax return, moistening his eyeballs, assisting
	  with his chewing and swallowing, lying to Congress, and some
	  light typing.
-- Typing? My whole plan down the--, "Homer the Smithers"

% The phone rings...

Smithers: [answering] Montgomery Burns' office. Oh, hello Mrs. Burns.
	  I'll see if your son is available.
   Homer: Mr. Burns has a mother? She must a hundred million years old!
Smithers: She has limited capacities. All she can do is dial and yell.
-- Does she watch `Matlock'?, "Homer the Smithers"

Smithers: I'm sorry, Monty can't come to the phone right now. He's in a

   Homer: [chuckles] Taft, you old dog.
-- "Homer the Smithers"

% Smithers is brushing Burns' teeth.

   Burns: [spits] Really Smithers, I'll be fine. I'm sure your

	  anyway?
Smithers: Uh, Homer Simpson, sir. One of your organ banks from sector

	  him in some way.
   Burns: Simpson, eh?
-- Rings a bell?, "Homer the Smithers"

% Smithers is packing his luggage in the airport van.

Smithers: Well, the van's leaving; which one duty is giving you the
	  most trouble?
   Homer: Um... what do I do in case of fire?
Smithers: [muffled from inside the van] Sorry, can't hear you. Bye!

Homer: Uh, Smithers already left, sir. I'm his replacement, Homer

Burns: Ah yes, Simpson.
-- Well, they both have four fingers, "Homer the Smithers"

Burns: I'll have my lunch now. A single pillow of Shredded Wheat, some

Homer: But I think the dodo went extinct...
Burns: Get going! And answer those phones, install the computer system,

-- Efficiency at its best, "Homer the Smithers"

% Next morning, Homer wakes up at 4:30, and tries to put on his pants.

Marge: Hmm, poor Homie. Poor, poor... [snores]
-- How compassionate, "Homer the Smithers"

% Homer walks in Burns' kitchen, and is lost by the diversity and

% my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damn
% breakfast he ever ate." He tries to cook a shish kebab on the burner,
% but is puzzled when the whole thing ends up in flames. As his next
% attempt, he breaks the window of the microwave door, and inserts
% another shish kebab. The waves going through his arm don't seem to
% affect him, but this time it's the microwave which is burning. As a
% last resort, he pours some Corn Flakes and milk in a bowl, and gets
% annoyed when this breakfast ends up in the same way as his previous

% Homer responds in kind by throwing a punch. Smithers counterattacks
% with a punch aimed at Homer's stomach, but his fist is stuck in that
% blob of fat. Homer takes the opportunity to taunt Smithers' head, but
% shouts out a well-deserved "D'oh!" when his opponent bites him.
%
% Burns tries to get their attention by blowing a paper bag, throwing a
% glass of water on them, and poking them with a stick.  Smithers
% "teaches" Homer how to use a phone by repeatedly slamming him with
% the receiver. Frightened, Burns finds refuge on top of his stuffed
% polar bear.
%
% Homer runs towards Smithers shouting "I'll show you!", but Smithers
% knows a few tricks: he opens Burns' safe and slams the door into
% Homer's face. Stunned, he walks back and hits the bear, which falls
% through the window and crashes into the ground, bringing Burns with
% him.  "Oh my..." Smithers says.

% That night, at his manor, Burns is resting at bed, wearing several
% casts.

Smithers: [feeding him] Here comes the endangered condor into the power
	  lines... I've got Bobo hot from the dryer. Careful not to burn
	  yourself on his eye.
   Burns: I don't need you to do any of this. I'm totally self-reliant
	  now. What I would like though is a Spanish peanut.
	   [Smithers hands him one]
	  Skin?
	   [Smithers skins it and puts it in Burns' mouth]
   Burns: [chewing] It's a remarkable thing, in the short time you were
	  gone, I learned to be completely self-reli...
	   [Smithers feeds him another peanut]
	  ...ant.
	  Oh, and as for that brutish fellow who knocked me out the
	  window, see that he gets what's coming to him.
Smithers: I already have, sir.
	   [Homer and his family enjoy a huge "Thank You" basket]
    Bart: What did you get that for?
   Homer: For knocking Mr. Burns out of a 3rd story window.
    Bart: Makes sense to me.
    Lisa: Did he die?
   Homer: What am I, a doctor?
-- Looks like it's back to our wacky adventures, "Homer the Smithers"
