B: Maggie!  Maggie!  In here!

% Maggie looks around, unable to find the source of the voice.

% along the way), putting her eye right up against the keyhole.

B: Maggie, go... get... help...

B: I can't take it any more!  I've gotta get out of this closet!

% Bart tries to break down the door.  (*whump*)  He finally busts
% out on the third try and emerges into daylight.  His eyes are
% still dazed from the experience.

B: I give up.  I'll do chores!

% Bart's eyes clear up, and he spots a note on the table.

B: Huh?

% He picks it up, and we read it with him.

B: [reading]  Dear Bart, The family has gone out for frosty chocolate
    milkshakes.  Sorry we couldn't find you.  Love...

% Bart looks out the window, just in time to see the car pull out of the
% driveway (with Maggie in the back seat).

B: ... Dad.

% He tosses the note aside, walks into the closet, and shuts the door.
