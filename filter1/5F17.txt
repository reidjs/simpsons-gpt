% Ah, another beautiful Springfield morn. Bart and Milhouse walk through a
% busy street together.

Milhouse: Hey Bart, what's your favorite thing about teacher's conference day?
    Bart: Hmmm, I'm guess that we don't have to go to school.
Milhouse: Woah, mine too!
-- Very haunting, "Lost Our Lisa"

% They pass Barney, who is dressed very sharply.

Morning, boys. Can't stop to chat; time is money!
-- Barney on the way to Moes, "Lost Our Lisa"

% While the teacher's enjoy a rollercoaster ride, Bart and Milhouse visit the
% joke shop. The doorbell squirts water in Milhouse's face, and the door
% handle punches Bart in the gut.

Milhouse: Check it out, Bart, x-ray specs! [looks at the clerk, who appears
          exactly as before through the spectacles] Hey, these don't work!
   Clerk: Uhh, lead shirt.
Milhouse: I'll take three pairs! Here's my prescription!
-- At the joke shop, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Bart messes around with a fire extinguisher that shoots snakes.

Maybe you can help me. I don't think my face is hilarious as it could be.
-- Bart at the joke shop, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Soon enough, Bart looks a lot more hilarious than before. He has a colorful
% beak, screws in his neck, huge teeth and a faucet on his head. The
% accessories fall off instantly.

Milhouse: If you put dog doo on the suction cups they'll stick better.
    Bart: Milhouse, I'm not gonna take dog doo that's been on the dirty ground
          and put it on my face.
-- Healthy thinking, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Bart has a better idea. They go to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,
% Sector 7G, where Homer is sleeping on the job.

 Bart: Hey dad, wake up!
Homer: [wakes up] Huh, what? I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm a productive member of
       the team! You can't fire me, I quit! Pleeaase, I have a family!
 Bart: Relax, dad, it's just me.
-- Homer sleeping on the job, "Lost Our Lisa"

 Bart: I was wondering if you had any industrial strength adhesive I could use
       on my face.
Homer: Well, let's see what we've got in the old drawer! [shuffles things
       around in the drawer] Aha, there's some glue! [Homer pulls the glue,
       which is stuck to the bottom, out with great, great struggle, taking
       a big chunk of the drawer with it.] Hope this stuff holds.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Back at home, Lisa is excited about going to the Egyption artifacts exhibit.

Just let me put some film in the camera and we'll hop in the car! You can get
a picture of your mommy with a mummy!
-- Marge about to go to the Egyption artifacts exhibit with Lisa.

% Just as Marge and Lisa are about to leave, Bart arrives home. Marge tells
% him to take the accessories off his face, but they won't come off. Marge
% finds the super-glue.

Mom, I didn't eat any of it. I'm not stupid.
-- Bart, upon super-glueing some accessories to his face, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Marge cancels her day out with Lisa so she can rush Bart to the hospital.
% Lisa asks if she can take the bus to the exhibit.

A bus? Alone? Absolutely not! It's just too dangerous for an eight year old.
In a few years when you're old enough to drive, then you can take a bus!
-- Marge responding to Lisa's request to take a bus, "Lost Our Lisa"

% The car leaves, and Lisa is sad -- until she has an idea. She phones Homer
% at work.

Homer: Yellow?
 Lisa: Dad?
Homer: Who is this?
 Lisa: It's Lisa! I just called to tell you how much I love you and can I
       take the bus to the museum?
Homer: Museum? I don't like the sound of that... what did your mother say?
 Lisa: Umm, I wasn't one hundred percent clear on that. She said something,
       but she was kind of in a rush to get Bart to the emergency room.
Homer: Hmmm, so you wanna take the bus, huh? I don't know, that's a pretty
       big decision.
 Lisa: Well, if it would put your mind at ease I could take a limousine. But
       that would cost $200.
Homer: $200?! Ohh, isn't there any other way?
 Lisa: Hmmm, I guess I could take the bus if you think that's a better idea.
Homer: Frankly, I do. I know you had your heart set on the limo but sometimes
       daddy's have to say no, honey! I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the
       bus.
 Lisa: [fakely sad] Alright.
Homer: Atta girl, I love you s--
       [Lisa hangs up]
 Lisa: Yes!
-- Lisa on the phone to Homer, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa goes to the bus stop.

Lisa: Ahh, the old number 22. Clean, reliable public transportation. The
      chariot of the people. The ride of choice for the poor and very poor
      alike. Sure, some folks prefer--
 Moe: Uh, you gettin' on this next bus, kid?
Lisa: Yes!
 Moe: [whistles] Taxi! [gets into taxi] VD clinic.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa gets onto the bus and looks for a seat.

 Lisa: May I sit there?
Agnes: Of course not, honey! That seats for my coin purse. [She puts her
       coin purse down. After Lisa leaves she picks it back up.]
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% She tries somewhere else.

          Lisa: May I have that seat?
Comic Book Guy: Yes! If you can answer me these questions three. Question
                the first!
          Lisa: Never mind. [walks away]
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa remains on the bus for a while, as the bus stops at various stops.
% After a while, Lisa is the only passenger on the bus and she is far from
% Springfield. The bus driver tells her she's on the wrong bus if she wants
% to go to the museum, and that she has to get out the bus -- it's the end of
% the line.

% In the hospital Bart and Marge wait to be seen. Another boy with a faucet
% stuck to his walks by -- only he was caught in a plumbing explostion.

That's the kind of faucet I want for your bathroom!
-- Marge sees a boy with a faucet stuck in his head, "Lost Our Lisa"

% After a while Lisa comes to what appears to be Area 51! She speaks to a
% security guard there.

          Lisa: Huh, how could I confuse bus 22 with 22-a. Area 51! Hah!
                I found Area 51!
                [steps aside from sign revealing the letter "A"]
Security Guard: No, ma'am, this is Area 51-A.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% The security guard refuses to tell Lisa where she is.
% She continues to wander.

Stupid bus can't even go to the stupid place it's supposed to stupid go!
-- Stupid Lisa, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa sees a dead animal. Cletus shovels it onto the back of his truck,
% where there is a big pile of dead animals.

I saw him first! Curly Sue's gonna have an elegant wedding feast!
-- Cletus collecting dead animals, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa asks for a ride.

Brandine: [looking out of the truck window] Cletus, what are you beating your
          gums about?
  Cletus: Never you mind, Brandine! You just go back to birthing that baby!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa can have a ride, but she has to sit in the back with the dead animals,
% including a skunk which can "go off" even after it's dead. Lisa runs away.

% Back in Springfield, Dr. Hibbert inspects Bart's face.

Young man, there's nothing funny about novelties. [laughs] I mean, they're
humorous and all, but this is certainly no laughing matter. [laughs]
-- Dr. Hibbert, treating Bart's novelty ridden face, "Lost Our Lisa"

      Marge: Can you help him, doctor?
Dr. Hibbert: Oh my yes. Why, if I had seventy five dollars for every
             novelty I removed-- oh, by the way, I'll need a check for
             seventy five dollars.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Dr. Hibbert decides the only way to remove the novelties is by a painful
% injection into Bart's spine. The medical apparatus looks very intimidating
% (many sharp points pumping back and forth). As Dr. Hibbert gets closer, the
% novelties fall off!

      Marge: What happened? You didn't do anything!
Dr. Hibbert: Oh, didn't I? [laughs] Nothing dissolves glue better than human
             sweat. I knew Bart would panic and start perspiring at the sight
             of this button abricator!
       Bart: Couldn't you have just turned the heat up a little?
Dr. Hibbert: [sinister] Oh, heavens no! It had to be terror sweat!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% At the power plant, Homer enjoys lunch with Lenny and Carl. Carl is wearing
% a large hat that looks like a pyramid.

 Carl: So, uh, ain't you guys gonna ask me about my hat?
Lenny: Oh! Hey, Carl, what's with the hat?
 Carl: Oh, what, this thing?
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

I got it down at the museum. It's what the Ancient Egyptions call a
"souvineer".
-- Carl, "Lost Our Lisa"

% When Lenny and Carl find out Homer let Lisa take the bus alone, they are
% digusted with him.

Lenny: [spits out food] You sent your little girl downtown on a bus?
 Carl: Alone?
Homer: Maaaaybe... but you don't know Lisa, I mean, she's so smart they
       hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach her some things, but
       she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and
       caught on fire!
 Carl: That never, uh, happened, did it Homer?
Homer: Yes, but now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter. [runs away]
       Oh Lisa!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa walks around the Russian district of Springfield. She walks over to
% two chess players.

 Lisa: Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the museum?
  Man: [Shouting in Russian. Dialogue is translated at bottom of screen]
       My pleasure. It's six blocks that way. [Lisa runs away.]
  Man: [Shouting] Hey, she went the wrong way.
Man 2: Checkmate. [the other man throws the chess board to the ground.]
  Man: [Shouting] Good game. How about another?
-- "Lost Our Lisa"


 Everywhere she goes, strange people
% try to sell her things. She goes a phone booth and calls Homer, but his
% answer machine answers the call.

    Homer: You have reached the office of Homer Simpson. If you are calling
           about the waterbed, please leave a detailed message. If you need--
Mr. Burns: Get back to work!
    Homer: [screams, we hear the dial tone]
-- Homer's answer machine message, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Another strange local scares Lisa away.

% Homer runs through the museum looking for Lisa, but she is nowhere to be
% seen. He stands in the middle of the road begging for someone to have seen
% Lisa.

       [a car pulls up]
Homer: For God sakes, my little girl is--
       [the window rolls down, revealing Marge]
       Agh! Hello!
Marge: Homer, what's going on, shouldn't you be at work?
Homer: I am at work.. this is what I do! Get moving Marge, this isn't a
       parking lot!
Marge: Sorry! [drives away]
-- Homer looking for Lisa, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Another car arrives. Mr. Burns rolls the window down.

    Homer: Agh!
Mr. Burns: Shouldn't you be at work right now?
    Homer: Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Burns, sir...
Mr. Burns: Well, then get back to wherever it is you work, whoever you are.
-- Homer is caught away from work, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Homer asks Chief Wiggum (who is dressed in drag) for help, but he's in the
% middle of a stakeout. Snake steals his purse.
% The streets are simply too busy for Homer to see Lisa.

Homer: This is no good, I gotta get up higher! [walks over to a balloon
       salesman] Give me all of your balloons. [the salesman hands him a
       dozen or so balloons] I hope this works... [walks to guy in a cherry
       picker] These are for you if you let me use your cherry picker!
  Guy: Well, I've already got some balloons, but.. they're not this nice.
       Deal!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Homer gets in and raises himself above the crowd. Once up there, he spots
% Lisa. He tells her he's coming down, but instead he sends the cherry
% picker speeding down a hill and towards a river. The vehicle ends up in
% the water. Lisa gets a the man behind the drawbridge controls to bring it
% down, and tells Homer to hold on. Instead, his head gets caught in between
% the two sides.
% Homer and Lisa walk away.

 Lisa: Are you sure you don't wanna go to a doctor? I mean, a drawbridge did
       close on your head...
Homer: No, I'll just walk it off.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% As they drive home, Lisa regrets what she did.

 Lisa: I'll never take another stupid risk like that again.
       [Homer stops the car]
Homer: Don't ever say that!
 Lisa: What?
Homer: If I hadn't of taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker I would
       have never found you!
 Lisa: I guess...
Homer: Stupid risks are what make life worth living!
-- Father of the year, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Homer explains that stupid risks are the reason for his many adventures.
% The car starts rolling backwards towards the river.

 Lisa: Dad, you're headed for the river again!
Homer: [laughs] Feel your heart pumping a mile a minute! That's what my
       heart's doing all the time! I bet your left arm's tingling too.
-- Actually... "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa says she wants to go to the exhibit, but it's closed. Homer decides
% it would be a stupid risk trying to get in, and that they should do it!

Feeling stupid? I know I am!
-- Homer, "Lost Our Lisa"

% They head for the museum.

% Marge, Bart and Maggie arrive home. Marge tells Bart to go and apologise
% to Lisa for making her miss the exhibit. Bart goes upstairs and stands
% outside Lisa's door.

 Bart: Hey Lis, I'm sorry I ruined your Egyption thing. We're still buds,
       right? [we see her room -- it's empty] OK, be that way, you big stupid
       jerk! Oh, you're not the jerk. I am. Forgive me? Oh, like you're miss
       perfect. Mom! Lisa's making me feel bad!
Marge: [from downstairs] Stop it, Lisa!
 Bart: That shut her up.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% At the museum, Homer and Lisa are climbing up a display outside. Security
% is on the lookout, but nobody has noticed them. They make their way to a
% window a floor or so up.

Could you open the window? The cops have daddy's prints on file.
-- Homer, as he and Lisa break into the museum, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa does so, and they go inside. They sneak down a corridoor into the
% exhibit. Lisa is taken aback by it's beauty.

 Lisa: Have you ever seen such exquisite ushabtis?
Homer: [not following] Eh, not this exquisite.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa spots something else.

 Lisa: Oh my gosh! It's the mysterious Orb of Isis! Archeologists have
       been studying it for decades and still have no clue what it means!
Homer: Well, daddy will figure it out!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

Oh, we can't touch it, dad! It's behind a velvet rope! [feeling the rope]
A velvet rope..
-- Lisa, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Homer goes for it, but knocks down the velvet rope, which in turn knock
% the Orb from it's display. It falls to the ground and opens, looking
% broken, but begins playing music -- it's a music box!

 Lisa: It's a music box! Dad, we uncovered the secret!
Homer: Oh, so now it's <we>, eh?
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

 Lisa: It's so beautiful! And just think, we're the first people to hear
       it's song in more than four thousand years! [they hug] Thanks for
       making me take such a stupid risk, dad!
Homer: Any time, honey. Just remember, never be afraid to live life on the
       edge. Now let's get home before your mother kills us!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Homer closes up the orb and puts it back.

 Lisa: It's kind of humbling, isn't it? The music we just heard might never
       be heard again.
Homer: Yeah, but it'll always live on because we'll never forget it. [begins
       whistling]
 Lisa: Dad, that's the Old Spice song!
Homer: It is? Well, that's a good song too! [continues the song, and Lisa
       joins him]
