Children: Ew!
  Hoover: What _is_ it?
    Bart: [disguising his voice] It's a cow's heart.  [changing voices]
          They're trying to make a monkey out of you.  [Lisa smiles]
 Skinner: Alison, is this supposed to be some kind of joke?
  Alison: I didn't do that...I made a different one.
 Skinner: Oh, is that so, young lady?  Where is this "phantom diorama"?
  Alison: Uh, I don't know...
           [Lisa hears a heart beating, and looks worried]
 Skinner: Aw, at least have the guts to take the blame, girl.  You're
          only compounding your folly by lying about it.
    Bart: Right on!
 Skinner: Young lady, cow hearts belong in a butcher's window, not the
          classroom.
           [Lisa hears the heart getting louder, frets]
          Well, maybe in an older students' biology classroom, but
          that's none of my business.  Elementary school is where I
          wound up, and it's too late to do anything about that!
-- Losing track of the point, "Lisa's Rival"

% Skinner confesses he's starting to regret having skipped Alison ahead,
% and she sobs.  Meanwhile, the heartbeat is getting louder in Lisa's
% ears.  She looks down to see the trap door beating too.  Alison sobs a
% bit more, then Lisa loses it and screams.

   Lisa: Aah!  It's the beating of that hideous heart!
          [everyone looks at her]
         I mean, I think I hear something.
          [opens trap door, retrieves diorama]
         Why, here's Alison's real diorama.  It got misplaced...[laughs
         a bit] or so it would seem.
Skinner: Oh, well, that changes everything.  Let's have a look.
         [quietly to Miss Hoover] Get the ribbon ready.
          [pulls sheet off]
         Oh...a little...sterile...no _real_ insight.  What do you
         think, Miss Hoover?
 Hoover: Ehh.
          [Lisa gasps, looks at Alison]
Skinner: This has been a very disappointing day.  All right, on to Lisa
         Simpson.
   Bart: You're a shoo-in now, Lis.
   Lisa: After the way I've behaved, I don't deserve to win.
Skinner: Well, this doesn't deserve to win.
   Lisa: What?
-- Just desserts, "Lisa's Rival"

Skinner: Ooh, now we're into the dregs.  Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry.
          [pulls sheet off]
         Pre-packaged "Star Wars" characters, still in their display
         box?  Are those the limited-edition action figures?
  Ralph: What's a diorama?
Skinner: Why it's Luke, and Obi-Wan, and my favorite, Chewie!  They're
         all here!  [to Miss Hoover] What do you think?
 Hoover: [bored] I think it's lunch time.
Skinner: We have a winner!
-- Nonbiased judging, "Lisa's Rival"

% The children cheer as Lisa and Alison look at each other in disbelief.
%
% After school, Lisa apologizes to Alison for her egregious behavior.

  Lisa: I'm really sorry about what I did, Alison.  It's no shame being
        second to you.
Alison: Thank you, Lisa.  You know, I'm actually kind of glad I lost.
        Now I know that losing isn't the end of the world.  Hey, you
        still think we can be friends?
  Lisa: Only if we're the best.
 Ralph: [skipping with his diorama] I beat the smart kids!  I beat the
        smart kids!  I -- [trips]
         [unhappy] I bent my Wookie.
  Lisa: Hey Ralph, want to come with me and Alison to play "Anagrams"?
Alison: We take proper names and rearrange the letters to form a
        description of that person.
 Ralph: My cat's breath smells like cat food.
