No sports, no rock, no information,
For mindless chatter, we're your station!
-- KBBL radio's jingle, "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

% The scene shifts to Homer eating donuts at the power plant.

Announcer: KBBL talk radio.  And now Springfield's favorite conservative
           and author of the well-selling book, "Only Turkeys Have Left
           Wings."  Ladies and gentlemen, Birch Barlow.
     Carl: Ecch!  That Barlow's a right-wing crackpot.  He said Ted
           Kennedy lacked integrity!  Can you believe that?
    Lenny: Yeah, switch the station.  I consider myself politically
           correct, and his views makes me [shivers] uncomfortable.
    Homer: Nonononono, guys...I'm not very political -- I usually think
           people who vote are a bit "fruity" [Lenny and Carl walk off]
           -- but for some reason this Birch Barlow really speaks to me.
           [chomps, chews]
            [scene shift to inside KBBL; Birch chows on donuts too]
   Barlow: Good morning, fellow freedom-likers.  Birch Barlow, the
           fourth branch of government, the fifty-first state...
-- Less-than-subtle parodies, "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

Barlow: You know, there are three things we're never going to get rid of
        here in Springfield: one, the bats in the public library --
         [scene switch to man opening card catalog and screaming as bats
        fly out]

         [scene switch to huge compost pile and Mrs. McFierly rocking

        -- and three, our six-term mayor,
         [scene switch to Quimby watering a marijuana plant]
        the illiterate, tax-cheating, wife-swapping, pot-smoking,
        spendocrat Diamond Joe Quimby.
Quimby: Hey: I am no longer illiterate.
-- Slow but steady self-improvement, "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

Barlow: Now, why are we doomed to this Quimby Quagmire, you ask, oh
        reasonable listener?  Because this town is under the
        stranglehold of a few tie-dyed tree-huggers who would rather
        play hackeysack than lock up the homeless.
-- Those wonderful conservative theories, "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

% The scene shifts to Simpson kitchen with Bart eating, Lisa taking
% notes, and Marge feeding a resistant Maggie.

   Marge: [hearing radio] Mmm...this sounds awfully controversial.
          Lisa, you _know_ I don't like controversy in this house.
    Lisa: I don't like him either, Mom, but I'm doing a report on local
          politics for my school project.
    Bart: You think you're so big because your class always gets to do
          projects.  [condescending] Well, um, I'm doing a school
          project on, er, fireworks.  [displays a bundle]
   Marge: Mmm...Bart, I wish you wouldn't lie like that.  [takes bundle,
          douses it in sink, throws it away]
           [at school]
 Skinner: And now, as a special sendoff and a way to say "Gong Hei Fatt
          Choy" to our visiting Chinese principals, Bart Simpson has
          promised us a fireworks display.  [motions to Bart]
           [Bart looks at Edna and groans as she gives him "F"]

        bleeding-heart smellfare program.
  Lisa: Dad, I had to listen to this jerk all morning.  Can we listen to
        something else?
 Homer: When _I'm_ driving the car, _I_ get to choose the radio station.

% They do indeed switch back as Barlow takes a phone call from a
% listener.

Barlow: All right, my friends, let's go to the phones.  First up is Bob
        from South Springfield.  Welcome to you, sir.
   Bob: Hello, Birch.  Long-time listener, first-time caller.  Kudos for
        bringing the public back to the Republican party.  It's high
        time people realized we conservatives aren't all Johnny
        Hatemongers, Charlie Bible Thumps, or even -- God forbid --
        George Bushes.
  Lisa: [gasps] That sounds like Sideshow Bob!
 Homer: Yes, ma'am.  Sideshow Bob, yakking it up on the old yak box.
  Lisa: Dad, I'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't
        know who Sideshow Bob is.
 Homer: Phew!
-- Lisa, making it easier on Daddy, "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

% Lisa explains, with the help of flashbacks, who Sideshow Bob is.

 Lisa: Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty the Klown's sidekick.  In 1990 he
       framed Krusty for armed robbery and Bart got him put in jail.
Homer: Uh huh.
 Lisa: When he got out, he married Aunt Selma and tried to murder her.
Homer: Oh, Side_show_ Bob.

 Bart: Aah!  [tosses radio out window]
Marty: And now, "The Funny Five"!
 Lisa: I meant your _other_ mortal enemy.  Sideshow Bob.
 Bart: [gasping] Sideshow Bob?  Oh.  I'm only ten and I already got two
       mortal enemies.
-- It's not clear which is more frightening, "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

Jasper: Yeah, give us something we like or we'll ride you out of town on

Jasper: Sleep.
   Man: Sexy dames, and plenty of 'em.

% Bart listens to a walkman in class.

   Bob: [on the radio] But it would be terribly myopic of me to blame
        all my current woes on one spiky-haired little simpleton.
Barlow: Mm hm, myopic.  Or to say the least, intransigent.  Now you
        mentioned some woes there.
   Bob: Well...you see, Birch, I'm presently incarcerated.
         [scene switch to prison where a riot is taking place]
        Convicted of a crime I didn't even commit.  Hah!  Attempted

% The scene switches to Moe's, where everyone listens to the radio.

Barlow: [on the radio] My friends, Bob is a political prisoner.  I want
        every loyal listener to do everything they can to get him out of
        jail.
   Moe: All right, you heard the man.  [pulls out a box] One grenade
        each.  [hands them out]
Barney: Moe, I think he meant through nonviolent, grassroots political
        action.
   Moe: Aw, geez, really, you think so?  [pause] All right, give 'em
        back.  [everyone moans] C'mon, everybody, give 'em back.  Hey.

% The headline on the Springfield Shopper reads, "Bob Pardon: #1 Local

         exactly as he's told.
 Barlow: Monty, I'm way ahead of you.  If you'll just open that door

   Bob: Hello, children.  [with malice] Hello, Bart.
  Bart: Eep.
   Bob: Young friends, my opponent, Joe Quimby, is confused about your
        school system.  Do you know what he does?  He flip-flops.
         [does backflips; children marvel]
        Sometimes he doesn't know whether he's coming or going.

% At the Town Hall, court is called into session.  Lionel Hutz waits for
% Sideshow Bob to be led into the room.  The Mayor walks in as everyone
% gasps, and he glances sideways at the Simpson children, who look away
% nervously.

Hutz: Mr. Mayor, is it true you rigged the election?
 Bob: No, I did not.
Hutz: [pause] Kids, help.
       [the judge shrugs]
 Bob: Oh, I don't mind.  We want these children to feel justice has been
      served.  That way they can sleep soundly tonight on their hard,
      feculent motel pillows.
-- I'd have preferred the term, "Unsoft, somewhat rotten motel head
    rests", "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

 Bob: Well Bart, Lisa...here I am.
Lisa: I have a plan.  I think we can trap him.
       [they walk up; Lisa takes a sip of water]
      You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you when you say you're
      innocent.
 Bob: Indeed I am.
Lisa: Because we all know you're a naive pawn -- puppet, if you will --
      of the most diabolical political genius Springfield has ever
      known: Birchibald T. Barlow!
       [Barlow stammers incoherently]
      You don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do
      you?
Bart: You were just Barlow's lackey.
Lisa: You were Ronny to his Nancy!
Bart: Sonny to his Cher!
Lisa: Ringo to his rest of the Beatles!

% Bob can't stand it any longer.

  Bob: Enough!  Lies, lies, lies!  I did it!  I did it all!
        [everyone gasps]
       There.
 Bart: We want the truth!
  Bob: You want the truth?  You can't handle the truth.  No truth-
       handler, you.  Bah!  I deride your truth-handling abilities.
Judge: Will you get to the point?
-- "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

  Bob: Only _I_ could have executed such a masterpiece of electoral
       fraud.  And I have the records to prove it!  Here, just look at
       these -- [pulls out binders and floppy disks] each one a work of
       Machiavellian art.
Judge: But why?
  Bob: Because you _need_ me, Springfield.  Your guilty conscience may
       force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside you secretly
       long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize
       criminals, and rule you like a king.  That's why I did this: to
       protect you from yourselves.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a
       city to run.
Judge: Bailiffs, place the mayor under arrest.
  Bob: What?  Oh yes, all that stuff I did.
-- Mayor Bob digs his own grave (and saves), "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

% Lisa is jubilant as Bob is handcuffed.

Lisa: Bart, we did it!  Now we get to keep our house and you get to go
      back to the fourth grade.
Bart: Oh, tomorrow we were going to find out who the dish ran away with.
Lisa: The spoon, Bart.
Bart: [gasps, smiles] Of course!
-- Lisa wrecks the ending, "Sideshow Bob Roberts"

% The next day's headline reads "Toddlers Topple Mayor", with a
% subheading showing Abe's picture with "Expressway Halt Rankles
% Elderly".  Bob crumples the paper in disgust.

     Bob: Someday I'll have my vengeance -- someday, when I find my way
          out of this savage, roach-ridden cesspool --
           [camera pulls back to "Springfield Minimum Security Prison"]
     Man: Say, Terwilliger's a Yalie.

Coxswain: Bob!  Come along.  We need an eighth to row against the
          Princeton alums.
     Bob: Princeton?!  [groans]
Coxswain: Stroke!  Stroke!  Stroke...
