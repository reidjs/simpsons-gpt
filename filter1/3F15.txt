	Troy McClure, and the Muppets in the 1977 film: "The Muppets Go
	Medieval".
  Troy: Oh Princess Fair, wilst thou grant me thine dainty hoof in
	marriage?
 Piggy: Oh, Sir Lies-A-Lot, I will!
	 [they kiss each other]
  Troy: [purrs]
Kermit: [in armor, wielding a sword] Unhand the swine, you swain! Come,
	Piggy. back to Hamelot.
 Piggy: Heck no, frog. Me and Iron Pants are just getting acquinted.

% Troy and Kermit duel, but as Kermit grunts at the effort, it's quite
% obvious that Troy doesn't even bother to move his sword.

% Our favorite family is wathing this movie on TV.

 Lisa: Dad, what's a muppet?
Homer: Well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but
       man... [laughs] So to answer your question I don't know.
-- No deep thoughts yet, I see, "A Fish Called Selma"

 Bart: Why'd they make that one muppet out of leather?
Marge: That's not a leather muppet, that's Troy McClure. Mmm, back in
       the '70s he was quite a teen heartthrob.
Homer: Yeah, who'd have thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?
Marge: What are you talking about?
Homer: You know, his bizarre personal life. Those weird things they say
       he does down at the aquarium. Why I heard...
Marge: Oh, Homer, that's just an urban legend. People don't do that
       type of thing with _fish_!
-- He may hold you to that, "A Fish Called Selma"

Troy McClure's a perfect gentleman, like Bing Crosby or JFK.
-- Now who's being naive, Marge?, "A Fish Called Selma"

% Marge concludes: "I wonder where Troy is now."
%
% Answering her question, we get to follow a DeLorean bearing a "Follow
% me to Springfield Aquarium!" bumper sticker. Of course, the driver is
% Troy McClure, and he seems to have vision problems, as he knocks
% almost every parked car he can find. "Hey, these cars are all over the
% road!" he blames, just before a siren is heard from behind. He parks,
% and Chief Wiggum comes out of a police car.

Wiggum: All right, Captain Rush-Rush, out of the car!
	 [Troy slams the DeLorean's door in his face]
	Ow, I'm seeing stars here!
  Troy: No, just one! Hi, I'm Troy McClure; you may remember me from
	such films as "The Greatest Story Ever Hulaed", and "They Came
	to Burgle Carnegie Hall".
-- "A Fish Called Selma"

% Wiggum doesn't remember Troy from such films.

Wiggum: License please?
	 [Troy hands his license]
	Says here you need corrective lenses. Put those glasses on,
	Mister.
  Troy: You wouldn't ask a handsome man like me to wear glasses? It'd
	be a crime against nature!
	 [groans, then puts his glasses on, which are powerful
	 magnifiers]
Wiggum: [surprised] Gaa! Well, they do kinda make you look like a
	nerd... Tell you what, just go down to the DMV tomorrow, try to
	pass that eye test. I'll tear up this ticket but I'm uh...
	still gonna have to ask you for a bribe.
-- Professional as always, "A Fish Called Selma"

% The next day, at the DMV, it's still another day for Patty and Selma.

Grampa: [to Selma] Hello Marge. [to Patty] Hello Marge.
 Selma: [groans] How come no Chippendales dancers ever come in to renew
	their licenses?
 Patty: They carpool, that's the problem.
	 [stamps Grampa's license]
Grampa: Hey! I came here to get this revoked!
-- The passionate life of a DMV employee, "A Fish Called Selma"

% Troy McClure walks into the DMV, which brings murmurs from the crowd.

Hibbert: Troy McClure? I thought he disappeared after that scandal at
	 the aquarium.
  Louie: Hey, I thought you said Troy McClure was dead.
   Tony: No, what I said was: "He sleeps with the fishes". You see...
  Louie: Uh, Tony, please, no. I just ate a whole plate of
	 dingamagoo...
-- And it doesn't look pretty on the way out, "A Fish Called Selma"

% Next thing Selma knows, Troy is standing in front of her. "Whoa...
% Troy McClure!" she utters. Troy just stands there gazing at her
% beauty, until he recalls his glasses and puts them on. The shock to
% harsh reality is brutal.

 Troy: [surprised in disgust] Uh... Hello, beautiful! John Law tells me
       I might need to wear these glasses.
Selma: You? [giggle] Nonsense! You're Troy McClure! I remember you from
       such films as "Meet Joe Blow" and "Give My Remains to Broadway".
       Stars like you don't need glasses.
	[Troy smiles suggestively at Selma, who smiles back at him]
Patty: Yech!
-- That's still some improvement over Barney, "A Fish Called Selma"

Selma: Now, Mr. McClure, would you like to take off those glasses, and
       read the top line? [points to an eye chart]
 Troy: Err... W... 7... star... pound... uh...
       Look, Ms... [looks at Selma's name plate] Bouvier, as an actor I
       depend on my remarkable looks.
	[Selma smiles silently]
       If you could find in your heart to pass me, I'm sure I could
       find some way to repay you.
Selma: [gulps] Mubble.
 Troy: Say, by buying you dinner?
	[Selma smiles with joy and stamps his license several times]
 Troy: That took a lot of class.
-- His charms are still working, "A Fish Called Selma"

% That night, they're having dinner at the Pimento Grove, a very chic
% restaurant, with many pictures of celebrities as part of the decor.
% Selma seems to be having fun, but Troy is yawning of boredom.

Selma: All these celebrities on the walls; I'm just know a big star
       like you is up there somewhere.
 Troy: Uh, yes, I'm over there... [vaguely points somewhere]
Selma: [as she browses the walls] Hmm... Uh... Huh-uh. Hmm?
	[finally finds Troy's picture on the pet door]
       Oh!
-- "Cats", anyone?, "A Fish Called Selma"

 Troy: So, working at the DMV must be very interesting.
Selma: Well, uh... I think I'm getting Repetitive Stress Disorder from
       scratching my butt all day.
       [clears throat]
       Being a huge movie star must be good too. What are you working
       on now?
 Troy: I've been reading a lot of scripts lately. You know, it's a lot
       cheaper than _going_ to the movies.
-- But it's just not the same, "A Fish Called Selma"

% At the end of their not-so-enchanted evening...

   Selma: Well, thanks for holding up your end of the bargain. I had a
	  pretty good time.
    Troy: [sounding tired] Yeah, me too. You need a ride, somewhere...
Reporter: Hey, get a load of this: Troy McClure and what looks like a
	  date!

% by many people.

Lenny: Hey, Homer, isn't this your sister-in-law on a date with Troy
       McClure?
Homer: Pft... Troy McClure. He's a washed-up movie star, he could be
       dating washed-up supermodels.
Lenny: Ho, I don't know. Maybe those rumors about his fish fetish
       weren't true after all.
 Carl: Ah, this changes everything; I'd pay to see him in a movie now.

-- That's flattering, "A Fish Called Selma"

 Troy: [laughing] That's too funny! I can't remember when I've heard a
       funnier anecdote. [laughing] All right, now you tell one.
Selma: Well, not much happens to me. But I once had dinner with a movie
       star, and it was the most wonderful night of my life.
 Troy: Really? Who was it, George Segal? I hear he plays the banjo.
-- Watched him in "The Babysitter", too, "A Fish Called Selma"

% As Troy misses the point, Selma feels an urge to smoke a cigarette.
% However, she merely has the time to light one before everyone around

-- When you look at it this way..., "A Fish Called Selma"

Selma: Are you gay?
 Troy: Gay? I wish! If I were gay they'd be no problem! No, what I have

Parker: Yeah, for a role like this, you gotta pour it on. You and your,

  Troy: A baby, eh? What do I do?
Parker: I'll send you over a pamphlet. Listen, you can't buy that kind
