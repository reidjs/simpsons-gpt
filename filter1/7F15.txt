Selma: [sadly] Oh, I don't know.  [perks up]  Why?  You know somebody?
Lisa:  No.
Selma: [grunt]
Lisa:  Since I'm sure you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece,

Homer: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.  But I thought she was the one that didn't like
       to be ... you know ... touched.
Marge: It's Patty who chose a life of celibacy.  Selma simply had celibacy
