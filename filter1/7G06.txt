Lisa:  But Mr. Largo!  That's what my country's all about.
Largo: What?!?
Lisa:  I'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of a car.  The

Lisa:  OW!  Ooh, ow!  Ooh!
PE Teacher: [blows whistle]  Lisa!  We are playing dodge-ball here.

Lisa:  In other words, to dodge the ball.
PET:   Listen missy, just tell me why you weren't getting out of the way

% [End of Act One.  Time: 4:48]

Homer:  [reading the note]  Lisa refuses to play dodgeball because she is
        sad.  [end of note]  She doesn't look sad.  I don't see any tears
        in her eyes.
Lisa:   It's not that kind of sad.  I'm sorry Dad, but you wouldn't
        understand.
Homer:  Oh sure I would, Princess.  I have feeling too, you know, like
        ``My stomach hurts', or ``I'm going crazy!''
-- ``Moaning Lisa''

% She climbs up onto her father's knee.  Lisa muses, ``I'm just wondering
% what's the point.  Would it make any difference at all if I never existed?
% How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?''
% Unable to respond to these deep questions, Homer says, ``Come on Lisa, ride

% run her a hot bath like when she feels sad.

Lisa:  Sorry Dad, I know you mean well.  [kisses him]
Homer: Thanks for knowing I mean well.

Bart:  Gee Homer, it looks like you've got yourself a real problem on

Homer: Your right... Uhh... Bart!  Vacuum this floor!
Bart:  Hey Man!  I didn't do anything wrong!
Homer: In times of trouble you've got to go with what you know.  Now hop

% wearing her bathrobe.

Bart:   [sarcastically]  Enjoy your bath?
Lisa:   No, not really.
Bart:   Oh, too bad.  Well I've certainly had fun vacuuming.  Maybe now
        I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub.
Lisa:   [to Maggie] So typical of Bart.  All he thinks about is himself.
Bart:   Hey!  Don't say stuff like that about me to Maggie.  She's on my
        side anyway.
Lisa:   Is not!
Bart:   Is too!
Lisa:   Is not.
Bart:   Is too!
Lisa:   Is not.
Bart:   Is too!  Watch, I'll prove it.  Maggie, come to the one you love
        best.
Maggie: [hops off the couch, looks at Bart]
Lisa:   No Maggie!  Come here girl, come to me.
Bart:   [shaking a rattler]  Come on Maggie, the choice is obvious.
Lisa:   [beckoning her]  No Maggie, don't go for the glitter, look for
        substance.
Maggie: [looks at them both, uncertain]
Lisa:   [giving up] All right Maggie, just go to Bart.
Bart:   Egg-zactly, come to the one you love best.

Lisa:  I was just playing the blues... Dad. [sobs]
Homer: Lisa, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to yell.  Go ahead, play your
       blues if it'll make you happy.
Lisa:  No, that's okay, Dad.  I'll just work on my fingering, unless my

% Marge is still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa.

Marge:  I don't know... Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs

Lisa:   But I don't feel like smiling.
Marge:  Well it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know?  It's what
        shows up on the surface that counts.  That's what my mother

        the way down, past your knees until your almost walking on them.
        And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and
        boys will like you, and happiness will follow.
