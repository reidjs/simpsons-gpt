Skinner: [walking to his window] The year was 1968.  We were on recon in

         understand it.  But our momentary lapse of concentration

         I spent the next three years in a POW camp, forced to subsist
         on a thin stew of fish, vegetables, prawns, coconut milk, and
         four kinds of rice.  I came close to madness trying to find it
         here in the States, but they just can't get the spices right --

       your championship!
Homer: So you're saying...we're definitely going to win?  Woo hoo!
        [grabs Oscar] I won't need _this_ any more!
        [tries flushing it; tries again and again and again]
       Marge, someone broke the toilet!
-- Oscar vs. bowling trophy, "Team Homer"

% At the bowling lanes, Homer, Moe, and Apu prepare their balls.  The
% Holy Rollers walk in in monk's garb, their hoods drawn.  They lower
% their hoods and look to the heavens as light bathes them.

  Moe: Don't worry about nothing, Homer.  I have a feeling that Mr.
       Burns is going to have a little accident that might keep him from
       bowling with us tonight, heh heh heh.
Burns: [walking in, leaning on Smithers] Smithers, I'm afraid I won't be
       able to play tonight.  My old gimpy knee has gone akimbo again.
  Moe: [masked, with a cane] Take that!
        [bashes Burns on the leg with a cane, runs off]
Burns: Ooh!  Smithers...that precision assault popped it back into
       place.  Thank you, masked stranger!
-- Tonya Harding's bodyguard, he ain't, "Team Homer"

  Moe: D'oh, he's going to ruin everything!  All right, that's it,
       Homer: either Burns goes, or Moe goes.
  Apu: Yes, I am afraid that I am going to have to make a similar threat
       with my name in place of Moe's name.
Burns: So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister?
Homer: Oh, uh...Mr. Burns?  As team captain, it's my duty to inform you
       that --
Burns: Oh, I almost forgot.  I brought you all a little something.
        [pulls out a professionally-designed Pin Pals T-shirt]
  Moe: Aw, would you look at that?  "Pin Pals".
  Apu: At last, I finally have a garment fine enough to be married in.
Burns: I've always been wealthy, but this is the first time I ever
       felt...rich.
Homer: [sobs] Aw.
Burns: Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me.
Homer: [pause] You're off the team.
Burns: I -- what?
  Moe: [awkward laugh] He's just ribbing you, Monty.
        [Apu agrees; they all laugh]
-- How quickly they forget, "Team Homer"

% Mr. Burns tosses a ball weakly down the lane while Ned, Maude, Helen,
% and Timothy all bowl strikes.  "Yay!" cheers Ned.  "Hallelujah,"
% intones Timothy.  Burns' ball rolls into the gutter as his team
% groans.
%
% From behind the pins, we see them all scatter as Apu stands at the
% other end.  The nest shot shows Moe standing at the other end.  The
% next shot shows Burns standing at the other end.  He stands aside and
% says, "Nice one, Homer."  Homer thanks him.
%
% Homer rolls another strike.  Apu notes, "OK, the Holy Rollers are
% ahead by one pin and we only have one bowler left: Mr. Burns."  Mr.
% Burns walks to get a ball and his fingers flap in the wind from the
% ball return.  His team sighs as he winds up and delivers a weak ball
% that rolls straight into the gutter.  "Well, next time, a few steps
% more toward center, don't you think?" he asks jovially.  "Goodbye,
% trophy," Homer says to the gleaming trophy.
%
% Burns' second shot teeters on the edge of the gutter.  Otto, at the
% game machine, has latched onto a screw without realizing it.  "Whoa,
% whatever I got a hold of, it's _big_!"  The ball rolls on the edge and
% glances off two pins, making them wobble.  Otto, with a final grunt,
% dislodges the screw, pulling the leg of the machine and toppling it.
% The vibration causes the two pins to fall.  "Yes!" cheer Burns'
% teammates.  "Excellent," says Burns.  Otto looks down at the prizes,
% grabs the lobster harmonica, and cries, "Yes!"

Homer: Woo hoo!  We won!  We won!
        [Homer, Apu, and Moe dance while the kid gets the trophy from
       the case]
        [Homer holds it, but Burns takes it]
Burns: You mean, _I_ won.
  Apu: But we were a team, Sir.
Burns: Oh, I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart.
       You see, teamwork will only take you so far.  Then, the truly
       evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory.  Now, I
       must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll
       after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win
       the title.  Ta!
        [walks off with Smithers]
Homer: I guess some people never change.  Or, they quickly change and
       then quickly change back.
  Moe: You know what?  We don't need him, or his trophy!  We got each
       other, huh?
        [general murmurs of agreement]
-- The only ship worth a damn, "Team Homer"

% Homer's three former teammates stand outside the gates of Burns'
% compound and cheer Homer on.  "Go, Homer!  You're our man.  If you
% can't do it, no one can!"  Homer smashes a window at Burns' place and
% grabs the trophy, setting off the alarm and releasing the hounds.  He
% makes a dash for the gate, but doesn't make it over in time.  The dogs
% tear him to shreds as Otto remarks, "Well, I guess no one can."  Moe
% cries, "Run before they're through feeding!"  They do so as Homer
% continues to be torn apart.
