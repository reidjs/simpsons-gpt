Milhouse:	Oh, hi, Lisa!  Did you have a nice summer?  Don't 
		you hate that we have to go back to stupid school 
		tomorrow?
Lisa:		I like school.
Milhouse:	Me too!  We have so much in common.
Lisa:		You have a pen glued to your cowlick.

Homer:	Mmm ... Hey, this hot dog tastes different.
Apu:	Yes, I just cleaned off the machine, sir.  So the snack

Homer:	Yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog

Apu:	I'm so sorry, but I sold it all to the rendering plant.
Homer:	People buy grease?
Apu:	Oh, yes, they use it to make products such as soap,

% Alex stares in disgust for a moment, but then declares, "You are so

% hits Alex in the face with another greaseball, prompting her to
% complain, over the credits, that "There was bacon in that!"  It was
% a magical evening.
