Homer:	Wait a minute.  Is this the biggest steak you've got?  
	Seventy-two ounces?  I thought this was supposed to be a 
	steakhouse, not a little girly, underpantsy, pink doily, 
	tea-party place.

	request.  We call it, uh, Sir Loin-A-Lot.  It's, uh, the

Homer:	Ooh, I'll have that one.  And to drink ... meatballs.

Red:	Red Barclay's my name.  I'm a trucker, and I've eaten

Lisa:	Wow, Dad and Bart have been everywhere!  They've eaten 
	submarine sandwiches, grinders, *and* hoagies.
Marge:	It's not fair.  Your father always gets to have such

% For Marge, the path to the wild side leads to a doorbell shop.  She 
% hopes to get a spiffy musical doorbell, but is immediately 
% overwhelmed by the store's vast selection.  Gil, now a trainee 
% doorbell salesman, is overwhelmed by Nelson, who leave a flaming bag 
% by one of the store's demonstration doors.  Marge tells Gil that 
% she's looking for a particular tune, and tries her best to warble 
% it.  Within seconds, Lisa has found the exact doorbell her mother is 
% looking for; one that plays the Carpenters' "Close to You."  Gil 
% frets over this sudden competition in the doorbell-sales arena.
%
% On the road again, Homer and Bart dine at a truck stop.

Homer:	Sure thing ... [reads her nametag] Gwen.
Gwen:	I'll be right back with your pie, hon.
Homer:	Ah, there's a nice friendly gal.
Bart:	Yeah.
Homer:	Wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop,

Bart:	I suppose.
Homer:	Great!  I'll write your mother and tell her the marriage

Gwen:	Will that be all, sweetie?
Homer:	For now.

	Damn it!  Ring the bell!
D. Man:	Why?  You already know I'm here, dontcha?

% Finally, Lisa breaks and rings the bell.  Marge is enraptured by the 
% tune, and tries to sing along.  ("Why do birds suddenly appear, over 
% here ... over there.")  Lisa notices the song keeps playing over 
% again, but Marge doesn't seem to mind.
%
% At the drive-in, Homer and Bart watch a movie from the front row.  
% Unfortunately, that means their truck blocks the view of everyone in 
% the second and higher rows.  The people in those cars are missing 
% "The Monster That Ate Everybody," which includes a scene where a 
% clueless starlet doesn't quite get what "It ate everybody" means.
%
% Later, Homer and Bart fish, without bait, from a quiet bridge.  Bart 
% reminds Homer that Red's shipment has to arrive in ten hours, and 
% they're 2,200 miles from their destination.  It's time to put the

% Homer runs into an all-night country market.

Clerk:	Hey, you can't take that many pep pills at once.

% slows down, steering itself as it travels the precarious road.  
% Finally, the truck rolls safely into a fuel station.

% Homer snaps awake and realizes that while he crashed, the truck 
% didn't.  He gets out of the cab, and approaches some other truckers.

Homer:		You'll never believe what just happened.  I fell 
		asleep at the wheel, and the truck drove here by 
		itself.
Trucker 3:	Yeah, that Navitron Autodrive system's made our jobs

Homer:		Eh, I'm not really a trucker, so I don't talk to the
