Krusty: What have you been doing with yourself, Bob?
   Bob: Well, Krusty, as you may remember, after I tried to frame you 
	for armed robbery, I tried to murder Selma Bouvier.  Let's 
	see...I rigged the mayoral elections, I tried to blow up 
	Springfield with a nuclear device, and I tried to kill you.
Krusty: Oh, yeah.
   Bob: And, whenever I could find a spare moment, I've tried to murder 
	Bart Simpson.
-- Thank you, exposition boy!  "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bart panics, running up to his bedroom.  Marge thinks that someone

Marge: We're _very_ proud of you, by the way.

Marge: But, he's safely locked away.

% Cecil suggests they make a fresh start, with Bob coming to work for

  Bob: Touche, Cecil.
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Despite everything, Cecil is willing to hire him out of fraternal

% Bob and Cecil embrace.  Shortly afterwards, Bob is released, as a mob

% quiet them.  Then, Bob himself makes a heartfelt appeal.

   Bob: Isn't our system of justice based on the idea that a man can

% appointed apartment.  He offers his brother a glass of Bordeaux.

Cecil: I have the '82 Chateau Latour and a rather indifferent Rausan-

  Bob: I've been in prison, Cecil.  I'll be happy just as long it 
       doesn't taste like orange drink fermented under a radiator.
Cecil: That would be the Latour, then.

% Homer and Marge watch on as Bart says his prayers.

Marge: Bart, no!
 Bart: It's him or me, O Lord.  [Marge struggles to unclasp Bart's

Marge: You can't ask God to kill someone.
Homer: Yeah.  You do your own dirty work.
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Later, Cecil and Bob dine together.

  Bob: Well, I suppose I should ask you what you do if I'm to be 
       working with you.
Cecil: _For_ me, Bob.  _For_ me.  I am Springfield's chief hydrological 
       and hydrodynamical engineer.
  Bob: Hydrological and hydrodynamical?  Talk about running the gamut.
Cecil: Snigger all you like, Bob.
  Bob: Thank you.  I believe I shall.
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Cecil opines that one gets more respect as a civil servant than as a 
% homicidal maniac.  "Or a clown's sidekick."  Bob believes this 
% confirms his theory: Cecil still resents the fact that Krusty chose 
% Bob, not him, as his sidekick years before.

  Bob: You wanted to be Krusty's sidekick since you were five!  What 
       about the buffoon lessons, the four years at clown college.
Cecil: I'll thank you not to refer to Princeton that way.

% so many years ago.
%
% Flashback to ten years before.  Cecil is in full clown regalia, while

 Cecil: [clears throat] [meekly] Hey, children.  Meet me, Sideshow 
	Cecil.
Krusty: [makes buzzer noise] Next!
 Cecil: Uh, I have prepared a pie-in-the-face take.
Krusty: [groans] All right, knock yourself out, kid.  Hal?
 Cecil: [the pie plasters him] Ooh.  [he grins half-heartedly]
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Krusty tells him that the pie gag is only funny if "the sap's got

% and his hair springs up with a boinging sound.  Bob: "Oh dear."  
% Everyone laughs, and gradually, Bob smiles at the recognition he's 
% receiving.

That guy's a genius!  He's gonna change the way we think about getting 
hit by pies.
-- Krusty on Sideshow Bob, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Krusty hires Bob on the spot.
%
% Back to the present.

Cecil: When that pie hit your face, I saw my dreams explode in a burst 
       of cream and crust.  But I suppose I should thank you.  After 
       all, it lead me to my true calling.
  Bob: Cecil, no civilization in history has ever considered chief 
       hydrological engineer a calling.
        [Cecil clears his throat meaningfully]
       Yes, yes, the Cappadocians, fine.
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% To the Springfield River.  Bob and Cecil walk to an overlook.

Cecil: There it is, the future site of the Springfield hydroelectric 
       dam.
  Bob: Just the thought of all that raw power makes me wonder why the 
       hell I should care.
Cecil: Because _you'll_ be supervising the construction crew.
  Bob: Oh, great.  I supposed that when a woman passes by, it will be 
       my job to lead in the hooting.  `Oh, yeah!  Shake it, madam.  
       Capital knockers!'
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Cecil tries to sell him on the idea: it's Bob's big chance to redeem 
% himself in the eyes of Springfield.
%
% Meanwhile, we see that the Terwilliger brothers are being spied upon 
% from across the river by Bart and Milhouse.

    Bart: He's planning something evil, I know it.  It must have 
	  something to do with the town's water supply.
Milhouse: Maybe he's gonna pee in the river!
    Bart: Mmm, nah, that's not his style.
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bob spies the two boys hiding in the bushes.

  Bob: Who is that?  Why, it's Bart Simpson!
       [calling] Hello, Bart!  
        [Bart ducks]
       He's just a little shy because I've tried to kill him so many times.
Cecil: Ah.
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% At "The Pimento Grove", Bob dines with Ms. Krabappel.

Edna: It's so exciting to be dating a killer.
 Bob: To be fair, I never successfully killed anyone.
Edna: [disappointed] Oh, I see.
       [at another table, we see Bart spying on the pair]
 Bob: I did once try to kill the world's greatest lover, [slyly] but 
      then I realized that there are laws against suicide.  [Edna 
      chuckles playfully] You get my drift?
       [they move towards each other, ready to kiss]
Bart: Mrs. Krabappel, no!  That's Sideshow Bob!
Edna: Ah, well that's the last time I announce my dinner plans in 
      class.  [leaves angrily]
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bob angrily berates Bart for breaking up his date with the great Edna 
% K., but Bart is far from apologetic.

   Bob: _That_ was Edna Krabappel.  You only get one chance with Edna 
	Krabappel, I hope you're happy.
  Bart: I won't be happy until I find out what you're up to.  Wherever 
	you go and whatever you do, I'll be there watching and waiting.
Wiggum: He says that, but I bet he gives up pretty quickly.
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Some time later, the dam construction is well underway.  Cecil enters 
% a trailer where Bob is examining some blueprints.

 Cecil: Hello, brother.  All's well, I trust?
   Bob: It most certainly is _not_.  The workmen you've given me don't 
	know their asses from the hole in the ground they blew up 
	yesterday.
 Cecil: Come now, you speak as if they were nothing but a gaggle of 
	slack-jawed yokels.
Cletus: Mister Terwillidjer, come quick.  There's trouble down to the 
	See-Ment mixer, sir!
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

Cletus: See, cousin Merl and me, we were playing with Geech.  That's

         [said dog has become one big cement dog statue]
  Merl: Geech gone to heaven, Mister Terwillidjer.
   Bob: Oh, cousin Merl, really!
 Cecil: Temper, temper.  You know cousin Merl `ain't been quite right' 
	lately.
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bob is irritated to the point of distraction, both at his rustic 
% workers and at Bart, who is constantly spying on him (he reveals Bart 
% hiding in a pipe).  "Sometimes I wish this dam would burst and bury 
% this cursed town", he says ominously.
%
% That evening, Bart and Lisa walk along a street in downtown 
% Springfield.  As they pass by a dumpster (whoops, I mean "Trash-co 
% Waste Disposal Unit[tm]"), Bart jumps in an rummages around.

Lisa: Hey, you said we were going to Dairy Queen.
Bart: I lied.  Now help me rummage through Bob's trash for clues.  Then 
      I promise we'll go to the waterslide.
Lisa: Okay.  [she hops in]
-- Gullible Lisa, "The Brother From Another Series"

% While they dig around, Sideshow Bob happens upon them.  They scream.

  Bob: [Angrily] You again!  Well, that's it.  [ominously] I'm going to

        [at the Simpson home, there is a knock at the door.  Marge opens
        it to reveal Bob].

Homer: Lisa too?
  Bob: _Especially_ Lisa.  But, _especially_ Bart.
-- Isn't that especial?  "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bob warns (need I say, warns ominously?) that if they cross him one 
% more time, he won't be responsible for his actions.

Well, I hope Bob fed you, cause I ate your dinners.
-- Homer the caregiver, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Lisa tells Bart that, though it is hard for him to accept, Bob really 
% has changed.  Bart refuses to believe this however.

      There's only one place where it could possibly be.
Lisa: Bob's trailer at the construction site?
Bart: [pause] That's even better!  Let's go there.  [both walk off]
Lisa: What were you thinking?
Bart: The haunted mine.
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% That evening, the two children climb into an open window in the 
% trailer and look around.  Bart finds blueprints, invoices, schedules.  
% Lisa notes, sarcastically, "If I didn't know better, I'd swear Bob 
% was building a dam."  Then, Bart finds a briefcase stuffed with cash.  
% Just at that moment, they hear Bob trying to get in.  When the door 
% won't open, he breaks through the glass.  Bart and Lisa scream.
%
% [End of Act II.]
%
% Bob looks suspiciously around his trailer.

 Bob: Who left the lights on.  Who's in here?  Cletus?  Cousin Merl?  
      Big Hungry Joe?  [behind the watercooler, he sees Bart's 
      distinctive hairline]
Bart: [muffled] I think he may have spotted us.
-- No kidding, "The Brother From Another Series"

% They run out of the trailer, and into the bowels of the dam.

Be careful!  There's hydroelectricity in there!
-- Sideshow Bob, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bob chases the children through an Escheresque maze of stairways and 
% catwalks.
%
% Finally, he confronts them in a large room filled with turbines.  He 
% begs them to stop tormenting him, claiming he's done nothing wrong.  
% Bart, however, reveals the briefcase they found.  Bob seems to be 
% shocked at the discovery.

 Bob: I've never seen that money before in my life!
Lisa: Then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it.
-- Lisa's specious reasoning, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bob still maintains his innocence.  He points to the dam as evidence 
% of his recent activities.  When he pounds on the wall for emphasis, 
% however, it collapses to reveal that the dam is hollow.  Then the 
% money must have come from cutbacks in building materials.  But if Bob 
% isn't guilty, then who is?
%
% Cecil, of course.  He reveals that he's going to blow up the dam, 
% destroying all evidence, and letting the soon-to-be-dead Bob take the 
% blame.

Cecil: I'm framing you and I'm doing a really excellent job, too.
  Bob: Wait a minute.  This is all because I got to be Krusty's 
       sidekick instead of you, isn't it?
Cecil: Off the record, yes.  But officially, I did it for the money!
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% "Speaking of which, hand it over."  Bart does so, at gunpoint.  Cecil 
% backs out of the room, and closes the door.  Suddenly the door opens 
% and he pops his head back in.

Cecil: I forgot to mention, I'm planning to blow up the dam with you 
       inside.
  Bob: Well, obviously.
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% The door slams shut and is audibly locked.

Lisa: Oh, it's hopeless, utterly, utterly hopeless.
 Bob: Oh, I see.  When it's one of _my_ evil schemes, you can't foil it 
      fast enough, but when _Cecil_ tries to kill you, it's [imitating 
      her] hopeless, utterly, utterly hopeless.
-- Fraternal resentment, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bob decides he's going to have to foil Cecil himself.
%
% To escape from the room, he blocks a turbine and prepares to dive 
% through with Lisa.  Bart is reluctant to join them, however.

 Bob: Bart, for once, I'm not trying to kill you.  I know it's an 
      awkward situation, and I don't like it any more than you do, but 
      you've got to trust me.
Bart: Ah, what the hell.
-- That's the spirit, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Their dive through the pipes is brief but spectacular.  They climb

Cecil: At last I'm going to do what Bob never could.  Kill Bart 
       Simpson!
 Bart: Throwing me off a dam?  Isn't that a little crude for a genius
