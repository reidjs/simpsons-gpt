% At the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham, Howe, and Weissman, an executor
% and the Simpsons are seated.

Executor: May I offer my condolences on the untimely passing of your
          Great Aunt Hortense.  As her only living heirs, you stand to
          inherit her entire estate.
   Homer: [crying] Poor Aunt Hortense! [crying]
           [weakly] Woo-hoo.
          [crying] [weakly] Woo-hoo.
Executor: The only stipulation is that you spend one night in a haunted
          house.
   Marge: Isn't that somewhat unusual?
Executor: No, it's a standard clause.
-- Section 2, Paragraph 3, Clause 5, "Bart the Fink"

% But Homer isn't worried, because there's no such thing as ghosts.
% The family drives up to a particularly large and scary-looking house
% right out of Psycho, in a lightning storm at that.  But Homer is
% still confident: "Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts."  All seems
% lost, but then a sweet, blissful morning comes around.

   Homer: Best night's sleep I ever had.
    Lisa: Their tap water tasted better than ours.
-- The Simpsons spend the night in a haunted house, "Bart the Fink"

% The executor gives them each $100 (except Maggie), and the rest goes
% to Ann Landers, as was stipulated in Hortense's will.  The family
% look puzzled, and the executor realizes he must have kept on talking
% after OFF left, and walks away laughing maniacally.

% The family drive away from the "haunted" house.

Marge: What are you gonna spend your money on, kids?
 Bart: There's a special down at the Tacomat: a hundred tacos for a
       hundred dollars.  I'm gonna get that.
 Lisa: I'm going to contribute _my_ money to the Corporation for
       Public Broadcasting.
Marge: Tacos?  Public broadcasting?
-- Regretting your $30 contributon, eh?, "Bart the Fink"

% Marge wants the kids to put their money in the bank.  When they get
% there, Bart spots the Tacomat and wishes he could get those hundred
% tacos.  The comic book guy comes out with a wheelbarrow full of tacos
% for the "Dr. Who" marathon.

% At the bank...

Marge: You'll feel better knowing your money's in the hands of
       professionals.
Clerk: [in an ape mask] Uk, uk, are you folks ready to go ape?
 Lisa: Mom...
Marge: A professional in an ape mask is still a professional.
-- At the First Tarzan Bank (of Springfield), "Bart the Fink"

% Bart talks to the man in charge of new accounts.

 Man: ... and you'll find that saving for your future is far more
      thrilling than any roller coaster.
Bart: Really?  Wow, I should have started a long time ago!
 Man: Mm-hmm.  Now sign these forms.  I'm sure you'll find them more
      interesting than a weekend with Batman.
-- Batbart signs Batforms, "Bart the Fink"

% Later, in the car, Lisa tells Bart she got the new Thrifty Savers
% Savings Account.  A year from now, she'll have an extra nickel.  Bart
% got a checking account with free customized checks, choosing the "Oh
% the Humanity" check design.  Marge worries that Bart will not be able
% to handle it, but he thinks he can.  Then he gives Lisa a check for
% one cent.

% At school...

Milhouse: A million dollars?  Gee, thanks Bart, I owe you one.
    Bart: That's a postdated check, remember.  Don't cash it 'til; the
          year 10,000
Milhouse: Okay.
           [checks his watch]
-- By then you might _be_ an ape, "Bart the Fink"

% Bart gives Jimbo a check for a dollar, since Jimbo's holding him
% upside down.  Jimbo promises to let Bart go when the check clears,
% and drags him along the ground.

% Bart wants to get Krusty's autograph, but...

That's it, no more autographs.  They're naming a burger after me at the
new restaurant.
-- Krusty, "Bart the Fink"

% Milhouse got Krusty's autograph on his chest, and offers to press
% bellies before the ink dries.  But Bart has a better idea: slips a
% quarter's worth check into Krusty's pocket.  "If he wants this
% twenty-five cents, he'll have to endorse the check by signing his
% name on the back.  Then, when I get my monthly bank statement, I'll
% get the check back complete with autograph.  No fuss, no muss..."
% Milhouse thinks it's a good plan, but it won't impress girls.  He
% demonstrates by baring his belly to a bunch of girls, who are
% revolted.  Milhouse then laughs like an idiot.

% A month later, Bart gets Lisa's signature, Apu's (?), and Jimbo's
% (whose real name is Corky).  But Krusty's stamped his check with
% a Cayman Islands Off-Shore Holding Corporation stamp.  Bart is
% enraged, and takes it back to the bank so that they can make him sign
% it.  The clerk assures Bart that's it's perfectly legal, but there
% seemed to be a tipoff (can anything be more suspicious than the
% Caymans?) and, in the course of five minutes, Krusty gets arrested
% for tax fraud.  

                     [on phone]
Cayman Islands guy: [laughs] I'm sorry, but I cannot divulge
                    information about that customer's secret illegal
                    account.
                     [hangs up]
                    Oh, crap.  I shouldn't have said he was a customer.
                    Oh, crap.  I shouldn't have said it was a secret.
                    Oh, crap!  I certainly shouldn't have said it was
                    illegal.
                     [sighs] It's too hot today.
-- Who cares?, "Bart the Fink"

% But it takes until 5:00 for Bart to find out:

Clerk: Sorry, the bank is-- oh, kid.  Gosh, I'm sorry, I meant to
       tell you -- turns out Krusty is one of the biggest tax cheats in
       history, and they nailed him, all thanks to you.  Some might say
       you're a hero, kid.
       Not me, however, I love Krusty.
 Bart: Ohh...

% [End of Act One.  Time: 5'36"]

% Kent Brockman reports about Krusty's tax "avoision" (with a little
% argument with his staff) and mentions that it would have never come
% to light if it weren't for Bart.

Bart: Krusty's my hero.  How could I do this to him?
Lisa: It's a tragedy for all us kids, but Bart, you can't beat yourself
      up.
Bart: Yeah.  There'll be plenty of people to do that for me at recess
      tomorrow.
-- Krusty's tax avoision comes to light, "Bart the Fink"

% At the IRS Plaza...

Krusty: I can't go to jail!!  I got a swanky lifestyle.  I'm used to
        the best.
 Man 1: Krusty, this is America.  We don't send our celebrities to
        jail.  We're just going to garnish your salary.
Krusty: You're going to GARNISH my CELERY?
 Man 1: Please, Krusty, no jokes!
Krusty: WHO'S JOKING?!  Oh, I don't understand what you're saying,
        it all sounds so crazy to me.
-- Boo yourself, "Bart the Fink"

 Man 2: It simply means we'll be taking a small portion of your salary
        until your debt is repaid.  Say, 75% for 40 years.
Krusty: But I don't plan to live that long.
 Man 1: All right.  Better make it 95%.
Krusty: Ah!  Oh!  Oy...
-- I may or may not die young, "Bart the Fink"

% The IRS present Krusty's new clown-related entertainment show, with
% no sets, props, costumes, or Sideshow Mel.  It's pretty much a
% disaster.

% Krusty Burger is now IRS Burger, and Homer orders lunch...

Homer: Lesse, I'll have four tax burgers, one IRS-wich, withhold the
       lettuce, four dependent-sized sodas, and a FICA-ccino.
  Kid: Fill out schedule B.  You should receive your burgers in six
       to eight weeks.
-- At the new IRS Burger, "Bart the Fink"

% Homer does a little math and works in Marge's $700 gambling losses.
% Krusty laments his fate after getting off a bus...

They took my money.  They wrecked my show, they buried a bunch of
stinking veterans in my family plot.  But at least I got my memories.
Those are locked up safe in my fabulous mansion.
-- Krusty, "Bart the Fink"

% But his mansion is being foreclosed, for cheap prices.  Krusty loses
% a handmade leather suitcase (to Patty and Selma)...

My Grandpa Zev would turn over in his grave if it wasn't filled with
some veteran.
-- Krusty when his mansion is foreclosed, "Bart the Fink"

% ... his pornography (to a bidder in Japan, beating out Jasper)...

    Krusty: Oh, my beloved pornography!  I can't watch this anymore.
            I'm going to bed.
Auctioneer: How much for Krusty's bed?
       Moe: Half a buck.
Auctioneer: Sold!
       Moe: Good night everybody!
 Everybody: Good night Moe!
-- Krusty's mansion is foreclosed, "Bart the Fink"

% ... and his private plane, I'm-on-a-rolla-Gay.

Krusty: But I love that plane!  I used to fly to Vegas in it with
        Dean Martin.  One time we were flyin' in it, and the moon hit
        his eye like a big pizza pie!  We wrote a song about it!
        But it ended up infringing on one he recorded years before.
-- That's Enole'?, "Bart the Fink"

Patty: Hey, Selma.  That plane would go great with your suitcase.
Selma: Nah.  I just bought it to soak my feet in.

-- Krusty's mansion is foreclosed, "Bart the Fink"

% The auction is complete, and Krusty sits by the curb.  Bart comes
% by and asks if he can sit down.

  Bart: I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you, Krusty, but you
        know, my mom says God never closes a door without opening a
        window.
Krusty: No offense, kid, but your mom's a dingbat!  There's no silver
        lining here.  I was a big cheese.  A _huge_ cheese!  And now
        look at me!
        I got to ride the bus like a schnook.
        I got to live in an apartment like an idiot!
        I have to wait in line with a bunch of nobodies to buy
        groceries from a failure!
  Bart: It doesn't matter what you did wrong, though, as long as you're
        on TV people will respect you.
Krusty: [spits] Bah.  What good is respect without the moolah to back
        it up.  Everywhere I go I see teachers driving Ferraris,
        research scientists drinking champagne.
        I tried to drink a Coke on the bus, and they took away my

-- Ask Willie Nelson or Leona Helmsley, "Bart the Fink"

% At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu and Sanjay come out to some buzzing noise.

Shiva H. Vishnu!
-- Apu's expletive, "Bart the Fink"

% They see Krusty bawling like a baby in his plane, waving goodbye.
% Chalmers and Mrs. Skinner walk up to a house.

          That'll do nicely.
-- "Bart the Fink"

% The Simpsons come out of hiding to watch Krusty.

 Lisa: You gotta hand it to Krusty.  
Homer: Yeah.  Even with all his problems, he's still willing to do
       something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans.
  All: Wow.
 Bart: Yeah, that's my Krusty.  I got a feeling he'll be all right.
        [Krusty crashes into a mountain]
-- I said ha-ha, "Bart the Fink"

% Everyone stands around the site of the crash, where Krusty's shoes

Ladies and gentlemen... Krusty the Clown... is dead.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 12'11"]

% The Simpsons, among many other celebrity guests, have come to the
% funeral.

 Bart: I can't believe Krusty is really gone.
Homer: Don't worry, son.  I'm sure he's in heaven right now laughing it

        [sighs]
       I wish I were dead.
-- Give me your money, your baseball, and your life, "Bart the Fink"

We are gathered here today to mourn the passing of Herschel Shmoikel
Krustofsky, beloved entertainer and dear friend... [perking up]
Hi, I'm Troy McClure!  You may remember me from other show business

% Sideshow Mel unveils a simple memorial to Krusty.  Troy introduces
% Bob Newhart, who mutters his way through a speech.  Homer sheds
% a tear.

Well, that's the funeral, folks.  We'll be sitting shivah at the

10:00.  It gets a little blue.

% Bart watches the news at home where Kent Brockman reports on the
% unveiling of the new Krusty stamp, where people were asked to vote
% on two different signs: one of his heartwarming smile, or of his
% fiery death.  They picked the first one.

% Bart repeatedly pulls a string on a Krusty doll, which nets him

Homer: Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy.  People die all the

       tomorrow.
        [pause]
       Well, goodnight.
-- Aw, I messed up again, "Bart the Fink"

% Bart, while walking, spots a pickup truck carrying nets, and someone
% with a similar appearence to Krusty.  He runs home and talks to
% Marge.

 Bart: Mom, I just saw Krusty!
Marge: Yes, dear, in your mind.
 Bart: No, on the street.
Marge: On the street in your mind.
 Bart: Why won't you believe me?
Marge: Sweetheart, sometimes when people die, you just want them to
       be alive so badly you see them everywhere.  I went through the
       same thing when Lyndon Johnson died.
-- Who the hell is Lyndon Johnson?, "Bart the Fink"

% At the hospital, Bart sees the same man walk out of Dr. Hibbert's
% office, with prescribed pills for queasiness.

      Bart: Dr. Hibbert, who was that man?
   Hibbert: [chuckles] Why, Bart, telling you that would violate the
            patient-doctor privilege, just as if I were to tell you
            that Jasper here has five seconds to live.
    Jasper: What did he say?
Mrs. Glick: He said I'm next!
-- Jasper Moleman?, "Bart the Fink"

% Bart spots the same man scuba diving for lobsters.  He talks to Lisa
% about it.

Lisa: Bart, you're seeing Krusty everywhere because you want to tell
      him you're sorry for causing his death.  Would it help if I told
      you you're not responsible for Krusty's death.
Bart: Yes.  Yes, it would.
Lisa: Well, I can't.  You'll just have to learn to live with your
      mental problem.
-- Heartless Lisa, "Bart the Fink"

% Bart, however, deduces that if he saw Krusty carrying nets, motion
% sickness pills, and scuba diving, it can only lead to one thing.
% He and Lisa head for the docks.

McAllister: Arr, I've got some customers.  Call me back, Ishmael.
-- "Bart the Fink"

% Bart blows up a balloon of Krusty and asks "Have you seen this man?"
% McAllister recognizes it as Handsome Pete who dances for nickels.
% A short guy with a Krusty-like face comes in and plays "Sailor's
% Hornpipe".  But Lisa says, "No, we're looking for this man: Krusty
% the Klown."  "Narr, narr, narr," McAllister responds.

It's no use, Bart.  We've looked up and down these docks, from Pier One
to that Pier One by Pier 17.
-- Lisa, on the search for Krusty, "Bart the Fink"

% But Bart spots something: a bounced check from a man with the exact
% same signature as Krusty, Rory B. Bellows, slip eight.  Bart gives
% Handsome Pete a quarter.  McAllister responds "Arr, not a quarter!
% He'll be dancin' for hours."  Bart and Lisa run to slip eight.

Lisa: Are you Rory B. Bellows?
Rory: Yes.
Bart: How about Krusty the Klown?
Rory: Sorry, I don't do impressions.
Bart: Well, if you're not Krusty, how come you have the exact same
      signature as him?
Rory: I'm Rory Bellows, I tell you!  And I got some real corroborating
      evidence, over here, by the throttle!
       [turns the ship up to full throttle and tries to get away,

      You know, you kids coulda said something instead of letting me
      make an ass of myself.
-- You don't need _us_ to do that, "Bart the Fink"

% Rory has a pacemaker scar and a third nipple just like Krusty.  He
% says he is Krusty, but he doesn't want to be anymore, and that's

Bart: Well, now that we've blown your cover, I guess you gotta come
      back and do your show again!
Lisa: Or kill us...
       [they both nervously giggle]
-- Way to go Lise, "Bart the Fink"

Krusty: I won't be coming back, kids.  I got a sweet life here.  The
        sea air is cleaning my lungs.  The sun is toasting my pale skin
        a healthy brown, and most important, I learned that I don't
        need money to be happy.  All that high living just distracted
        me from my true calling in life: salvaging sunken barges for
        scrap iron.  Sorry, kids, there's nothing left for me on dry
        land anymore.
  Bart: But, Krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you to
        brighten up their afternoon.  Are you gonna turn your back on
        them?
Krusty: Yes!
-- Good answer, "Bart the Fink"

% Krusty sails off, but Bart and Lisa follow him, saying a bunch of

         [Krusty throws down his anchor]
Krusty: Yeah!  I'm not gonna let those guys hog all the respect while
