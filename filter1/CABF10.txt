% It's time for "Me Wantee!" a show that, while it looks like "Who
% Wants to be a Millionaire?", is actually an original creation, like
% Rickey Rouse, or Monald Muck.  In the hot seat tonight is Moe
% Szyslak.

Virgil:	All right, Moe Szyslak!
Moe:	Yes, Virgil?
Virgil:	Yesterday, we asked if you wanted to risk it all for 
	500,000 dollars, and you stalled for twenty minutes.
Moe:	Yes, yes, I did.  I was told to.
Virgil:	Hey, that's great.  But now, we must have your answer in 
	the next ten or fifteen minutes.
	[a pretty model brings in a wheelbarrow full of cash]
	You want some of this?  [grabs some cash, and rubs it 
	against himself] Well, do ya?
Moe:	[calmly] I can honestly say I do.
Virgil:	All right, then.  For half a million dollars, which of the 
	following is not a subatomic particle?
Moe:	Oy.
Virgil:	[the answers appear on the screen as Virgil reads them]
	A) Proton
	B) Neutron
	C) Bonbon, or
	D) Electron
Moe:	Oh, boy.  All right, let's see here, uh ... well, I was 
	born in Indiana, so that ain't it.  And, uh, hmmm ... I'd 
	better call my lifeline.

% Cut to the Simpsons' living room.  The phone rings, and Homer picks
% it up.

Homer:	Hello? ... Hey, Moe!  We're watching you on TV.
Moe:	Yeah, I know, Homer.
Homer:	So, how's that bowel obstruction doing?
Moe:	Homer, please, heh-heh ... I got a nuclear-type question 
	here.
Homer:	Well, it all starts when a nulicule comes out of its nest.
Lisa:	[taking the phone] The answer is "bonbon!"
Moe:	Uh, I'm going to say, "bonbon."
Virgil:	Bonbon, eh, Moe?  Is that your ultimate response?
Moe:	Yuh-huh.
Virgil:	Oh, you are ... correct!
-- Moe the half-millionaire, "Day of the Jackanapes"

% Virgil asks if Moe wants to try for the big million-dollar prize, or
% take the $500,000 he now has.  A second wheelbarrow of cash descends
% slowly from the ceiling, and rests next to the original $500,000. 
% Somewhat uncharacteristically, Moe decides to play it safe and take
% the money.  The model lights the second wheelbarrow on fire to
% symbolize Moe's decision.  The audience cheers.
%
% There's no cheering at Krusty's studio, however.  He's meeting with
% some network executives about ways to spice up his show.

Krusty:		Eh, this quiz show crap is just a fad.
Executive:	Well, fad or not, it's here to stay.
Lindsey:	And it's killing your show in the ratings.
Krusty:		Hey, what do you want from me?  I do a kids' show.
Lindsey:	And it's a classic.  We just want you to open it up.
Executive:	Run wild.  Shatter the boundaries.  Slash and burn!
Lindsey:	Without alienating anyone.
-- Want robots and magic powers, too? "Day of the Jackanapes"

% Krusty can't believe what he's hearing.  Even Mr. Teeny, the trained
% monkey, is disgusted.  Krusty runs screaming from the room, and exit
% that doesn't impress the executives very much.
%
% Krusty recovers his composure well enough to do his show.  After
% Mme. Mimi and her cheese-seeking poodles finish their act, Krusty
% announces that next sketch is set in the "craziest" place -- a
% restaurant.  Even on the set, the network execs continue to harangue
% Krusty.  They suggest that instead of a restaurant, the skit be set
% in Seinfeld's diner.  With only five seconds to air, Krusty quickly
% rejects the idea and takes his place on the set.
%
% The sketch begins, in a set built to resemble a small Italian
% restaurant.

Krusty:		Ah, nothing like a meal in a fine restaurant.  Ah, 
		here comes the waitress.
		[a waitress walks to Krusty's table.  But this 
		"waitress" is really Lindsey Neagle]
Lindsey:	[aside to Krusty] We're losing male teens.  Can you 
		get jiggy with something?
Krusty:		You're giving me notes while I'm on the air?  That 
		tears it!  [to audience] Folks, I've been in show 
		biz for 61 years, but now these jerks have sucked 
		all the fun out.  I don't need twelve suits telling 
		me which way to pee.
Exec:		Uh, for "pee," could you substitute, "whiz?"
Lindsey:	Ah, I don't know; that could upset the Cheez Whiz(tm) 
		people.
Exec:		I was just thinking that.
Krusty:		I can't take it any more!  Folks, don't miss this 
		Friday's show -- it'll be my last.
		[audience gasps]
Exec:		Quitting show biz.  Uh, yeah, I like the area, but 
		where does it go?
Krusty:		Get away from me!  [runs off the set]
Exec:		Wait!  [chases him]
Lindsey:	We have more notes!
-- Just trying to help, "Day of the Jackanapes"

% Krusty drives away in a golf cart, but the executive hangs on to the
% back edge of the vehicle.  As the cart drags him along, Krusty bangs
% on the executive's hands with one of his clown shoes, hoping to
% loosen the exec's grip.  Eventually, he succeeds in dislodging him.

You can kill me, but two more will take my place!
-- Network Executive, "Day of the Jackanapes"

% That night, the family ponders a world without Krusty.  Lisa,
% perhaps forgetting the meaning of the word, calls it "tragic." 
% Homer imagines himself, Bart, and Lisa watching the new "Nutsy the
% Clown" show.

Marge:		Well, I think it's a good thing for a show to go off 
		the air before it becomes stale and repetitive.
		[Smithers opens the front door]
Smithers:	Maggie shot Mr. Burns again!
		[no reaction from the family.  Crickets chirp.  
		Homer coughs]

% The local news covers Krusty's exit from show biz.  A circle of
% children has gathered in front of Krustylu Studios, crying.  Chief
% Wiggum disperses them with "timeout gas."  He also tries to play
% that contest where viewers guess what city the weather lady's in
% ("Pittsburgh?"), but he's eight years too late.
%
% Kent switches to his interview of Krusty.

Kent:	I spoke to Krusty about his legacy of laughter.
	[cut to the interview.  Krusty and Kent sit in lounge 
	chairs by a fireplace]
Krusty:	Kent, the young people today, they think comedy is dirty 
	words.  It's not -- it's words that *sound* dirty, like 
	"mukluk."  [Kent and Krusty share a laugh] Mukluk.
	[cut to Bob's cell in Springfield Penitentiary.  A small 
	TV shows the interview, while Bob reads a magazine]
	You like that?  No charge.  Mukluk.  [laughs] Mukluk ...
Bob:	Oh, can it, you tiresome tot-sitter.  I was the risible 
	one in our dyad.
Kent:	Ever watch the old episodes?
Krusty:	Oh, Kent, that's a sad story.  I taped over all my old 
	episodes.  Ah, you know, I had a thing for Judge Judy, and 
	blank tape was 3.99.  What would you do?
Bob:	[gasps] Those are my shows.
Krusty:	Frankly, Kent, those episodes were no big loss.  The show 
	didn't really get funny until we fired Sideshow Bob and 
	hired whose-its.
Bob:	You've erased my past!  Now, I'll erase your future.
	[a guard bangs on Bob's cell with a nightstick]
Guard:	Hey, hey!  Lights out.
Bob:	Oh, honestly!  At Chino, they get to stay up 'til nine.
Guard:	Now, Bob, I've talked to the warden at Chino and that's 
	just not true.
Bob:	[grumbles]
-- "Day of the Jackanapes"

% Fortunately for Bob, it's time for his parole hearing.  He complains
% about the inhumane conditions at the prison, such as the too-small
% shower sandals, and the book club that takes its name too literally. 
% (He doesn't mention the early curfew, though.)  Judge Snyder takes
% pity on him, and orders Bob's release.
%
% Bob, now in civilian clothes, leaves the prison.

Wiggum:	Now don't try anything funny this time, Bob.  I'm going to 
	be on you like red beans on ... [Bob speeds up his 
	walking, leaving Wiggum behind] Hey, hey!  Hey, don't walk 
	so fast.  Hey, no fair!  You got long legs, I've got these 
	little bitty hooves.  Bob!
-- The short legs of the law, "Day of the Jackanapes"

% Bob settles in at the Broken Dreams Storage Locker facility.

Raphael:	Okay, here's your storage locker, just the way you 
		left it.
Bob:		Thank you, Raphael.  Now, this is a ticklish 
		question, but ...
Raphael:	You want to live in the box?  Cost you two bucks a 
		day.
Bob:		Oh thank you, kind innkeeper.  [hands Raphael some 
		money]
Raphael:	You gonna wanna wake-up jab?  [makes jabbing motion 
		with a broom handle]
Bob:		Please.
Raphael:	No problemo.
-- It's the Four Seasons of storage lockers, "Day of the Jackanapes"

% Bob works on his scheme for revenge.  Gil butts into Bob's locker, 
% and mentions that several of the other tenants are also plotting
% vengeance.  Bob insists his plan is better and brusquely shuts the
% locker door.
%
% Later, Bob stands in front of Springfield Elementary.  Phase one of
% his plan is about to begin.  He starts to count it down, but can't
% contain himself, and just runs inside the school.
%
% He ends up in the principal's office, interviewing for a job.

Skinner:	Now Bob, your graduate degrees more than qualify you 
		to be assistant janitor.
Bob:		Well, my [?] blushes.
Skinner:	But I am a bit troubled by your constant attempts to 
		murder people.
Bob:		To be fair, most of those people were Bart Simpson.
Skinner:	[laughs] Good luck!  That kid's like the Road Runner 
		-- he won't go down.
Bob:		Tell me about it.  [both laugh]
Skinner:	You know, Bob?  Your voice would be perfect for the 
		school's morning announcements.
Bob:		Attention:  The French Club picnic has been 
		cancelled.  Quelle dommage.
Skinner:	Ha!  You're hired!
Bob:		It begins.  [laughs maniacally] I mean my ... 
		announcing career.  That's what's beginning.
-- "Day of the Jackanapes"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  8:36]
%
% Bob reads the day's announcements.  A Scottish clan kilt is in the
% lost-and-found bin today.  Willie, standing outside the school in
% his underwear looks hopeful, and then disappointed when he finds out
% its for the wrong clan.  For his final announcement, Bob bids Bart
% Simpson, unescorted, to the old sports equipment shed.  Bart doesn't
% detect anything suspicious in this, and happily makes the eerie walk
% to the isolated shed.
%
% There, he comes face to face with ... Sideshow Bob.

Bob:	Hello, Bart.
Bart:	Oh, it's you, Bob.  How you doin'?
Bob:	No screams?  Not even an "eep"?
Bart:	Hey, I'm not afraid of you.  Every time we tangle, you 
	wind up in jail.  I'm 6 and 0.
Bob:	I admit that the record is a little one-sided, but this 
	time, I cannot fail.  [takes a step, and a rake handle 
	comes up to whack him in the face] Rakes -- my old arch-
	enemy.
Bart:	I thought I was your arch-enemy.
Bob:	I have a life outside of you, Bart.
-- "Day of the Jackanapes"

% Bob ties Bart to a chair.

Bart:	What are you going to do to me?
Bob:	Oh, believe me, I have a plan.  [consults his written 
	plans] Let's see, get job as school janitor, lure Bart to 
	shed, secure same to chair with rope ... ah, here we are:  
	Have Bart kill Krusty.
Bart:	Krusty!  That's the one man I would never kill!
Bob:	Oh, you will kill Krusty, during his final show.  And you 
	won't even know you're doing it.  [takes a quarter out of 
	his pocket, and holds it in front of Bart's eyes] Watch 
	the shiny quarter, Bart.  That's it ... [drops the 
	quarter] Oh dammit, where'd it go?  [looks around on the 
	floor] I needed that for laundry.
Bart:	Hey stupid!
Bob:	[looks at Bart]
Bart:	[laughs] You looked.
Bob:	[grumbles]
-- That 6-0 record is starting to make sense, "Day of the Jackanapes"

% Bob looks around and finds another way to hypnotize Bart.  He takes
% an archery target from the wall, and jabs an arrow into the back of
% it.  Using the arrow as a handle, he twirls the target to make a
% hypnotic spiral pattern.

Bob:	[hypnotically] Watch the spiral, Bart.  Let it entrance 
	you with its twirliness ... twirliness ... you are in my 
	power.
Bart:	I am at your command.
Bob:	I didn't say anything about command.  If you are in my 
	power, say so.
Bart:	I am in your power.
Bob:	Excellent.  Actually, go back to command.  No, power, 
	power!

% At home, Marge gets a message from Krusty.  The family is invited to
% the taping of Krusty's last show.  Bart finally arrives home from
% his brainwashing session, giving Marge the pre-programmed excuse
% that he was at a flower shop.  Homer uses this same excuse to cover
% for a stop at the bar.  Marge looks suspicious, but doesn't
% challenge Bart's story.
%
% Bob decides to check his brainwashing handiwork with a test run.  He
% presents Bart with the big Krusty statue in front of a Krustyburger
% outlet, and gives the boy a bat.  Bart immediately runs to the
% statue and pounds on it, concentrating on the groin area.  Bob is
% overjoyed.  He asks Cletus to capture the moment with his camera.
%
% Inside, a trio of Springfield's policemen witnesses the scene.

Eddie:	Chief, you might want to take a look outside.
Bob:	[to Bart] That's it!  Kill Krusty!  Just like you'll kill
