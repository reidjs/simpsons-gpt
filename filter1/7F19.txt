             Principal Skinner will run the class until a substitute arrives.
Ralph:       What's lyme disease?
Pr. Skinner: I'll field that one.  [goes to blackboard]  Lyme disease
             is spread by small parasites called `ticks'.  [writes `TICKS'
             on blackboard]  When a diseased tick attaches itself to
             you, it begins sucking your blood...
Miss Hoover: [not calmed] Oh...
Pr. Skinner: Malignant spirochetes infect your bloodstream, eventually
             spreading to your spinal fluid and on into the brain.
Miss Hoover: The brain!?  Oh, dear God...
Class:       Wow!

Homer: Museum?  Tomorrow?  Oh, oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning
       on... [thinks to himself] Sleeping?  Eating a big sandwich?  Watching
       TV?  Spending time with the boy! [speaks up]  Spending time with the
       boy!  The boy needs attention, Marge.
Marge: Homer, I've been talking to Lisa, and I'm concerned about your

Bart:  Me too, Mom.  I think you're drifting apart.
Homer: Shut up, boy.
Marge: Homer, please.
Homer: Marge, you don't understand.  I can't do it because...
