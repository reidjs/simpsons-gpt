% The Simpsons are all decked out in their Sunday finest, and eating 
% dinner at Springfield's posh "occasion" restaurant, The Singing
% Sirloin.  Tonight's occasion is truly special:  Bart has received an
% "A" in school.  He's wearing a crown with an "A" motif while waiters
% serenade him with "Happy First 'A'" (sung to the tune of "Happy
% Birthday").

Now that our son is an honor student, I'm going to get one of those 
bumper stickers that informs strangers of that fact.
-- Marge Simpson, "Homer vs. Dignity"

% Lisa gripes a bit about the lack of recognition, but Homer continues
% to shower attention on his son.

Marge:		An "A" in astronomy!  How'd you do it?
Bart:		I just buckled down and studied.
Homer:		[laughs] No, really.
Bart:		Well, it all started last week in Krabappel's class.
		[dissolve to Krabappel's classroom.  Bart stands 
		alone, at a couple of animal cages in the back of 
		the room]
		[voice-over] I was trying to breed the hamster with 
		the lizard to create an unholy supercreature, when I 
		saw an even worse crime against nature.
		[Skinner and Krabappel enter the room, kissing.  
		Bart hides in the coat closet]
Skinner:	Ah, head lice inspection day.  While the kids are 
		out getting their nits picked, we can have our own 
		private cootie call.
Krabappel:	Oh, you talk too much.  Let's do it on Martin's 
		desk.
Skinner:	It is usually the cleanest.  [brushes a pencil off 
		the desk]
Bart:		[voice-over] I needed to get my mind on something 
		else -- anything else.  And for the first time in my 
		life, education was the answer.
		[notices a chart of the Solar System on the wall]
		Mercury ... Venus ... Earth ... Mars ...
Skinner:	[offscreen] C'mon Edna, don't be tardy!
Bart:		Mercury ... Venus ... Earth ... Mars ... Jupiter ... 
		Saturn ... Uranus ... Neptune ... Pluto.
		[back to the present]
		So when I took the test, the answers were stuck in 
		my brain.  It was like a whole different kind of 
		cheating!
Marge:		Well, we couldn't be prouder.
-- "Homer vs. Dignity"

% That feeling of pride isn't about to last long.  A waiter appears
% and informs Homer that his credit card has been declined.  Homer
% stalls for a few seconds, then throws a fistful of equally worthless
% credit cards in the waiter's face.  The Simpsons bolt for the door,
% but the hostess manages to stop their escape attempt.
%
% To work off their debt, the family is put to work as a Latin band,
% singing "La Bamba."  The Maitre D' praises their technical
% proficiency, but says the singing lacks passion.  In response, Homer
% launches into a passionate rendition of "Spanish Eyes."
%
% Finally, the restaurant closes for the night, and the Simpsons are
% sent on their way.

Marge:	When did this happen?  When did we become the bottom rung 
	of society?
Homer:	I think it was when that cold snap killed off all the 
	hobos.
Lisa:	Dad, what happened to the back seat?  [camera shifts to 
	reveal that the back seat and rear floor are missing.  
	Bart and Lisa stand precariously on the chassis rails]
Homer:	I had to sell it for gas money.  [the car sputters to a 
	stop] Which I spent on a novelty horn.  [bangs his head on 
	the steering wheel, which triggers a horn that plays 
	"Charge!"]
Marge:	Homer, we need to talk to a financial planner.
Homer:	Financial panther, eh?
	[imagines himself standing in a bank lobby with an 
	officious banker]
Banker:	Mr. Simpson, you're a dollar overdrawn.
Homer:	Get him, Sheba!
	[a panther leaps onscreen and mauls the banker]
	[back to reality]
	I'm on board.
-- When Sheba talks, people listen, "Homer vs. Dignity"

% Homer and Marge pay a visit to Let's Get Fiscal, a financial-
% planning firm.

Planner:	You haven't set aside anything for the future.
Wiggum:		Ah, you know how it is with cops.  I'll get shot 
		three days before retirement.  In the business, we 
		call it, "retirony."
Planner:	What if you don't get shot?
Wiggum:		What a terrible thing to say.  [Sarah begins to cry] 
		Now look, you've made my wife cry.
-- "Homer vs. Dignity"

% Meanwhile, Lindsay Neagle assesses the Simpsons' financial standing.

Neagle:	Well, I see you have several mortgages, credit card debt, 
	no savings, and you're supporting your father?
Homer:	Just give the word, and I'll cut him off.
Neagle:	I couldn't ask you to do that.
Homer:	Consider it done.
Neagle:	Based on these figures, I'm afraid you'll need to declare 
	bankruptcy ... several times.  Just look at this 
	projection.
	[shows Homer and Marge a computerized picture of the 
	family.  As happy music plays, they get older, and poorer.  
	Finally, they are stooped-over, worn-out bums]
Homer:	[gasps] Marge, your posture looks terrible!
Neagle:	What's interesting is, you'll continue losing money even 
	after you're dead.  Your gravesites will go untended and 
	vandalized.  [a computerized (aged) Nelson knocks over 
	Homer's headstone, laughs, and then coughs]
	Mr. Simpson, your intelligence profile indicates that 
	you're too "stupid" to stick to a budget.
Homer:	Yes, go on.
Neagle:	So let me put this simply.  You need more money.
Homer:	How do I get it?
Neagle:	I'm a financial *planner*, not a financial *consultant.*
Homer:	Sorry.
Neagle:	Now, I'd like my fee, please.
	[Homer scribbles something on a piece of paper, hands it 
	to Ms. Neagle, and grunts]
	[reads the paper, and looks up] I know you're not a deaf-
	mute, Mr. Simpson; we've been talking for the last twenty 
	minutes.
	[Homer throws a fistful of credit cards at Ms. Neagle, 
	grabs Marge, and runs away.]

% At the power plant, Smithers approaches Mr. Burns.

Smithers:	Sir, I have a small personal request.
Burns:		Oh, of course, Smithers.  Anything.  [repeatedly 
		pushes a button marked, "Trap Door"]
Smithers:	I disabled the button, sir.  [Burns keeps pushing 
		it] Anyway, I need some time off.  As you know, I've 
		been writing a musical about the Malibu Stacy doll--
Burns:		[gives up on the button] A show about a doll?  
		[laughs] Why not write a musical about the common 
		cat?  Or the King of Siam?  Give it up, Smithers.
Smithers:	Actually, sir, we're booked into a small theater in 
		New Mexico.
Burns:		Whoa, slow down there, maestro.  There's a *New* 
		Mexico?
-- "Homer vs. Dignity"

% Smithers tells his boss that he'll be gone for a week.  Burns
% approves the time off, saying that he can amuse himself.  To prove
% his point, he pulls out a novelty pistol that ejects a flag with
% "Bang!" printed on it.  He fires it at Smithers, and (after a bit of
% fidgeting) the flagpole pops out and sticks in Smithers's chest.
%
% Burns takes advantage of his underling's presence to explore the
% power plant, looking for some fun.  He spots a candy machine, but it
% doesn't fulfil his verbal request for toffee.
%
% In the cafeteria, Homer fortifies his courage with some beer.  He
% tells his lunch mates, Lenny and Carl, that he will ask Burns for a
% raise.  The opportunity comes sooner than he expects when Burns
% discovers the cafeteria and walks in.
%
% Burns tries to get something from the salad bar, but is stymied by
% the sneeze guard.

Burns:	What is this?  Some kind of force field around these 
	vegetables.
Homer:	That's the sneeze guard.  You have to lean under it to get 
	salad and to sneeze on stuff.  [pushes Burns's head under 
	the glass, and leans under there himself]
Burns:	Ah, everything's so green and alive.  [picks up some 
	vegetable and sniffs.  The greens immediately shrivel and 
	turn brown]
Homer:	Mr. Burns, I was wondering if I could get a raise?
	[the two men stand up again]
Burns:	What kind of a raise?
Homer:	[weakly] Whopping?
Burns:	I see.  You have thirty seconds to wow me.
Homer:	Well, sir, you see sir, I've worked here a long time, and 
	my wife has a game leg, and my kids have game things as 
	well.
Burns:	I don't want to hear your whining.  I'm a bored and 
	joyless old man.  Give me a larf!
Homer:	A larf?  Okay, let's see what's in the news today.
Burns:	Oh, for the love of ... [picks up a small bowl of pudding]
	[to Homer] Hurl this ... [points to Lenny] ... at that!
Homer:	At Lenny?  But he's a war hero.
Burns:	Well, let's decorate him, then.
Homer:	No!
Burns:	Not even for four dollars?  [holds up the cash]
	[Homer throws the pudding, which strikes Lenny square in 
	the face]
Lenny:	Ow!  My eye!  I'm not supposed to get pudding in it.
Burns:	[laughs] That was capital!  My lung is aching.
Homer:	I liked when I threw the pudding.
Burns:	Do it again.  I'll make it an even eight.  [holds up some 
	more bills]
Homer:	You're the boss.  [throws another serving of pudding, 
	which again hits Lenny]
Lenny:	Ow!  I'm in Hell!  [Burns and Homer laugh]
Burns:	Let's keep the laughs coming, eh, Simpson?  Let's say I 
	make you my Executive in Charge of Recreation -- no, no, 
	better yet, my Prank Monkey.
Homer:	Will you keep giving me money?
Burns:	I can't have my little monkey running around in rags.
Homer:	Woo hoo!
-- "Homer vs. Dignity"

% In delight, Homer lobs a pudding at Carl.  Burns is *not* amused by

% Homer and Burns prowl the streets of Springfield, looking
% opportunities to play pranks on people.  They spot Comic Book Guy in
% his store, wolfing down marshmallow Peeps.  ("If only the real
% chicks went down this easy," CBG laments, to no one in particular.) 
% Burns decides this is a great chance to stir up some mischief.  He
% dispatches Homer to the store, along with a briefcase.

Homer:	I'd like to buy a mint condition "Spider-Man #1," please.
CBG:	I'd like an hour on the holodeck with Seven of Nine.
	[Homer puts the briefcase on the counter and opens it.  It 
	is stuffed full of money]
	Oh, Saturn's rings!  Let me get that for you.
	[with a dramatic flourish, CBG enters a combination into a 
	keypad under the counter.  A tube rises up, containing a 
	copy of the first "Spider-Man" comic.  It has a price tag 
	of $20,000.  CBG carefully plucks it out with a pair of 
	tweezers and presents it to Homer]
	Paper bag, or triple mylar?
Homer:	Eh, no thanks.  I'll just eat it here.
	[rips a page out of the book and eats it]
CBG:	Oh, oh, no!  What are you doing?
	[Homer continues to eat.  CBG collapses to the floor, 
	crying.  Nonchalant, Homer finishes the comic book, helps 
	himself to a Peep, and rejoins Burns in front of the 
	store]
Burns:	That was uproarious.  First-rate job, monkey.

% Homer asks for his fee, and Burns amuses himself further by tossing
% a fistful of cash at him.  As Homer grovels on the ground to gather
% the scattered bills, a bicyclist runs over him.  Burns declares
% Homer much more fun than Smithers.
%
% Hey, speaking of Smithers, how's his play going?  The scene cuts to
% a theater in Albuquerque.  On the stage is a life-size Malibu Stacy
% Corvette.  Smithers and an actress playing Stacy are sitting on the
% hood, in the stiff-limbed manner of girls' dolls.  The music comes
% up, and Smithers begins to sing.

Smithers:	Sold separately,
		Sometimes I feel like I've been
		Sold separately.
		But out of the box I find you poseable ...
			[turns to Stacy]
Stacy:		Loveable ...
			[turns to Smithers]
Both:		Just ... like ... me.

% For their next prank, Burns and Homer hide out in the men's room at
% Springfield Stadium.  When the time is right, Burns shoves Homer,
% who is wearing only a giant diaper, onto the crowded bathroom floor. 
% The men's room patrons are horrified -- as is a rich woman socialite
% who just popped in because the women's room had a line.  Burns
% delights in the chaos he has caused, and passes Homer some money.

% Later, the family is at Dr. Hibbert's office.

Hibbert:	[after giving Bart a shot] There, that's six years' 
		worth of inoculations.
Homer:		[hands Hibbert a roll of money] There you are, my 
		good man.  And while you're at it, throw in one of 
		those polio shots.
Hibbert:	Ooh, yes, sir.  [picks up a hypodermic needle]
Homer:		Eh -- anti-polio.
		[Hibbert picks up a bigger needle]
Marge:		Where did you get that ball of money?
Homer:		I've been doing some outside projects for Mr. Burns.
Marge:		Really?  Like what?
Homer:		Ah, you know, business stuff -- downsizing, e-
		solutions, the glass ceiling ...
Marge:		Oh.  Well, I'm proud of you.  [hugs Homer] You're 
		such a good provider.  Kids, come on, thank your 
		father for the injections.
Bart & Lisa:	[grudgingly, while rubbing their arms] Thank you, 
		Dad.

% The scene shifts to the Springfield Zoo, which is ballyhooing its
% new panda exhibit.  The bears have drawn a large crowd of the
% curious, who also buy panda-related souvenirs.

Milhouse:	Hey, Dad, can I have some money for a panda cone?
Kirk:		Gah -- what do you do with the $68 I send your 
		mother every month?
Milhouse:	Weekday dad wanted a DVD player.

% Behind the panda exhibit, Burns prepares Homer for his latest stunt. 
% The Prank Monkey is dressed in a panda suit.  Burns gleefully
% anticipates the look on the town's faces when they find out their

% to do the Lindy Hop, and Burns assures him that's the heart of the
% bit.  Then he helps Homer put on the big panda head, completing the
% costume.

		Don't be shy.  That-a-girl.  Oh, I think she's 
		getting ready to ... [Homer starts dancing] Yes, 
		she's doing the Lindy Hop.
Burns:		That's it.  Twenty-three skidoo.  Twenty-four, 
		twenty-five skidoo.
Zookeeper:	Well, it looks like Sim-Sim is a little frisky 
		today, so our trainers are going to calm her down.  
		[two animal handlers appear, holding what look like 
		cattle prods.  They begin zapping Homer]
		Don't worry, folks.  Because of their thick, thick 
		hides, pandas only feel the slightest tickle from 
		these powerful electric shocks.
		[Homer screams in pain, but his cries are muffled by 
		the panda costume]
Handler:	Oh, she's saying, "I love you."  [audience cheers]
Homer:		[while getting shocked] Can't ... take the ... pain 
		... ow!  Aagh!  [collapses.  Smoke pours out of the 
		costumes eye-holes]
Ralph:		Sim-Sim likes to boogie.
Lisa:		Something's wrong.  Terribly wrong.
-- You think?  "Homer vs. Dignity"

% A male panda -- a *real* male panda -- lumbers into the panda pit.

		With any luck, folks, these two will become very, 
		very close, if you know what I mean.
		[Ping-Ping sniffs, and approaches Homer]
Homer:		Huh?  Help!  Mr. Burns!  [Burns laughs]
		[Homer gets up and tries to run away, but he trips 
		and lands on a boulder, with his butt sticking up in 
		the air]

% him in the face.  This is where his daughter finds him.

% We've already done the gun plot, and the Christmas holiday season is

% on a nail in the bench and tears away, leaving him naked.  The
% socialite happens by and faints at the sight.
%
% Later, Homer (dressed) goes to Costington's with a basket of money
% to buy toys.  His charity is reported to upper management, and Homer
% is invited to meet Mr. Costington himself.

		problem myself.  I'm still not allowed on the third 
		floor.
Homer:		That's okay.  [they hug each other]
