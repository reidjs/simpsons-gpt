% here.  Marge gets it and looks through it in the kitchen, where
% everyone is having breakfast.  Bills, a free gasoline sample, and the
% Simpsons are out of the Publisher's Clearing House running, to Marge's
% dismay.  Also, Lisa got a German verb wheel from the Foreign Language
% Institute.  Homer got a new issue of CarToons, which he laughs his
% head off at.  [Or is that, "at which he laughs off his head"? -- Ed.]
% Bart complains that he never gets anything in the mail.  As a
% consolation, Marge gives him the junk mail, most of which is termite-
% themed.  ("SAVE the termites?")  But one letter catches his attention.
% He reads it in his room.
%
% The letter notifies Bart that the Simpsons have such a fine credit
% history, therefore they have been pre-approved for a charge card from
% MoneyBank.  So, he fills in the credit card application form with
% phony information and under the Name entry, Bart uses the dog's name.
%
% Six to eight weeks later, the mail comes, and Homer is notified of it
% the same way as before.  Bills, bills, rejection letter from the New
% Yorkers Subscription department, and Bart's credit card, issued to
% "Santos L. Halper."

Bart:     Wow!  My own credit card!  [kisses SLH]  Thanks, Santos!

%
% A while later, Bart receives a package from Covet House mail-order.
% Bart has "bought" the entire family odd presents.  When Marge asks him

%
% Lisa walks through the hallway, but stops by Bart's lavishly

Lisa:     You can't afford this.  How can you afford this?
Bart:     Ahh you've been all edgy and suspicious ever since I gave you
          those Pep Pills.
Lisa:     [peppy and speedy] What are you talking about-I don't need
          pep pills to be suspicious-If I wanna comment on it, I'll
          comment on it-Who's gonna stop me-You, Pep Pill Boy?-Pep boys-

% 800 bred dogs that are considered to be possibly the "World's Best
% Dog."  Bart picks up his phone, but sees the price.

Twelve hundred bucks??  I better just get one.
-- Bart orders "quite possibly the World's Best Dog," "The Canine
   Mutiny"

% A few mornings later, Bart gets up and answers the door (SLH runs out
% the door quite eagerly).  A delivery truck leaves behind a huge crate,
% and Bart's ordered dog, looking much like a male Lassie, is inside.
% The dog jumps out the crate, leaving Bart to find the card that
% introduces the dog as Laddie, and he is trained to bring Bart fruit as
% a welcoming gift.  Enticed by Laddie, Bart walks in with the dog and
% leaves Santa's Little Helper outside.
%
% After Laddie scares Snowball II out of the kitchen, Bart introduces
% the dog to Marge and Lisa.  Laddie does a trick -- backflipping --
% then Marge and Lisa admire the new dog.  Homer walks obliviously into
% the kitchen.

Homer:    Hi, Marge.  Hi, Santa's Little Helper.  Hi, kids.  HEY!
          That's not Santa's Little Helper!
Marge:    That's Laddie!  Bart says he won him at a church carnival two

Lisa:     ...in a truth-telling contest, right, Bart?
Bart:     Ah, to the best of my recollection.  Yes.

Homer:    Oh yeah.  A dog like this you have to feed everyday.

% Bart extols the virtues of his new pooch.

Bart:     He's trained to do all sorts of stuff.  He can herd sheep and

Marge:    [reads from the manual] Some call it the dog that never
          sleeps, though it actually does -- while jogging!
Homer:    Gee, that dog has more education than I do!

%
% Bart gets a ring on his cel-phone in the middle of the night.

Bart:     Hello?
Creditor: Hello, Mr. Halper.  I'm calling from MoneyBank Credit
          Services Department.  I was wondering if you had a chance to
          read the threatening letter we sent you.
Bart:     Daaah...?
Creditor: [condescendingly] Because you sound like a mature,
          responsible person, who wouldn't want an unpaid credit card
          bill to spoil all his hopes and dreams for the future.
          Dreams such as home ownership, boat ownership and event-
          attendance!  Now, when can I tell my supervisor, Mr.
          Robinson, to expect payment?
          [Laddie takes the phone into his mouth and hangs it up]
Bart:     [nervously relieved] Good dog.

% "C'mon, boy!  Let's go for a walk," yells Bart.  When he opens the
% front door, SLH bursts through and licks Bart lovingly, but Bart
% pushes him aside. He was asking for Laddie, because he has a job for
% him.
%
% Somewhere, Bart has Laddie dig a hole through the ground, and Bart
% drops his abused, ill-gotten credit card down the hole.  To their
% left, Fat Tony and his boys are disposing of a body.  Louie sees Bart
% and says, "We didn't see nothin' if you didn't see nothin'."
%
% En route home, Bart sees Repo Men taking Bart's things.  Worried,

% hesitates to decide which dog to give away:  SLH or Laddie.  "Well, is
% he the dog, or isn't he??" presses the Repo Man.  Bart gulps, and says
% "Yeah.  That's him, all right."  So, SLH is loaded into a Repo van.
% "Sorry, boy.  I didn't plan this.  It just sort of happened," is
% Bart's parting words to SLH as the Repo van drives away.  Laddie licks
% Bart's hand and trots off, while Bart looks down glumly.

% [End of Act One.  Time: 8:33]

% On another morning, Marge gives Bart the OK to just once feed Laddie

Homer:    Do you think he noticed?
Marge:    [rolls eyes] [sneakishly puts on lipstick to impress Laddie]
-- A family not fit for a dog, "The Canine Mutiny"

% can catch a Frisbee.  Laddie, ahead of the flying Frisbee, catches it
