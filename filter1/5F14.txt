% bill. Burns catches Homer red-handed, but seems to think he's a journalist
% from Colliers Magazine and wants to put Burns in "star snoop". Homer plays

% Government. They make people like Homer pay income taxes for worthless
% causes. Burns yells back to Homer, telling him not to let the Government
% push him around. He has a voice -- Colliers Magazine! Homer is inspired by

% unconscious.

Take that, Uncle Sam!

Mr. Burns: Capitol idea! Let's blow this fascist popsicle stand! Purchase a

    Homer: But I can't leave the country, what about my wife and kids?
 Smithers: [unimpressed] That can be shipped.

Mr. Burns: Yes, I too feel renewed appreciation for the good old US of A.
           Oppression and harrassment are a small price to pay to live in the
           land of the free.
 Smithers: Sir, aren't you facing some serious jail time?
Mr. Burns: Well, if it's a crime to love one's country, then I'm guilty. And
           if it's a crime to steal a trillion dollars from our government and
           hand it over to communist Cuba, then I'm guilty of that too. And if
