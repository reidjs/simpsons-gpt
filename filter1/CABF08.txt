% Inside the store, CBG introduces Mr. Savini.

Homer:		[in audience] Woo!  Dinner!
Savini:		But I'm sure one more French fry wouldn't hurt.  
		[eats one, and then blows up like a balloon, until 
		he's several feet in diameter.  Then, he pops, 
		showering the audience with simulated gore.  The 
		audience applauds]
Milhouse:	Oh, we missed the Gut-Buster.
Bart:		Yeah, that should be us covered with blood.
-- "Worst Episode Ever"

% Later, Mr. Savini explains that while computers have made big
% changes in the field, there will always be a place for the practical
% special effects expert.  (That is, someone who works with "real"
% objects and models, rather than virtual ones.)  To demonstrate his
% own special effects mastery, Savini answers this question with his
% head apparently detached from his body.  He picks it up and re-
attaches it, as the audience cheers.  Well, most of the audience.

CBG:	Oh, please.  I saw Paul Lynde do that same hackneyed trick 
	on "Bewitched."  [eats a cookie]  Try to explode this out 
	of my belly.
Savini:	That's not a cookie.  [blood runs out of CBG's mouth]
	It's a time-release blood pack.
	[grossed out, CBG wipes his mouth on his shirt]
	You sir, are a perfect patsy.  Let me shake your hand.  
	[he and CBG shake hands.  Savini's hand pops out of its 
	sleeve]
CBG:	[considering the disembodied hand] The gag I would give a 
	D+.  As for the workmanship on the hand ... [suddenly, the 
	hand comes to life, runs down CBG's back, and gives him a 
	wedgie] Ooh!  That's not right!

	*You* mocking *me*!  Oh, that is rich.  [the hand wedgies 
	him harder, tugging him right off the stage.  He lands on
