       there could be some poison gas, I I mean there's really going to
       be poison gas, and everybody's going to be dead, Especially me!
        [car drives away]
       D'oh!
-- So much for plan A, "King-Size Homer"

% An ice cream truck drives into view.  Homer flags it down and starts
% blabbering again.

 Homer: Hey, buddy, you got to let me in your car --
Vendor: [frightened] Take anything you want, man!  Take it all!
-- Homer vs. Big Chief Krazy Kone, "King-Size Homer"

% Homer pushes him out of the truck and drives away.  Cut to Burns and
% Smithers leading exercise at the SNPP.  Burns entreats, "Push out the
% jive...bring in the love."  On the school bus, Ralph is sitting behind
% Lisa.

Ralph: I heard your dad went into a restaurant and ate everything in the
       restaurant and they had to close the restaurant.
 Lisa: Hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some
       kind of food-crazed maniac.
Homer: [driving past the bus, stuffing his face] Oh, that's raspberry!
-- Well, not usually, anyway, "King-Size Homer"

% Homer crashes through the gate at the SNPP.  The exercise crowd gets
% excited upon seeing the ice-cream truck.

Burns: Workers, please!  There will be time for the frozen pudding wagon
       later.  You still owe me ten more Iroquois Twists!
        [The crowd obeys.]
       Ten Hi Ya Ya...
        [shout]
       and Nine Hi Ya Ya...
-- Aerobatic devotion, "King-Size Homer"

% Homer drives up the side of one of the cooling towers, some workers
% holding frantically onto the sides of the truck.

    Homer: Get away, damn it!  Run for your lives!
Worker #1: I'll take a rocket pop!
Worker #2: What can I get for thirty cents!?
    Homer: Let go, I've got to get to the tank!
            [the truck crashes and tips on its side; Homer runs out]
Worker #3: Heck, I can't decide without the pictures.
-- "King-Size Homer"

% Homer climbs the side of the ready to burst tank.  He passes signs
% pointing to the "manual shutdown" switch.  As the workers count off
% the last few Iroquois Twists, Homer struggles to reach the switch,
% only to fall and grab clutching at the catwalk above the tank.
% "Stupid switch!" he laments, "I wish I had my reaching broom!  Wait a
% minute, there's probably a --" The tank explodes, venting green gas
% with great force.  Homer falls screaming into the tank opening, his
% tremendous girth sealing the opening and ending the crisis.

% Later, all the employees gather to applaud Homer.

Burns: Homer, your bravery and quick thinking have turned a potential
       Chernobyl into a mere Three Mile Island.  Bravo!
        [Places an award around Homer's neck.]
 Lisa: I think it's ironic that Dad saved the day while a slimmer man
       would have fallen to his death.
 Bart: And I think it's ironic that for once Dad's butt prevented the
       release of toxic gas --
Marge: Bart!
Burns: [to Homer]
       We'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you
       decontaminated.
Homer: Thank you Mr. Burns --
        [giggles as the technicians hose off his lower half]
       It was pretty scary up there -- [laughs] -- for a while I feared
       for my life -- [laughs more]
Burns: Now Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you...please
       don't hesitate to ask.
Homer: [gazing at Marge before answering]
       Mr. Burns, can you make me thin again?
Burns: I guarantee it.
-- Give him a week..., "King-Size Homer"

% Cut to the exercise yard at night.  Mr. Burns is leading a chant while
% Homer tries to do sit-ups.

Burns: One...ONE....ONE!
        [Homer struggles to do one situp.]
       Bah, I'll just pay for the blasted liposuction!
Homer: Woo hoo!
-- The easy way out, "King-Size Homer"
