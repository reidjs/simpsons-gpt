% The front of the Simpsons residence.  From left to right:  Bart smugly
% holds a skateboard.  Maggie sucks on her pacifier.  Lisa holds a jumprope.
%
% Lisa sweetly asks...

L: Whatcha doin', Bart?
B: Skateboarding.
L: Can we come?
B: No way, man.

% Bart proudly walks in front of the girls down the front walk.

B: Skateboarding's men's work.
L: [teasing] Then why are <you> doing it?

% Bart sneers briefly.

B: Because I <am> a man, man!

% Bart has reached the top of a steep hill.  He studly tosses his skateboard
% to the sidewalk, hops on, and scoots off, trailing a cloud of dust.

B: Cowabunga!

% Close-up on Bart's upper body, cruising down the hill, his arms
% outstretched, the wind breezing through his hair.  A boy and his
% skateboard.  (Oops, sorry.  A man and his skateboard.)  Poetry in
% motion.  Bart closes his eyes frequently, enjoying the ride.

B: Ah, the breeze.  The solitude.  The wind whistling through your hair.

% Pull back to reveal the two girls sitting on the skateboard with him.

L: Go, man, go!

% Bart looks down.

B: Huh?

% Back to the top of the hill.  Bart and the girls.  Lisa's arms are
% folded in front of her chest.  Bart's skateboard is poised for action.

B: Watch this.  Here goes the daredevil skateboard champion of the universe!

% Bart hops on his skateboard and zooms off.

% Close-up on Bart's upper body.

B: [turning]  So long, suckers!

% Pull back.  Bart is skateboarding on one leg.
%
% Lisa pulls up on her own skateboard, standing on her head.

L: [calmly] Hi, Bart.

% Bart reacts, stunned.  Lisa pulls ahead out of frame.

L: Bye, Bart.

% Bart can only watch.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:43]
%
% Bart and Lisa are at the top of the hill, each with their skateboard
% in front of them, ready to race.  Maggie watches.

B: Okay.  Ready?  Get set? ... Hey, look over there!

% Lisa does...

B: Go!

% ... and by the time she looks back, Bart is long gone.
%
% Close-up on Bart's upper body as he cackles.
%
% Lisa pulls up next to him on her skateboard.   But Bart grits his
% teeth, and Lisa falls behind.  He laughs some more.  Then Maggie
% passes on her own mini-skateboard.
