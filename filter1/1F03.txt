Homer: What the hell's so funny?
  Man: At the Apple Biscuit cafe, where the smiles are free, don't you

% Just then, the doorbell rings.  Marge opens the door to discover Ruth

% Ruth and Marge sit in the "Jittery Joe's Coffee Shop" sipping coffee.

Marge: Your point being?

% When Marge arrives home, Homer tries to explain what happened.

Homer: Marge, I know you didn't believe me about the vending machines.

Marge: [reads] "Mrs. Simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a

Homer: D'oh!  [sadly] Lumber has a million uses.
-- Even worse, "Marge on the Lam"

Marge: I'm disappointed in you.  But it turns out I had a wonderful time

       I'm sorry, I should have asked first.
-- Always considerate, "Marge on the Lam"

% Ruth is inspired by Marge's courage: "We really are going to make it
% now!"  But Wiggum and Homer realize something.

Wiggum: Oh, no!  They're headed right for the Grand Chasm!
 Homer: Oh my God!  They're going to drive right into it just to teach
        us men a lesson.  And it's all my fault!
-- A heavy burden, "Marge on the Lam"

% Homer grabs a bullhorn and leans out the window of the speeding police
% car.

Homer: [into bullhorn] Marge, Marge!
Marge: Homer?
Homer: Look Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband.  I'm sorry
       about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub.  I'm sorry I
       used your wedding dress to wax the car.  And I'm sorry -- oh
       well, let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this
       point.
Marge: [to Ruth] You're right: I _am_ lucky to have him.
-- Stand by your man, "Marge on the Lam"

% Homer begs Marge not to drive into the chasm.  "Chasm?!"  Ruth and
% Marge cry together.  Ruth slams on the brakes, halting the car just
% before it tumbles over the precipice.  Homer and Wiggum, on the other
% hand, aren't able to stop in time.  Fortunately, the nose of the car
% lands vertically in a big pile of garbage.

Wiggum: Hah!  And to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting
        this landfill!
 Homer: It's solid waste...I could kiss you!
         [kisses it] Ew...
         [kisses it] Ooh...
         [kisses it] Argh!
         [kisses it] Ooh...I think _this_ was pizza.
-- With bile topping, perhaps, "Marge on the Lam"

% A narrator explains the fate of the main characters.

Narrator: Ruth Powers was tried in Springfield Superior Court.  The
          judge dismissed her ex-husband's auto theft charges and forced
          him to pay all back child support.  Mr. Powers blamed the
          outcome on his lawyer, one Lionel Hutz.
          Lionel Hutz, AKA Miguel Sanchez, AKA Dr. Nguyen Van Falk, was
          paid eight dollars for his thirty-two hours of babysitting.
          He was glad to get it.
          Marge Simpson was charged with a violation of penal code
          section 618A: Wanton Destruction of Precious Antique Cans.
          She was ordered to pay fifty cents to replace the cans, and
          $2000 in punitive damages and mental anguish.
          Homer Simpson was remanded to the custody of the United States
          Army Neurochemical Research Center at Fort Meade, Maryland,
          for extensive testing.
   Homer: Woo-hoo!
