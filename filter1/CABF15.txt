% a cow to what looks like a refrigeration unit.  Several gray rubber
% tubes are wrapped around her midsection, with wires trailing off to
% some equipment.  For all that, she doesn't look uncomfortable, and
% Frink was nice enough to provide her with a scarf, a pair of
% earmuffs, and four boots.

Frink:	I've created the first intra-bovine ice cream maker.  It 
	makes use of all four stomachs, the first being filled 
	with rock salt, then sugar, cream, and of course Freon, so 
	cold it burns me.
Cletus:	I'll have the darkity kind.
Frink:	[to the cow] Ah, one chocolate, Moo-tilda.

Marge:	Can I have a swirl of chocolate and vanilla?

Homer:	Let Ned alone.
Ned:	Thank you, Homer.
Homer:	He can't admit he likes her until he's sure she likes him

Rachel:		They switched from Christian music to regular pop.  
		All you do is switch "Jesus" to "baby".

Rachel:		[dismissive] Oh, they'll all go to Hell.  Say, how's 
		your life going?

Marge:	Are you okay, Ned?

Ned:	Why, thanks, Homer.
Homer:	No problem.  I'll need a sack and something sharp.
