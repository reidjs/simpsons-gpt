% At the Simpsons' breakfast table, Homer reads the newspaper.

Ah, the morning horoscope.  "Today will be a day like every other day"
-- D'oh!  It just gets worse and worse.
-- Homer the pessimist, "Bart Gets Famous"

% Bart walks down the stairs in his lucky red hat, whistling the theme
% music to "The Simpsons".  Marge chides him for whistling "that
% annoying tune."  Bart responds cheerfully, "Jahwol, mein Mommerant."

 Lisa: [to Bart] Why are you so happy?
Homer: Yeah.  You kids gotta go to school, I gotta go to work; the only
       one who has it easy is Marge.
        [Marge scrubs at the floor, grunting]
-- Easy is relative, "Bart Gets Famous"

Bart: We're having a field trip today!  Ah, Lis, won't it be great to
      cast of the shackles of the soul-crushing hellhole that is
      Springfield Elementary?  [sarcastically] Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot:
      your class isn't going!
Lisa: You're right, Bart: school is for losers.

      reunited the entire cast of TV's `Facts of Life', including long-
      time holdout, Tootie."
Bart: [polishing Lisa's awards] [groans] Sounds like another Pulitzer
      for me to polish.
Lisa: Hush, field-trip boy!
       [Lisa kicks Bart]
      Impaled on my Nobel Peace Prize: how ironic.
       [back to reality]

% In the fourth-grade classroom, Mrs. Krabappel introduces Seymour.

   Edna: And now, Principal Skinner will tell us where we'll be going on
         this year's field trip.
Skinner: Thank you, Edna, everyone.  [clears throat] Now, class, I
         wonder who among you can tell me what this is?  [shows a box]
   Edna: Oh, not the box factory again, Seymour!
          [Class groans]
 Martin: This may well prove fascinating!
   Bart: I know: I'll just do like Lisa and escape into fantasy!
          [Bart imagines Seymour]
Skinner: Class, instead of going to the box factory today, we'll be
         going to the...box factory!
   Bart: Damn TV, you've ruined my imagination, just like you've ruined
         my ability to -- to, um...uh...oh well.  [Turns on Itchy &
         Scratchy on a portable TV]
-- The source of the world's problems, "Bart Gets Famous"

% On the bus to the factory, Martin and Seymour sing a duet: "Fifty-six
% boxes of bottles of beer on the wall, fifty-six boxes of bottles of
% beer, you take one down and pass it around, fifty-five boxes of
% bottles of beer on the wall."  Just then, they drive by an amusement
% park, complete with fireworks testing range and slide factory.  School
% buses from many other places are parked in front, and most of grade
% four (including Mrs. Krabappel) stare longingly out the window, but
% their bus drives on.
%
% Arriving at the box factory, Skinner and Martin are the first ones off
% the bus.  Bart and Edna walk off together, looking bored.
%
% Once inside the factory, their tour guide tells them a story.

The story of how two brothers (and five other men) parlayed a small
business loan into a thriving paper-goods concern is a long and
interesting one.  And, here it is: it all began with the filing of form
637/A, the application for a small business or farm...
-- The box factory's tour guide, "Bart Gets Famous"

% At the end of the story, the tour guide continues.

   Guide: Many interesting and important things have been put into boxes
          over the years: textiles, other boxes, even children's candy.
Milhouse: Do any of these boxes have candy in them?
   Guide: No.
Milhouse: Will they ever?
   Guide: No, we only make boxes to ship nails.  Any other questions?
  Martin: When will we be able to see a finished box, Sir?
   Guide: Well, we don't assemble them here -- that's done in Flint,
          Michigan.
    Bart: Have any of the workers ever had their hands cut off by the
          machinery?
   Guide: No --
    Bart: And then the hand started crawling around and tried to
          strangle everybody?
   Guide: No, that has never happened.
    Bart: Any popped eyeballs?
   Guide: I'm not sure what kind of factory you're thinking of; we just
          make boxes here.
-- Q&A at the box factory, "Bart Gets Famous"

   Guide: This room is the most popular part of our tour.
Milhouse: It's just like the other rooms.
   Guide: Yes, but with one important difference: [looks over] Oh, they
          took that out.  Yes, it is just like the other rooms.
Milhouse: [pointing out the window] What's that building over there?
   Guide: That's just a TV studio where they film Krusty the Klown and
          other non-box-related programs.  Since it has nothing to do
          with boxes, I'll just shut these blinds.
-- Keeping attention focused, "Bart Gets Famous"

% The tour guide shows them his office, and calls their attention to the
% yellow line entering the room, encircling his desk, and leaving the
% room.  He entreats them to follow it.  Seymour and Martin go first,
% and everyone follows in a line.  Everyone, that is, except Bart.  "I
% gotta get out of here," he says desperately.  "Ah ha!" he exclaims,
% spying a laundry cart, "The perfect escape!"  He runs over to it,
% looks around, and jumps in.  Nothing happens, so he gets out again and
% walks out a door marked "Emergency Exit".
%
% He wanders over to the aforementioned TV studio, and looks around near
% the entrance gate.  A security guard wearing mirrored shades
% approaches him.

Guard: [condescending] Do you work here, little boy?
 Bart: Yeah!
Guard: [formal] Well then, go right in, Sir!
-- Bart's deceptive!, "Bart Gets Famous"

% Meanwhile, the rest of the fourth graders scour the box factory
% looking for Bart.

Skinner: [to Edna] I'll handle this.  Simpson!  I'm giving you till the
         count of three to come out!  One, two, three!  [pause] I've
         done all I can do.
   Edna: We better call his parents.
  Marge: [Runs dripping from the shower toward the ringing phone]
         Just a minute!  Don't hang up!
          [picks up the phone, but it's dead]
         Mmm...
   Edna: No answer at home; I'll call his father.
  Homer: [Runs with a towel around his waist toward the phone]

         Y'ello?  You'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel.

% Inside the studio, Bart looks around at the hustle and bustle.  He
% wanders past some workmen carrying a tropical beach scene, and in

     Ethan: Action!
Chespirito: [With a lobster on his tail] Ay, ay, ay!  No me gusta!

-- What was that again?, "Bart Gets Famous"

% Krusty is still nervous as he awaits Bart's arrival.

Krusty: Where is that lousy little pisher -- [Bart walks in]
         [joyfully] Bart!  [kisses him]
         [On stage, a fanfare plays]
        And now, boys and girls, here he is, the boy that says the words
        you've been longing to hear, like the salivating dogs that you
        are, Bart Simpson!
-- Did someone ring a bell?, "Bart Gets Famous"

% Bart struts out and says, "I didn't do it."  One woman chuckles, and a
% man clears his throat.  Bart repeats himself, but only the crickets
% chirp.  He looks over at Krusty, but he's no help: he simply shrugs.
% Bart tries another line: "Woozle Wuzzle?"  Everyone repeats it to
% themselves, and a man asks, "That's what passes for entertainment
% these days?  Woozle Wuzzle?"  Everyone gets up to leave, and an
% announcer says, "Ladies and Gentlemen, the Klown Show has been put on
% hiatus for retooling."

  Bart: What happened?
Krusty: Aw, don't worry about that.  You're just finished, that's all.
  Bart: Finished?
Krusty: Ehh, it happens all the time.  That's show business for you: one
        day you're the most important guy that ever lived, the next day
        you're some shmoe working in a box factory.
 Guide: I heard that.
  Bart: Boy.  Show business is kind of cruel, isn't it?
         [Krusty slams and locks the exit, leaving Bart outside]
-- You _could_ say that, yes, "Bart Gets Famous"

% Bart walks home alone.  As he passes a taxi, he hears KBBL.

Marty: That was "Kung Fu Fighting".  Say, speaking of one-trick ponies,
       whatever happened to that "I didn't do it" kid?
 Bill: Boy, did _that_ get old fast.  Whoa!  You know, if you want to
       last in this business, you've gotta stay fresh!
        [a slide-whistle and clown horn play]
-- "Bart Gets Famous"

% At home, Marge hauls up a box of Bart paraphernalia.  She explains she
% saved them for Bart to remind him of the time when he was the whole
% world's special little guy.  Bart thanks her.

    Lisa: And now you can go back to just being you, instead of a one-
          dimensional character with a silly catch-phrase.
   Homer: [breaks a lamp] D'oh!
    Bart: Ay, caramba!
   Marge: Mmm.
  Maggie: [sucks her pacifier]
Flanders: Heidely-ho.
  Barney: [burps]
  Nelson: Ha, ha!
   Burns: Ex-cellent!
           [Everyone looks at Lisa]
    Lisa: [unimpressed] If anyone wants me, I'll be in my room.
