% The closing bars of "Stars and Stripes Forever" fill the Springfield 
% Elementary band room.  Although the students finish at about the 
% same time, Mr. Largo says there's room for improvement, especially 
% since the school has been invited to the county band competition, 
% er, excuse me, the *state* band competition.

Lisa:	I hate to be a killjoy, but do you really think we can win 
	playing "Stars and Stripes Forever?"  It's so beginner 
	band, and we're advanced beginner band.
Ralph:	[stops drawing a picture on his drum]  This is band?
Largo:	Very well, Lisa, what rousing Sousa march would you have 
	us play?
Lisa:	Well, I thought for once we could play a song that wasn't 
	written by Sousa.
Largo:	You mean something ... just arranged by Sousa?
-- Not a man of great vision, "Saddlesore Galactica"

% Lisa pushes for something bolder:  Something, anything, written by 
% someone else.  Milhouse suggests "Camptown Races."  Nelson pushes 
% for "Little Brown Jug."  It's all too much for Largo, who blames 
% Lisa for this rain of "devil music."  A kid who looks like a chip 
% off the old Sinatra block defends her, and Largo finally gives in.

Okay, we'll do a different song.  Who cares?  They all end up sounding 
the same anyway.

% State Fair day arrives, and so do the Simpsons.  Homer decides to 
% take advantage of the veterans' free admission policy.

Homer:		Vietnam veteran.
Gatekeeper:	Do you have a military ID?
Homer:		ID?  Damn Charlie didn't ask for ID when I fought at 
		La Choy, and Chun King.  I saw my best friend's head 
		explode at Margaret Cho.
Marge:		Homer, give him the fifty cents.
Homer:		Why should I?  Did my country give me a parade?  No, 
		man, they spat at me and --
Gatekeeper:	Just go!  [waves him in]
Homer:		Thank you.  This closes the saddest chapter in 
		American history.
-- Yeah, the one where Homer poses as a veteran, "Saddlesore 
   Galactica"

% Inside the fairgrounds, Marge is impressed by the array of goods for 
% sale.  There's Miracle Shears, a pair of scissors strong enough to 
% cut through a car door in one stroke.  Then there's the Drain 
% Bugger, a fierce-looking beetle that eats clogs and emerges as a 
% colorful butterfly.  And what home would be complete without a set 
% of OmniGogs?

OmniGog Man:	Folks, how often have you opened the morning paper 
		only to have the rubber band fly off and hit you 
		right in the eye?
Marge:		Never.  But it's my number one concern.
OmniGog Man:	Well, with the OmniGog system, those worries are a 
		thing of the past.
		[puts on the goggles and rolls the rubber band off 
		the newspaper he's holding.  The rubber band smacks 
		him on the head hard enough to throw him back 
		several feet.  The crowd gasps, but he's quickly 
		back on his feet]
		I'm all right, folks -- thanks to my OmniGogs!
		[the crowd cheers, and the camera focuses on Lenny, 
		who wears a bandage on his right eye]
Lenny:		[ruefully] A little late for Lenny.

% At another corner of the fair, Bachman Turner Overdrive tunes up to 
% play.

Bart:	Who are those pleasant old men?
Homer:	It's BTO -- they're Canada's answer to ELP.  Their big hit 
	was TCB.  [notices Bart staring at him, questioningly]  
	That's how we talked in the 70's.  We didn't have a moment 
	to spare.
-- "Saddlesore Galactica"

% Homer evidently still doesn't have a moment to spare, because he 
% almost immediately requests "Takin' Care of Business."  And not just 
% "Takin' Care of Business," but to a part in the middle of the song.  
% The band can't believe what they're hearing, but they oblige.  As 
% Homer dances in a way that would embarrass most mortals to death, 
% Bart sidles away.
%
% Later in the concert, Homer asks for "You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet," 
% despite the fact that BTO just finished playing it.  There's no time 
% for an encore, though, since the state elementary band competition 
% is about to begin.

Turner:	Be sure to stick around for the battle of the elementary 
	school bands.
Homer:	Ohhh.
Marge:	Homer, Lisa's in that!
Homer:	I stand by my disappointed groan.
-- "Saddlesore Galactica"

% Instead of the traditional Sousa march, the band has decided to play 
% "Living in America."  It's a rousing rendition, indeed, highlighted 
% by Lisa's proficient sax playing.  Even her brother is impressed.

Check out Lisa!  She's a sax machine!
-- Bart, "Saddlesore Galactica"

% Comptroller Atkins, who is emceeing the competition, is similarly 
% impressed, as are Marge and Homer.  Lisa is confident of victory, 
% especially when she hears that the last band in the contest, from 
% Ogdenville, will be playing "Stars and Stripes Forever."
%
% Lisa's certainty is premature.  At the end of their set, the 
% Ogdenville band produces red, white and blue glow sticks, forming a 
% glowing version of the American flag.  The bandmembers even wave the 
% sticks around a little, giving the effect of the flag in a breeze.  
% The crowd is wowed by this razzle-dazzle, and the judges award the 
% prize to Ogdenville, despite the fact that visual aids are against 
% the rules.
%
% Stung by the defeat, Lisa calls one of the Ogdenville children a 
% cheater as he walks by with the winners' plaque.  Unfortunately, 
% Comptroller Atkins overhears the remark, and takes back his decision 
% to award Springfield the trophy for good sportsmanship.

Lisa:	I can't believe those idiot judges were impressed by 
	glowing plastic tubes.
Homer:	[wearing a garland of glow sticks] Look, Lisa!  It glows.  
	[waves one in front of his face, fascinated] Ooooh.
-- Bet you didn't see that one coming, "Saddlesore Galactica"

% Marge says that Lisa should relax and try to enjoy the state fair.  
% (Or state *un*fair, as Lisa insists on calling it.)  She then 
% follows her own advice, walking with Homer and Bart among the 
% display booths.
%
%  Homer's shirt looks a little browner and crisper than usual.

Homer:	See Marge, I told you they could deep-fry my shirt.
Marge:	I didn't say they couldn't, I said you *shouldn't*.

% A carnival barker entices the Simpsons, and many other fairgoers, to 
% step right up and see Duncan, the diving horse.  Duncan, a white 
% horse wearing outsized bathing trunks, stands on a platform high 
% above a pool of water.  (It looks like one of those six-foot above-
% ground models.)  The barker pulls a lever, and the platform begins 
% to tilt.  "Looks like he's ready to dive," says the barker, but to 
% the impartial observer it looks like Duncan is terrified.  He 
% scrambles to stay on the platform, but eventually it angles too 
% steeply, and he falls into the pool below.
%
% "What's that Duncan?  You say you want to dive again?" the barker 
% asks.  A carny attaches a harness, and a crane begins to lift the 
% horse.  Duncan appears resigned to taking another dive, when Wiggum 
% arrives, escorted by Eddie and Lou.

Wiggum:	This is clearly a case of animal cruelty.  Uh, do you have 
	a permit for that?
Barker:	No problem, sir, it's in my car.  [gets in, and quickly 
	drives off]
Lou:	You've gotta stop being so trusting, Chief.
Wiggum:	Ah, I'd rather let a thousand guilty men go free than 
	chase after them.
-- "Saddlesore Galactica"

% The Chief practices some crowd control.

Wiggum:	All right, show's over, folks.  I'm afraid this horse is 
	going to the dog food factory.
Homer:	Good luck getting a horse to eat dog food!
Bart:	You can't do that to Duncan!  It's not his fault that his 
	owner was a sleaze.
Wiggum:	Look, I just want the horse to have a good home, or be 
	food.  You want to take him, fine with me.
	[Duncan looks at Bart.  Bart looks at Duncan, then Homer.  
	Homer looks at Marge.  There's no way this horse is going 
	to the dog food factory]
Marge:	Hmmm.  Should the Simpsons get a horse?
CBG:	Excuse me, I believe this family already had a horse, and 
	the expense forced Homer to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, with 
	hilarious consequences.
Homer:	Anybody care what this guy thinks?
Crowd:	No!
-- Do you think they're trying to tell us something?  "Saddlesore

% Soon, the Simpsons are driving home, with Duncan riding on the roof.  
% Homer warns him of a tunnel, so Duncan can duck in time.

% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:45]
%
% As had happened in "Lisa's Pony (8F06)," the Simpsons must confront 
% the challenge of paying for Duncan's upkeep.  While Marge bought 
% quite a pile of gewgaws at the fair, the only thing she has to feed 
% is the mop.  The tab for keeping Duncan, on the other hand, will be 
% US$500 a week.  Fortunately, Homer has devised a way for Duncan to 
% earn his keep.
%
% Duncan, wearing an old-fashioned leather football helmet, Homer, and 
% Bart are at the school's football field.  Duncan runs up, and kicks 
% a football for a picture-perfect field goal.

Homer:	[impressed] Hmmm, that's terrific, Duncan.  You're ten for 
	ten.  Now let's look in the rulebook and see if horses can 
	play in the NFL.  [thumbs through a book] D'oh!
Bart:	He's a diving horse.  Maybe he could dive for pearls.
Homer:	Pearls, eh?
	[Homer daydreams of drifting through the sky, laying on a 
	fanciful bed made of pearls.  A pearl-shaped butler walks 
	up]
Butler:	Breakfast is served.
	[he gives Homer a bowl of Pearl-Os.  Homer digs in, and 
	reaches for a hand mirror.  His teeth have all been broken 
	off into jagged points.  Surprisingly, Homer doesn't mind, 
	and breaks out into a giggle fit]
	[in real life, he rolls laughing on the ground.  Bart 
	rides over on Duncan]
Bart:	Hey, Dad!
Homer:	Huh?
Bart:	This horse is pretty fast.  Maybe we can race him.
Homer:	Racehorse, eh?
	[resumes giggling]
-- "Saddlesore Galactica"

% Back home, Lisa writes a letter to President Clinton, decrying the 
% outcome of the band contest.  Marge advises her to stop obsessing 
% over that, and concentrate on life's good things.  As an example, 
% she shows Lisa how well a fire extinguisher she bought at the fair 
% works.  It should work:  It's the only extinguisher with 
% endorsements from Lynda Carter and George Foreman.  Marge wonders 
% what it would be like if the two were to have a child together and 
% rolls, Homer-like, on the floor laughing at the imagined result.
%
% Homer and Bart prepare Duncan for his first race.

Bart:	Dad, if we're going to race Duncan, shouldn't we hire a 
	professional trainer?
Homer:	Son, I learned everything I needed to know from "The Horse 
	Whisperer."  Step one:  Seduce a lonely housewife.  [turns 
	to the Flanders house, where Maude happens to be looking 
	through one of the windows]  Ma'am.  [she lowers the 
	blinds]  Now for the actual horse whispering.
	[whispers into Duncan's ear]
	When the race starts, run really fast.

% Meanwhile, the jockeys warm up their horses.

Jockey 1:	Just once, I'd like to ride clockwise.
Jockey 2:	Really?  I thought I was the only one.

% A blast from an air horn signals Homer's arrival.  With Bart riding 
% jockey in his Krusty pajamas, Homer leads Duncan into the ring.  He 
% gives the horse a taco, with the promise of another one when he 
% wins.  But first, some last-minute preparations.

		dealies for his feet?
Jockey 2:	You mean, horseshoes?
Homer:		Hey, what's with the attitude?  I just wanted some 
		dealies.

		half?
Homer:		He ran all the way here.

% A horn fanfare signals that it's time to get the horses to the 
% starting line.  Homer looks at the odds for Duncan, and he's a 
% longshot:  5,000,000:1.

Homer:	That horse better win, or we're taking a trip to the glue

-- Homer Simpson, "Saddlesore Galactica"

% Bart says that Duncan's problem is that he's intimidated by the

%
% Meanwhile, Lisa still can't let the band contest go, and has called

% Marge walks by, hangs up the phone for Lisa, and advises her to 
% channel her energies into something more useful.  Their talk is

% only his mane is how a wild rainbow of colors peeking out from under 
% a purple beret, and he sports a big gold nose ring.  His fierce 
% scowl reveals a gold tooth.  Not quite believing their eyes, Marge 
% and Lisa run outside to see Duncan's new persona.

Lisa:	Is that Duncan?
Homer:	Not anymore.  Ladies, say hello to ...
Marge:	[reading the name printed on his flank] Furious D?
Bart:	He's the bad boy of racing.  He's got attitude and bad-
	itude.  So show him some latitude and you'll win his 
	gratitude.  Only in America!
Lisa:	Ew, you used my bracelet for a nose ring.
Homer:	[mystical] Possessions are fleeting.
-- How Zen, "Saddlesore Galactica"

% Furious D makes his debut at Springfield Downs, and his half-savage 
% appearance (and Bart's "get bent") horrify an aristocratic couple.
%
% At the betting windows, Marge tries to bet that all the horses will 
% have a fun time.  The impatient clerk directs her to the "Wuss Bets" 
% window.
%
% The other jockeys aren't impressed with Furious D, and mock him in

% looks ready to win.  The race begins.
%
% In the stands ...

% Homer is exultant over Duncan's victory, and there's more to come.  
% Duncan is so far ahead in one race he crosses the line backwards and 
% taunts the other horses.  In another contest, he whirls around and 
% stares the other horses down until they meekly go back to the 
% starting gate.  Even when he loses, he wins.  After one race, he 
% butts the winning horse out of the winners' circle.  Not knowing 
% what else to do, the judges give the winning wreath to Duncan.
%
% Homer is still basking in the glory of having more trophies than 
% hockey great Wayne Gretsky and religion great the Pope, when one of 
% the jockeys invites him into the jockeys' lounge for a beer.  When 
% he steps inside, there's nobody around.  A door opens, and a jockey 
% grabs Homer by the ankles and drags him to a chute.  Homer tumbles 
% down and lands in a storybook garden, assuming the story was written
