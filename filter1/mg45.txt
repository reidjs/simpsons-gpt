% The kitchen.  The cookie jar is open, crumbs all over.
% Homer dries the dishes while Marge wipes down the table with her
% eyes closed.  She opens her eyes, spots the jar, and slaps her forehead.

M: Hey!  There's only one cookie left!

% And she's right.  At the bottom of the jar sits one lonely cookie.
%
% Homer (dressed in a pink frilly apron) angrily addresses the two girls.

H: All right, who swiped the rest of them!

% Lisa throws open her arms.

L: Don't look at us, Dad!

% Maggie sucks in agreement.
%
% Quick cut to Bart's room.  Bart moans in pain as we pan across Bart's
% crumb-covered stomach.  Bart belches as the pan continues to his face,
% his mouth and shirt covered in crumbs.

B: Why'd I eat all those cookies?

% Dissolve into a swirling vortex into which cookies descend.  Bart hovers
% in his bed, shivering.  Homer's ominous head appears, chasing Bart (and his
% bed) to the other side of the vortex.

H: Lay off those cookies, boy!

% Homer vanishes, replaced by Marge at the other end.  Bart's bed slides
% around to make room.

M: That jar is off-limits, Bart.  And if I catch you with so much as
   one cookie...

% Next up is Lisa.

L: Mom!  Dad!  Bart's eating cookies!

% And Maggie.

A: (*suck*)  (*suck*)  (*suck*)  (*suck*)  (*suck*)!

% Bart falls out of his bed...
%
% ... and lands in a giant-sized kitchen.  (Bart is only an inch tall.)
% Bart is drawn against his will towards the cookie jar...

B: No!  No!  No!

% But too late.  The cookie jar teeters and falls, crashing over Bart's
% head, sending ceramic shards (and cookies) across the kitchen floor.
% Homer's shadow is cast across the floor.

H: Why you little...
B: I didn't do it!  I didn't do it!  I didn't do it!

% Dissolve to Bart's bedroom, where Homer tries to wake Bart from his
% nightmare.

B: I didn't do it...  I didn't do it...
H: Wake up, Bart!
B: Ohhhhh...
H: Come on, snap out of it, boy!

% Lisa slaps Bart.

B: Huh?
L: You were only having a nightmare, Bart.
B: Ohhhhh...
H: Yeah, boy.  Everything's going to be okay.

% The rest of the family lean in to check up on Bart.

M: It was all a dream.

% Homer holds out a chocolate-chip cookie.

H: Here, Bart.  Have a cookie!
B: Wauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh!
