 Marge: We're all aware of Grampa's problems, but compared to Mr. Burns,
        he's Judge freaking Reinhold!
Jackie: [pause] I don't know who that is.
-- A lost comparison, "Lady Bouvier's Lover"

% Abe wanders down the street, trying to console himself.

Abe: Aw, who needs her?  Now I'll have more time to read things I find
     on the ground.  [picks something up] "La...tex...con...do"...boy,
     I'd like to live in one of those!
-- I don't think so, "Lady Bouvier's Lover"

% Just then he spies Jackie trying on her wedding dress in a bridal
% salon, and he runs off.
%
% It's wedding day at the First Church of Springfield.  When Barney
% arrives, Homer suggests he sit on the groom's side since the bride's
% side is packed.  Barney screams "Down in front" at the only other
% person.  The man (who wears a Kaiser helmet) shouts back, "Nein!"
%
% The bridal chorus plays.  Lisa the flower girl and Bart the ring-
% bearer walk down the aisle together.

Lisa: Where's Grampa?  Wasn't he invited?
Bart: Yeah, but his reply envelope just had a check to the gas company
      in it.
-- The perils of age, "Lady Bouvier's Lover"

% Marge and Smithers walk down the aisle, scowling, followed by Homer
% and Selma.  Rev. Lovejoy reads a passage from the bible.

Lovejoy: And so when Eliphaz came down from Mount Hebron bearing figs,
         he offered them to Mohem, who you will remember is the father
         of Sheckhom, and to Hazar on the occasion of their matrimony,
         much in the same --
  Burns: We've heard enough about Bliz-Blaz and Him-Ham already.  Get to
         the bloody point!
          [Marge elbows Jackie, "Hmm?  Hmm?"]
Lovejoy: Do you, Charles Montgomery Burns, take this woman to be your
         lawfully wedded wife?
  Burns: I do.
          [Bart bumbles with the ring and drops it]
         The ring, you little imbecile, before I really lose my temper!
          [kicks Bart.  Marge elbows Jackie]
 Jackie: I know, I know.  Ow!  Ow!  [Burns forces the ring on]
          [Marge scowls]
Lovejoy: Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier, take this man to be your lawfully
         wedding husband?
          ["Moonlight Serenade" starts on the organ]
 Jackie: Oh, Monty, my favorite song!  How did --
  Burns: I specifically requested _no_ romantic music!  What --
-- A real charmer, "Lady Bouvier's Lover"

% From the organist's booth, Abe calls out, "Mrs. Bouvier!" as he pounds
% on the window.  Glass breaks and Abe falls to the floor face first.

   Abe: Honey!  Are you sure you want to be Mrs. Montgomery Burns?
        Wouldn't you rather be Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?
Jackie: No!
   Abe: [gulps] [Burns grins]
Jackie: I don't want to be either!
   Abe: Hot ziggety zam!  That's good enough for me!
         [skips down the aisle with her, arm in arm, and onto the bus to
        the retirement home]
         [guitar music plays]
   Abe: Turn off that racket!
  Otto: Yeah, fat chance, Pops.
-- Otto, always the sympathetic one, "Lady Bouvier's Lover"

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:15]

% Over the credits, a duo sings over "The Sound of Silence":
% 
% Hello Grampa, my old friend,
% Your busy day is at an end.
% Your exploits have been sad and boring,
% They tell a tale that's worth ignoring.
% When you're alone, the words of your story
% Will echo down the rest-home hall,
% [in syndication, the screen divides here {rl}]
% {'Cause no one at all can stand
% The sound of Grampa.}
% 
% Abe begins to tell a story, "{I first took a fancy to Mrs. Bouvier
% because her raspy voice} reminded me of my old Victrola.  Oh, it was a
% fine machine with a vulcanized rubber listening tube which you crammed
% in your ear.  The tube would go in easier with some sort of lubricant
% like linseed oil or Dr. --", but he's interrupted by the "Shh!" of the
% "Gracie Films" woman.  "Oh, I'm sorry," he apologizes.
