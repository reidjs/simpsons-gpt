         come back?
Skinner: Ehh, I must admit, I do miss the school.  And frankly, the army
         isn't _quite_ as I remembered it --
          [some recruits drive by in a tank.  One moons Skinner, another
         swears at him, another tosses a beer can at him]
         Actually, it's _exactly_ as I remembered it.
-- The more things change..., "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"

Skinner: I do want to come back, but it doesn't sound like Flanders is
         going to get fired.
   Bart: Oh, I think I could get him fired.  I got you fired, didn't I?
         [laughs]
Skinner: [unimpressed] Yes.
-- A painful memory, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"

% Skinner points out that their friendship will have to end if Skinner
% comes back as principal -- unless Bart becomes a good student.  Bart
% doesn't think that's likely, and Skinner agrees, but says, "We'll
% always have the laundromat."
%
% Bart has invited Skinner over to discuss the plans for Ned's
% dishonorable discharge.

          [Skinner walks in, sees Homer]
 Skinner: What's _he_ doing here?
    Bart: Well once he found out we were going to get Ned Flanders
          fired, he _insisted_ on helping.
   Homer: That is true.
    Bart: Here's the plan: once Chalmers comes for his next inspection
          and sees how crappy the school has gotten, he'll fire Ned on
          the spot.
 Skinner: Er, one question remains: how do I get out of the army?
    Bart: No problemo.  Just make a pass at your commanding officer!
 Skinner: Done and done.  And I mean done.
   Marge: [outside] What's going on in there?
Everyone: Nothing...
-- No, really, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"

% In Bart's classroom, Martin does someone's ironing in his suspended
% cage while singing, "Toreador en garde..." Bart shows Chalmers the
% deplorable state the school has fallen into.

    Bart: Come on, Chalmie, you fired Skinner for less than this.
Chalmers: Yeah, I did, but...Skinner really bugged me!  Besides, the way
          America's public schools are sliding, they'll all be this way
          in a few months.  I say, lay back and enjoy it!  It's a hell
          of a toboggan ride.
     Ned: [over PA] Well, cockly-doodly-doo, little buddies.  Let's
          thank the Lord for another beautiful school day.
Chalmers: Thank the Lor -- thank the Lord?  That sounded like a prayer.
          A prayer.  A prayer in a public school!  God has no place
          within these walls, just like facts have no place within
          organized religion.  Simpson, you get your wish: Flanders is
          history!
           [scene change to Willy cleaning graffiti off the lockers]
     Ned: Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent.  May the
          Lord bless and keep you.
Chalmers: Yeah, take it outside, God-boy.
     Ned: Okily dokily.
 Skinner: Dirksen, tuck in your shirt.  Jaffee, spit out that gum!
 Leopold: You really think it's a good idea to give that _freak_ his job
          back?
Chalmers: Aw, he seems to know the students' names.
-- A compelling reason, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"

% Bart and Skinner stand alone in the hall.  "So...I guess we're enemies
% again," observes Bart.  Skinner agrees, and thanks Bart.  The two of
% them hug, and as Skinner walks away, Bart chuckling at the "KICK ME"
% sign on his back.  Skinner turns back to laugh at the "TEACH ME" sign
% on Bart's back.  "Oh, Mercy," he grins.
