% Dr. Hibbert delivers a speech at the opening of the Springfield Center
% for Geriatric Medicine.

Hibbert: Er, welcome to the new Springfield Center for Geriatric
         Medicine.  You know, health care for the aging is an important
         priority in this --
    Abe: Get to Matlock!  Maaatlooock!
Hibbert: Well, uh, ahem, without further ado, heh heh, I give you the
         man who puts young people behind bars -- where they belong.
         TV's Matlock!
          [An old man with two canes walks slowly onto the stage]
  Crowd: [singing] We love you Matlock, oh yes we do...
-- Matlock: Hero of the Aged, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% In their excitement, the crowd turns violent and rushes the stage,
% knocking poor Matlock over and tugging cruelly at his collar, tearing
% it.  Someone even puts their cane around his throat.
%
% On the way back to the Springfield Retirement Castle, Abe seems quiet.

Jasper: What's eatin' you, Abe?  For three weeks all you've been talking
        about is meeting Matlock.  Now you've met him, swiped his pills
        -- [reads label] "Take one every hour to prevent spastic heart
        convulsions" --
         [An ambulance drives by with its siren blaring; inside a doctor
        uses cardiac stimulator, yelling "Clear!"]
        -- but you ain't said a word.
   Abe: Looking at that tired old freak has made me realize I'm no
        spring chicken myself.  I can feel death's clammy hand on my
        shoulder...wait, that's my hand.
-- "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% In the next scene, the Simpson family is seated in front of Grampa at
% their house.

 Abe: Hello.  As you may know, I might not be around much longer.  So,
      I've decided to give you your inheritance before I die.  That way
      I can see you enjoy it.
      Lisa, I know you like reading and...so forth.  To you, I give you
      my lifetime of personal correspondence.
Lisa: Thanks.  [reads] "Mr. Simpson stop Your calls and letters are

  Abe: And to my son Homer --
Homer: Woo-hoo!
  Abe: -- and his entire family --
Homer: D'oh!
  Abe: -- I leave these: a box of mint-condition 1918 liberty-head
       silver dollars.  You see, back in those days, rich men would ride
       around in Zeppelins, dropping coins on people, and one day I seen
       J. D. Rockefeller flying by.  So I run of the house with a big
       washtub and -- [notices everyone ready to leave] where are you
       going?
Homer: Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidote,
       but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend 'em!
-- Priority one, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% Abe's pointless story continues in the car ride to the mall.

Abe: Anyway, about my washtub...I just used it that morning to wash my
     turkey, which in those days was known as a "walking bird".  We'd
     always have walking bird on Thanksgiving with all the trimmings:
     cranberries, injun eyes, yams stuffed with gunpowder.  Then we'd
     all watch football, which in those days was called "baseball"...
-- Onions for everyone's belt, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% They go to a toy store in the mall, and Maggie resourcefully uses an
% Etch-A-Sketch[tm] to write her name.  Homer walks over and
% uncerimoniously puts another toy on top of the Etch-A-Sketch.

Homer: Look, Maggie!  It's Sergeant Thug's Mountaintop Command Post!
       Complete with "DeathBringer Missiles" that really launch.
Marge: Mmm...that toy isn't safe for a baby like Maggie!
Homer: Aw, come on, Marge, you're way too -- [cuts his finger on it]
       D'oh!  Aw -- [gets electrocuted] Aah!  [launches a missile into
       his mouth] ooh -- [it explodes]
-- A closed mouth gathers no feet, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% Abe, meanwhile, inspects some of the other merchandise.

  Abe: When I was young, toys were built to last.  Look at this junk!
       [holds a toy rocket] It breaks the first time you take it out of
       the box.
        [He strains, then manages to break it in half]
       And look at these toy soldiers -- they'll break the second I step
       on 'em.  [stomps on em] Arg!  Stupid!  Toy!  Soldiers!  Break,
       you stupid --
        [Two security guards grab him]
Guard: All right, come on, Pops.  Soldiers won't bother you any more.

% steps on another key, and then gets an idea.}
%
% {"One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, rock!  Five, six, seven
% o'clock, eight o'clock, rock!  Rock, rock, rock --" he sings off-key,
% at first playing the right notes, then jumping around randomly.  A
% crowd gathers and begins to protest while Homer does the front crawl
% down the keys.  All the dogs in a nearby pet store begin howling in
% pain.  "We're gonna rock around a rock, around the clock toniiight!"
% Homer finishes, sliding down the keys on his knees and cracking a hole
% through them.  Everyone boos him, and he stands up: "Thank you, thank
% you very much!"}

% Marge and Lisa turn the corner to see a crowd of excited little girls
% in front of a Malibu Stacy display.  They gasp together.

 Lisa: I warning you, Mom: I may get a little crazy.

-- Passing doll fads, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% The two girls go up to an employee who pulls a trolley with a large

Bart: [plays with Sergeant Thug's Mountaintop Command Post, making plane

 Abe: Hey, watch it with that thing!  [a missile launches out the
      window] My skull is eggshell-thin.

Bart: Cool!
Lisa: Thanks for buying us these toys, Grampa.
 Abe: Ehh, why didn't you get something useful, like storm windows, or a
      nice pipe organ?  I'm thirsty!  Ew, what smells like mustard?
      There're sure a lot of ugly people in your neighborhood.  Oh!
      Look at that one.
       [Homer turns into the driveway; everyone jumps out except Abe]
      Ow, my glaucoma just got worse.  The president is a Demmycrat.

-- The challenge of aged parents, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% Abe manages to unbuckle it eventually, and he walks in the house
% proclaiming "There are too many leaves in your walkway."  He's greeted
% by doors slamming all around.  Disgruntled, he sits down to watch TV.
% In the background, Homer grabs a Buzz Cola and tries to sneak past
% Grampa, but his foot gets caught in the phone cord and he surprises
% Abe.

      Abe: Why are you people avoiding me?  Does my withered face remind
           you of the grim specter of Death?
    Homer: [pause] Yes, but there's more.  [sits down on the couch]
           Dad, I love you, but -- [angry] you're a weird, sore-headed
           old crank and nobody likes you!

  Old man: One sip and I'm totally hip!
Announcer: Buzz Cola.  There's a little boogie in every bottle.

           and lookin' young, and I'm gonna start with a bottle of Buzz
           Cola.
            [Grabs it from Homer, starts to chug]

-- It was the thought that counted, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

Stacy: I wish they taught shopping in school!
 Lisa: [groans, pulls Stacy's cord again]
Stacy: Let's bake some cookies for the boys!
 Lisa: Come on, Stacy.  I've waited my whole life to hear you speak.
       Don't you have anything relevant to say?  [pulls cord]
Stacy: Don't ask me, I'm just a girl.  [giggles coquettishly]
 Bart: Right on!  Say it, sister.
 Lisa: It's not funny, Bart.  Millions of girls will grow up thinking
       that this is the right way to act -- that they can never be more
       than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a
       rich husband, and spend all day on the phone with their equally
       vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look
       pretty and have a rich husband!
 Bart: [pause] Just what I was going to say.
-- Shyeah, right, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% Lisa growls and tosses Stacy away in a fit of pique.  Outside, Abe
% rides a bicycle with no hands, proclaiming, "Look at me!  I'm acting
% young!"  Stacy flies from the house and hits Abe's front tire, sending
% him flying.  He lands in a half-dug grave.  The two diggers, who were
% eating their lunch, look back at the dig.  "Hey," observes Abe, "this
% ain't so bad."

% At school, Lisa and all her friends play with their new Talking Malibu
% Stacy dolls.

  Stacy: Let's buy makeup so the boys will like us.
   Lisa: [sighs] Don't you people see anything wrong what Malibu Stacy
         says?
Celeste: There's something wrong with what _my_ Stacy says.
  Stacy: [in a low voice] My spidey sense is tingling -- anybody call
         for a web-slinger?
   Lisa: No, Celeste.  I mean, the things she says are sexist.
  Girls: [giggle] Lisa said a dirty word!
-- Ah, to be eight again, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% At home that night, the family chows down on dinner, but Lisa's is
% untouched.  She stares angrily at the doll she holds in front of her.

 Lisa: They _cannot_ keep making dolls like this...something has to be
       done!
        [Chewing stops slowly; Homer swallows noisily]
Marge: Lisa, ordinarily I'd say you should stand up for what you believe
       in.  But you've been doing that an awful lot lately!
 Bart: Yeah.  You made us march in that gay rights parade!
        [Holds up newspaper showing gay parade with Bart prominently in

Homer: And we can't watch Fox because they own those chemical weapon
       plants in Syria.
 Lisa: I can't believe you're just going to stand by as your daughters
       grow up in a world where this, _this_, is their role model.
Marge: I had a Malibu Stacy when I was little and I turned out all
       right.  Now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of
       strawberry ice cream!
Stacy: Now low let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry

          doll that was also edible.
          Kids didn't much like the taste of dried onion meal, but they
          _loved_ the doll.  A second, plastic Malibu Stacy took America

           the door, laughs evilly, and drives off]
     Lisa: Dad, did you hear something?
    Homer: [dumb voice] I-unno.
-- Oh, no, not the brick, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% Kent Brockman's daughter has bought a Lisa Lionheart doll already. and
% she shows it happily to her father.

Daughter: Dad?
    Kent: Uh huh?
Daughter: My new doll is much better than Malibu Stacy.  Do a newscast
          about her.
    Kent: Ho ho, please, honey, Daddy's job is to bring people important
          news.  Right now I'm busy preparing a report about the
          fortieth anniversary of Beetle Bailey.
Daughter: Oh, Daddy, that is boring.  Talk about the dolly!
    Kent: [considers] Well, you were right about the Berlin Wall...
-- Who needs an AP wire?, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% Kent Brockman is true to his word.

Though it was unusual to spend 28 minutes reporting on a doll, this
reporter found it impossible to stop talking.  It's just really
fascinating news, folks.  Good night!
 [Music starts playing and credits roll]
Oh, and the President was arrested for murder.  More on that tomorrow
night, or you can turn to another channel.
 [Looks off to the side]
Oh.  Do not turn to another channel.
-- Kent Brockman, intrepid reporter, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% The execs at Malibu Stacy watch his newscast too.

Executive: Our one effort to put a stop to this Lisa Lionheart thing has
           failed miserably.  Gentlemen, we have to reinvent Malibu
           Stacy for the nineties.  [ominous] We'll stay here all night
           if need be.
      Man: Can we order Chinese food?
Executive: [pause] Yes.
            [Everyone starts talking excitedly]
-- Great motivators, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% Meanwhile, Abe fields complaints from all the old people eating at the
% Krusty Burger.

Jasper: I cut my tongue on these pancakes.
 Woman: These eggs are difficult to digest.  I want soft-boiled eggs!
   Abe: I told you, we don't have soft-boiled eggs!  If you want -- by
        gum, you're right!  We should have 'em.  I shouldn't be
        listening to complaints; I should be making them with you guys!
        The good Lord lets us grow old for a reason: to gain the wisdom
        to find fault with everything He's made.
        Mr. Peterson, you can take this job and...fill it.  And one more
        thing -- I never once washed my hands.  That's your policy, not
        mine.
-- Abe fesses up, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% The old people all yell their encouragement, then they carry Abe off
% on their shoulders like the hero he is.  But they only get about five
% feet before their weak legs and backs buckle.
%
% A crowd of little girls wait anxiously for the opening of the toy
% store so they can be the first to get Lisa Lionheart.  Smithers waits
% with them, too, greedily anticipating the joy.  When the doors are
% opened, the crowd stampedes in.  "Look," cries one girl, "it's Lisa
% Lionheart!"  Another encourages them, "Keep running!  We're almost
% there!"
%
% They almost make it, except an employee pulls a cart full of Malibu
% Stacy dolls "with NEW hat" in their path.  They all stop: "They
% changed Malibu Stacy!" one exclaims.  "She is better than ever!" says
% another.  Lisa tries to point out that the only difference is her
% stupid cheap hat.  "She still embodies all the awful stereotypes she
% did before!"  Smithers is quick to point out, "But she's got a new
% hat."  This is all it takes for the girls to ignore Lisa Lionheart in
% favor of the cheap-hatted dolls.

 Lisa: [sigh] Well, I guess you can't beat big business.  There's just
       no room for the little guy.
 Lisa: [the doll] Trust in yourself, and you can achieve anything!
        [another girl plays with Lisa Lionheart and smiles]
 Lisa: You know, if we get through to just that one little girl, it'll
       all be worth it!
Stacy: Yes.  Particularly if that little girl happens to pay $46,000 for
       that doll.
 Lisa: What?
Stacy: Oh, nothing.
-- Financial loss but emotional gain, "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"

% Stacy offers Lisa kudos.  They are about to leave the store when Homer
% glances back.  "Marge, Lisa, Lady," he begins, "if you'll excuse me
% I've got something very important to attend to."  He runs back to the
% giant keyboard on the floor and plays the theme to the Simpsons.
% Three employees rush over and try to remove him, and they succeed, but
% not before smashing it once again.
