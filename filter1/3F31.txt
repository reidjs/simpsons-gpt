Troy: "The Simpsons" began as the brainchild of cartoonist Matt
      Groening,
       [screen shows a bald man with an eyepatch saluting in front of a
      US flag and looking menacing]
      the already-famous creator of such comics as "Damnation", "Johnny
      Reb", and "True Murder Stories".  [screen shows each]
      In 1987, Groening teamed up with award-winning producers James L.
      Brooks
       [shot of 8F01-esque rich man surrounded by bags of money]
      and Sam Simon.
       [shot of Howard Hughes-esque naked man typing in bed]
      And what better place to premiere their creation than on "The
      Tracy Ullman Show", the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes
      and musical comedy numbers?  On April 19th, 1987, America first
      met "The Simpsons".
