%
% Maggie is locked in her playpen in the yard.  Pull back to reveal Bart
% and Lisa sitting in chairs, their heads buried in comic books.  At Bart's
% feet lies his skateboard.  Marge is in the car (which is in the driveway).
%
% Homer emerges from the garage.

H: Bart, Lisa.  Keep an eye on Maggie.

% Bart and Lisa wave good-bye, not even looking up.

% The car zooms off.
%
% In her playpen, Maggie bounces an orange ball, which bounces out of the
% pen, landing at Lisa's feet.  Lisa turns the page of her comic book.
% Magge rattles her cup against the bars to get Lisa's attention, and Lisa
% kicks the ball back into the pen.
%
% Maggie bounces the ball, but it escapes a second time, this time hitting
% Bart on the head.  He angrily glares at Maggie, who gestures, ``Gimme.''
% Rather than returning the ball, Bart kicks it over the fence.  Maggie
% watches it sail away.  With a flurry of arms, Maggie piles up her toys,
% hops atop the pile, which recoils like a spring, launching her out of
% the playpen.  She lands on Bart's skateboard and sails away.
%
% Maggie deftly skateboards down the sidewalk in pursuit of the ball,
% following it into a drainpipe.  Through the drainpipe she goes.
%
% The ball emerges from the drainpipe as it empties into a river, and
% Maggie rides the skateboard like a surfboard in pursuit.  The river
% empties into a polluted lake.  Maggie paddles the skateboard like
% a surfboard on her stomach, as she slowly nears the orange ball floating
% a few feet in front of her.  As she passes, she reaches for it, but
% misses.  She then looks ahead...
%
% A waterfall.  As she goes over, Maggie succeeds in grabbing a nearby
% branch with her right hand, holding the skateboard under her left
% arm.  (The branch bends under her weight, then springs back into shape.)
% She sees the ball coming and hooks her pacifier onto the branch, thereby
% freeing her right hand to grab the ball as it tips over the waterfall.
%
% The branch breaks.
%
% Maggie falls headfirst, the ball in her right hand, the skateboard in
% her left, the pacifier in her mouth, sucking furiously.
%
% Freeze-frame.
%
% A huge dramatic title overlays the frame as ominous music plays...
