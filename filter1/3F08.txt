Wiggum: All right Bob, it's over!  Come out with your hands up.
   Bob: No!  How did they find me?
         [electronic sign on side blimp flashes, "HELP!  SIDESHOW BOB IS
        INSIDE!  HIS BOMB WAS A DUD.  THANK YOU.  LISA SIMPSON."]
-- A certain plucky eight-year-old, is how, "Sideshow Bob's Last
    Gleaming"

% Sideshow Bob cuts through the side of the blimp which deflates.  He
% grabs Bart and heads for the Harrier.

    Lisa: He's getting away!  [gets covered by the blimp]
Hapablap: Oh...not the Harrier!  We've got a war tomorrow.
     Bob: [sees control panel with two buttons, STOP and FLY]
          God bless the idiot-proof Air Force.
-- Oh, he'll bless them, all right, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% He presses the FLY button, and the jet taxis forward into a ditch.
% Sideshow Bob switches to the Wright Brothers plane.

   Guard: They're gone!
Hapablap: Hell...not the Wright Brothers plane!  The Smithsonian's gonna
          have my ass on a platter.
-- Bob makes his escape, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% Cut to Homer breaking the entry gate down with his car.  Sideshow Bob
% and Bart fly over head as Lisa runs out.

 Bart: Dad!  Help!
Marge: [screams] Ahh!
Homer: Hang on, Boy!  Daddy's coming to save you!
        [rolls over the tire trap and blows all the tires]
       D'oh!
 Lisa: Mom!  I found Sideshow Bob's hideout and I got a secret message
       to the police and I had a blimp fall on me and I was in an atomic
       blast but I'm OK now!
Homer: Well, I wrecked the gate, but you don't hear me bragging.  Now
       let's roll!
-- How easily the young thrill, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% Cut to Sideshow Bob and Bart in the plane.

 Bob: Aah, for the days when aviation was a gentleman's pursuit -- back
      before every Joe Sweatsock could wedge himself behind a lunch tray
      and jet off to Raleigh-Durham.
Bart: [spitting] Are you getting lots of bugs in your mouth too?
 Bob: [pause] Yes.  [spits]
-- Ew, bugs, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% Two jets speed in.

Intercom: Prepare to engage enemy.
           [the jets speed past]
          Bogey's air speed not sufficient for intercept.  Suggest we
          get out and walk.
-- The air force guys in hot pursuit, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% The two pilots do just that.  Homer drives behind the plane.  "Jump,
% Boy!  I've got you!" he cries.  "I'm coming!" yells Bart.  He breaks
% away from Sideshow Bob.  He throws his backpack to Homer, which falls
% beneath the car's wheels and then explodes.

Homer: Now you Boy!
 Bart: [scared] Oh.
        [plane approaches cops standing on their cars]
       You can't escape Bob.  If the tennis rackets don't get you, the
       pool skimmers will.
  Bob: Ooh, I never planned to escape.  You see, this is a kamikaze
       mission!  You and I are going to kill Krusty the Clown!  Hah hah
       hah!
-- The final diabolical plan revealed, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% Bob manages to avoid both the tennis rackets and pool skimmers.  Cut
% to Krusty in the civil defense shed.

Krusty: Kids...Itchy and Scratchy can't be here today.  But instead,
        we've got the next best thing!  It's the Stingy and Battery
        show!  They bite.  And light.  And bite and light and...yatta,
        yatta, you know what I'm talking about.
  Bart: You can't kill Krusty: he made you what you are.  Without him,
        you wouldn't even be called Sideshow!
   Bob: Grrrr.
Krusty: [hears noise, stops singing] What the hell is that, a lawnmower?
         [looks out window, sees plane]
        Yiaaah!
  Bart: Get out of the way, Krusty!
-- Portrait of a clown's mortality, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% Krusty jumps through the window.  The plane takes awhile to get there.

Krusty: What is the freaking holdup?
   Bob: Die, Krusty, Die!
-- Slow-motion kamikaze, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% The plane hits the shed and bounces off of it, knocking Sideshow Bob
% and Bart to the ground.  A tank rolls in and then over the plane,
% crushing it.

 Soldier: Ooh, sorry.  We don't normally drive these in the Air Force.
  Wiggum: [cuffing Bob] Got ya, ha ha, you...TV-hating mutant!
Hapablap: What is your major malfunction, Sideshow Bob?
   Marge: [kisses Bart] My little sugar bug!  [kisses] I'm so glad
          you're safe!
    Bart: But -- but -- but -- Mom!  You're embarrassing me in front of
          the Army guys!
     Bob: How ironic.  My crusade against television has come to end so
          formulaic, it could have spewed from the PowerBook of the
          laziest Hollywood hack.
-- _Could_ have..., "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% Grampa pulls up to the shed on a chopped motorcycle.

Grampa: Hey everybody, I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza!
Family: Here we go again!
