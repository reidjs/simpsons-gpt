% It's a beautiful day in Springfield, and Waylon Smithers comes out of
% his house.

[to the tune of "Hooray for Hollywood"]
I work for Monty Burns,
Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh Monty Burns.
-- What keeps Waylon Smithers alive, "You Only Move Twice"

% As he merrily hums on his walk to work, a limousine slows down to his
% pace and a woman offers him a ride -- which he kindly refuses.
% Nonetheless, she explains to him that Globex Corporation would be
% interested in hiring him, offering an impressive salary plus health
% benefit for him and his "life partner". Smithers gets annoyed.

What's wrong with this country? Can't a man walk down the street without
being offered a job?
-- Smithers' view of America, "You Only Move Twice"

% With Smithers out of question, Globex chooses the next most senior
% employee, which happens to be... Homer. He explains the whole deal to
% Marge, but the job requires them to move to Cypress Creek.

Marge: You took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with
       your family?
Homer: Of course not. I wouldn't do that!  [pause]  Why not?
Marge: We have roots here, Homer. We have friends and family and library
       cards... Bart's lawyer is here.
-- All the essential commodities, "You Only Move Twice"

Homer: But, Marge, this is a chance for me to fulfil my lifelong dream.
Marge: *What* lifelong dream?
-- Just pick one from the list, "You Only Move Twice"

Homer: Promise not to laugh? I always wanted to own the Dallas Cowboys.
        [Bart and Lisa laugh]
 Lisa: I'm sorry, Dad. I just find that very cute.
-- "You Only Move Twice"

% But Marge isn't happy at all with the idea of leaving her town.

Marge: I've dug myself into a happy little rut here and I'm not about to
       hoist myself out of it.
Homer: Just bring the rut with ya, Honey.
-- "You Only Move Twice"

% Homer doesn't give up, and loads a promotional video in the VCR.

   TV: "Cypress Creek: The Tale of One City".
Homer: Uh, let's watch something else.
Marge: Homer, you're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
Homer: Oh, yeah, that's right. Let's watch this.
-- The power of conviction, "You Only Move Twice"

% The promotional video is as crappy as you could imagine, picturing an
% ugly suburb, plagued with criminality, which turns into the perfect
% community; parking meters become trees, abandoned warehouses become
% coffee shops, and a bum becomes a mailbox.

Announcer #1: Cypress Creek: where dreams come true.
Announcer #2: [quickly] Your dreams may vary from those of Globex
              Corporation, its subsidiaries and shareholders.
-- A fair warning, "You Only Move Twice"

Homer: Well, what do you think of me and Cypress Creek now, Marge?
Marge: It does seem nicer than Springfield.
 Lisa: Yeah, did you notice how the people weren't shoving or knocking
       each other down? I've never been to a place like that before.
 Bart: [shoves her aside]  Me neither.
-- "You Only Move Twice"

% Since Cypress Creek looks like a nice town, the job would pay more,
% and the house is falling apart (vouched by the chimney crumbling),
% Marge agrees to move. That is, as soon as they can sell the house...

Oh, wow! Windows!
-- Otto takes a look at the house, "You Only Move Twice"

% The next visitor is Apu:

  Apu: Hello. I am not interested in buying your house, but I would like
       to use your rest room, flip through your magazines, rearrange
       your carefully shelved items and handle your food products in an
       unsanitary manner. Ha! Now you know how it feels!  [runs off]
Homer: Thank you. Come again.
-- Getting things off his chest, "You Only Move Twice"

% But despite the number of visitors, no one is interested in buying
% this crumbling house. Proving their point, Bart nearly falls through
% the roof, and Marge has to push him up with a broom.

      Marge: Even if we sell the house, we still don't come close to
             paying off the mortgage.
              [pause]
Homer+Marge: [getting a flash] Hey...
              [Homer nails an "Abandoned" sign to the door]
-- The answer to all your mortgage problems, "You Only Move Twice"

% Homer and Marge make the final preparations for their moving.

  Ned: Uh, huh-huh... Homer, ah... About those things you borrowed from
       me over the years, you know, the TV trays, the power sander, the
       downstairs bathtub... You gonna be... needing those things in
       Cypress Creek?
Homer: Yes.
  Ned: Oh. Uh...
Homer: [reciting] Okily dokily...
  Ned: Okily dokily!
-- 8 years of Ned-handling, "You Only Move Twice"

% And off they go, greeted by everybody in Springfield.

Homer: I'm gonna miss Springfield. This town's been awfully good to us.
 Bart: No, it hasn't, Dad. That's why we're leaving.
Homer: Oh, yeah.  [pokes his head out the window]  So long, Stinktown!
-- And thus it ends, "You Only Move Twice"

% [End of Act One. Time: 4:46]
%
% OFF drives through the woods around Cypress Creek.

It says here, one of these giant redwood trees can provide enough
sawdust to cover an entire day's worth of vomit at Disneyland.
-- Lisa reads the Cypress Creek brochure, "You Only Move Twice"

% After much "ooh"s, "ah"s and "oh"s, they finally reach their
% destination: 15201 Maple Systems Road. This house is bigger than they
% never could've imagined -- or afforded; the living room itself, which
% Bart calls immediately, could easily hold the whole 1st floor of their
% previous house.
%
% They are quickly greeted by Hank Scorpio, Globex's president.

Homer: Wow, my boss.
 Hank: Don't call me that word. I don't like things that elevate me
       about the other people. I'm just like you. Oh, sure, I come later
       in the day, I get paid a lot more and I take longer vacations,
       but I don't like the word "boss".
-- Though I like its income, "You Only Move Twice"

 Hank: Hey, look at my feet. You like those moccasins? Look in your
       closet; there's a pair for you. Don't like them? Then neither do
       I! [throws them out]  Get the hell outta here! Ever see a guy say
       good-bye to a shoe?
Homer: [chuckles]  Yeah, it's fun!
-- "You Only Move Twice"

Marge: Mr. Scorpio, this house is almost too good for us. I keep
       expecting to get the bum's rush.
 Hank: We don't have bums in our town, Marge, and if we did they
       wouldn't rush; they'd be allowed to go at their own pace.
-- The spirit of Cypress Creek, "You Only Move Twice"

% After a few words, Hank rushed back to the fun run he was into,
% looking forward to see Homer at work -- although he doesn't like to
% call it "work".
%
% The next day, everybody meets with his/her new life in Cypress Creek.

Marge: Okay, the oven is cleaning itself, the autovac's on dirt patrol,
       and Maggie's enjoying her Swing-A-Majig.
        [said Maggie tries desperately to reach the "off" switch]
       I can't believe it. I've done all my housework, and it's only
       9:30.  [looses her smile]
       Well, better go upstairs and make sure the beds are still made.
-- Some tough competition, "You Only Move Twice"

% At work, Homer gets acquainted with his new environment, especially
% his boss.

 Hank: You will notice, my new best friend, that we are pretty casual
       around here.
Homer: Yes, sir. I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion.
-- Preaching by the example, "You Only Move Twice"

% Mr. "Scorpion" urges Homer to call him Hank, and proceeds to initiate
% him to the local atmosphere.

 Hank: Would you mind hanging my coat up on the wall, please?
Homer: Mm-hmm.  [taking his coat]  Hmm, uh, let's see...
        [the floor is one big room, with windows all around]
       Um, uh, well, uh...
 Hank: [laughs]  Relax, Homer. At Globex, we don't believe in walls.
       Matter of fact, I didn't even give you my coat.
Homer: Mmm?  [his hands are indeed empty]
        [Hank is now wearing his coat]
       Wow.
-- Better than Houdini and Copperfield put together,
      "You Only Move Twice"

% While they exercise a little on a treadmill, Hank tells Homer that
% Globex was his lifelong dream. They next step on a moving sidewalk,
% and Homer confides his own lifelong dream. Hank understands: "They
% laughed at me the first time I wore jeans with a sport coat."
%
% They step in Homer's workstation, where three people busily working on
% computers welcome them.

These gentlemen here will be your eyes and your ears, and should the
need arise, they'll fill in for any other part of your body.
-- Which one's the beer belly?, "You Only Move Twice"

 Hank: Your job will be to manage and motivate them. Give 'em the
       benefit of your years of experience.
Homer: Don't worry, that won't take long.
-- About two minutes and a half, "You Only Move Twice"

 Hank: The key to motivation is trust. Let me show you what I mean. I
       want you to close your eyes and fall backwards, and I'll catch
       you. That's gonna show you what trust is all about. Ready?
Homer: Right.
 Hank: Three... Two...  [phone rings]  One second...
        [Hank answers the phone and Homer falls to the ground]
       Oh, my God, the guy's on the floor.
       Uh, that was a phone call; don't chalk that up to mistrust, now.
-- "You Only Move Twice"

% The phone call was carrying bad news: somebody ate part of Hank's
% lunch. He must leave to investigate the matter.

 Hank: I'm gonna leave everything to you. We're on a tight schedule. You
       keep them motivated.  [he leaves]
        [his staff is busily working]
Homer: [to staff]  Are you guys working?
Man 1: Yes, sir, Mr. Simpson.
Homer: Could you, um... work any harder than this?
Man 2: Sure thing, boss.
        [they do]
Homer: Hey, call me Homer.
-- You too can learn my secrets to successful mananagement,
      "You Only Move Twice"

% The other half of the family, namely the kids, step in for their first
% day at Cypress Creek Elementary. Bart manages to fit in pretty well,
% by doing some armpit noises.

Kid 1: You got a fresh sound. It'll play well at this school.
Kid 2: [looking a lot like Milhouse]  Hey, Bart, do you have a best
       friend yet? 'Cause I've been looking for someone to boss me
       around.
-- That's hard to find around here, "You Only Move Twice"

% Unfortunately for Bart, things get bad once the grammar course starts,
% as cursive writing is giving problems to him.

Teacher: So, you never learned cursive?
   Bart: Um, well, I know hell and damn and bit...
-- Saved by the bleep, "You Only Move Twice"

% It seems Bart is years behind of schedule, so he's transferred to a
% "more remedial environment", ie. the leg-up program.
%
% At home, the situation isn't that bright either when Marge find out
% that automatic sprinklers are watering the flowers. In fact,
% everything is just perfect, which leaves her with nothing else to do
% than to sip a glass of wine.
%
% Back to school, Bart meets with his new classmates.

  Bart: So, what are you in for?
 Gordy: [slowly and strangely sounding]  I moved here from Canada, and
        they think I'm slow, eh?
   Dot: I fell off the jungle gym and when I woke up I was in here.
Warren: I start fires.
-- Dead Leg-Up Society, "You Only Move Twice"

Teacher: Okay. Now, everyone take out your safety pencil and a circle of
         paper. This week, I hope we can finish our work on the letter
         "A".
   Bart: Let me get this straight. We're behind the rest of our class
         and we're going to catch up to them by going slower than they
         are?  [making "crazy" gesture]  Cuckoo.
   Kids: [imitating him]  Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo.
Teacher: Stop it! Stop it! Warren! Melvin! Gary! Dot! Gordy!
-- My new menagerie, "You Only Move Twice"

   Bart: Listen lady, I'm s'pose to be in the fourth grade.

% Up to this point, the only Simpson who seems to be enjoying herself is
% Lisa, as she gazes upon the beauties of the neighborhood woods.

Lisa: [to a nearby chipmunk]  Hello, Mr. Chipmunk. You're a northern
      reticulated chipmunk. Yes, you are.  [pokes its nose]  You are so
      reticulated.

 Bart: Why don't you buy it?
Homer: I can't buy that. Only management-type guys with big salaries

-- He's getting it, "You Only Move Twice"

% At work, Homer's wearing his Tom Landry hat and coaching his team, but
% they're quite exhausted from the work he's asking from them. From

% hammocks. He goes straight to his "boss".

 Hank: Uh, hi, Homer. What can I do for you?
Homer: Sir, I need to know where I can get some business hammocks.
 Hank: Hammocks? My goodness, what an idea. Why didn't I think of that?
       Hammocks! Homer, there's four places. There's the Hammock Hut,
       that's on third.
Homer: Uh-huh.
 Hank: There's Hammocks-R-Us, that's on third too. You got
       Put-Your-Butt-There?
Homer: Mm-Hmm.
 Hank: That's on third. Swing Low, Sweet Chariot... Matter of fact,

 Hank: Good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Scorpio. I have the Doomsday

Homer: Uh... I... no.
