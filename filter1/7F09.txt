Marge: [making pork chops]
       A dash of rosemary, a smidgen of thyme, a pinch of marjoram...
Homer: You know, Marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world.
Marge: Oh, Homer, they're nothing special.  The extra ingredient is care.
       [continues her work]
       A sprinkle of chervil, a teaspoon of tumeric, and a whisper of MSG.
-- How much care am I supposed to add?  ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

Homer: Marge, I'm going to build you a spice rack.
Marge: Oh, you don't have to go to all that trouble just for me.
Homer: It's no trouble!  I got a whole <garage> of tools I never use!

% Meanwhile, the kids watch an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon on the Krusty
% the Klown show.  Downstairs, Homer sets to work...

Ah, here it is.  The complete handyman's bookshelf.  Volume 1:  Spice racks.
-- Homer sets to work to build a spice rack, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Homer produces a clump of wood and nails whose resemblance to a spice
% rack is tenuous at best.  Maggie appears and clonks Homer on the head
% with a mallet.  Upstairs, Homer's head is bandaged...

Bart:  Hey Dad, can you move your head?
Homer: No, I can't.  It's broken...
-- Is it in a cast?  ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Marge sees the I&S cartoon and concludes that was the cause of Maggie's
% actions.

Maggie: [picks up a pencil]  [wacko `Psycho' music plays]
Homer:  Aaaaaaaaagh!
Marge:  [picks up Maggie]  No, Maggie, bad baby!
Homer:  Keep her away from me, Marge!
        She's got that crazy look in her eyes again!

% She forbids the kids from watching the cartoons.

Marge: You won't be watching these cartoons any more.  Ever.
Lisa:  But Mom, if you take our cartoons away, we'll grow up without a sense
       of humor and be robots.
Bart:  Really?  What kind of robots?

% Milhouse invites Bart to watch I&S at his house.  Meanwhile, Homer phones
% in sick...

You heard me, I won't be in for the rest of the week. ...
I told you!  My baby beat me up! ...
No, it is not the worst excuse I ever thought up. ...
[sotto voce] Wise guy.
-- Homer phones in sick after, well, you know, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Marge wonders why Bart and Lisa are so late from school (because they're
% watching I&S with Milhouse and Janie, respectively).  At the Simpsons
% residence, Marge watches I&S and takes careful notes.

Marge: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
Homer: [laughs]
Marge: Mm...
-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Marge decides to write a letter.

Dear purveyors of senseless violence:
I know this may sound silly at first, but I believe that the cartoons you
show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way.
Please try to tone down the psychotic violence in your otherwise fine
programming.  Yours truly, Marge Simpson.
-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Mr. Meyers sends back his reply...

Myers: Take a letter, Miss White.
       Dear valued viewer, thank you for taking an interest in the Itchy
       and Scratchy program.  Enclosed is a personally autographed photo of
       America's favorite cat and mouse team to add to your collection.
       In regards to your specific comments about the show, our research
       shows that one person cannot make a difference, no matter how big
       a screwball she is, so let me close by saying...
Marge: [reading the letter] And the horse I rode in on?
       I'll show them what one screwball can do!

Lisa:  There's peas <everywhere>!
-- The infamous TV dinners, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Marge apologizes for the dinners and forbids Bart from watching cartoons.

% The Krusty the Klown show is on the air...

Krusty: Hi Kids! [laughs]  Guess what, Sideshow Mel!
Mel:    [slide whistle three times]
Krusty: It's time for Itchy and Scratchy!
Kids:   [really, parents]  Boo!
Krusty: Hey, hey, settle down boys and girls, or Krusty will

% Marge leads the parents in a chant...

Marge: What do we want?
Crowd: Less and less violence in children's programming!
Marge: When do we want it?
Crowd: Now!
-- We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take it any more,
   ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Krusty tries to contain the crowd, with no success.  Mr. Meyers
% reviews the videotape in his office, then holds a meeting.

Meyers:  That screwball Marge Simpson, we've got to stop her.  But how?
Man #1:  Drop an anvil on her?
Man #2:  Hit her on the head with a piano.
Woman:   Stuff her full of TNT, then throw a match down her throat and run?
Meyers:  All your fancy degrees and that's the best you can do?
         You make me sick!
All:     [agree meekly]

% The crowd of protesters outside I&S Intl gives a cartoonist an idea...
% Homer and Marge watch I&S ...

You know, some of these stories are pretty good.
I never knew mice lived such interesting lives.

% see the connection.  Marge is invited to appear on `Smartline'.

Hello, I'm Kent Brockman, and welcome to another edition of `Smartline'.
Are cartoons too violent for children?  Most people would say, ``No, of
course not, what kind of stupid question is that?''
-- The value of objectivity in reporting, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% His guests are Marge, Roger Meyers (CEO of I&S, Intl), and
% Krusty (``Hi, kids!''), and ...

Joining us live, via satellite from Vienna, home of Sigmund Freud, the
world's greatest psychiatrist, to give us an insight into the human mind,
Dr. Marvin Monroe.
-- `Smartline', ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''
   [Does that make Freud or Monroe the world's greatest psychologist?]

% After a brief clip of I&S, the debate begins...

Meyers: I did a little research and I discovered a startling thing...
        There was violence in the past, long before cartoons were invented.
Kent:   I see.  Fascinating.
Meyers: Yeah, and know something, Karl?  The Crusades, for instance.
        Tremendous violence, many people killed, the darned thing went
        on for thirty years.
Kent:   And this was before cartoons were invented?
Meyers: That's right, Kent.
-- `Smartline', ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Dr. Marvin Monroe adds his two cents...

Well, Kent, to me, the hijinks of a few comic characters absolutely pales
in comparison to the crippling emotional problems a psychiatrist runs into
every day.  I'm referring to women who love too much, fear of winning,
sexaholism, stuff like that.
-- Dr. Marvin Monroe on `Smartline', ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Krusty is next...

Kent:   For another opinion...
Krusty: [laughs]  Hi, kids!  [laughs]
Kent:   Krusty, please.  We're giving you the opportunity to participate in
        a serious discussion, here.
Krusty: Oh, I'm sorry Kent.  Just that when the camera gets on me, I just...
        Hey! [throws a custard pie in his own face]  [honks horn]
Kent:   Krusty!
Krusty: [honks horn]  [cowers]

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:00]
%
% While Marge makes her famous pork chops, she takes a phone call from Mr.
% Meyers who asks Marge for a nonviolent solution to their cartoon.

Meyers: [explaining on the phone]
        Itchy just stole Scratchy's ice cream cone, and...
Animator: Oh, make it a pie.  Pies are easier to draw.
Meyers: [to animator] Okay, a pie!
        [to Marge]  Anyway, Scratchy is understandable upset.
Marge:  Uh huh.
Meyers: So we figured he could just, you know, grab Itchy and toss him into
        a bucket of acid.
-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

Marge:  Couldn't Itchy share his pie with Scratchy?
        Then they would <both> have pie!
Meyers: [walks to storyboard, considers, steps back]
        It's different, I'll give you that...

% Homer watches TV with the kids...

Announcer:  It's a tool that every home handyman needs!

       How much would you pay for a machine that can do all this?
Homer: One thousand dollars!
Announcer:  Oh, don't answer yet...
Homer: Oh, sorry.
Announcer:  Because you also get...
-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Marge tells the kids they can watch cartoons again, and they eagerly do
% so.  But something is subtly different...

They love! They share!

Love, love, love!
Share, share, share!
The Itchy and Scratchy Show!
-- A kinder, gentler cartoon, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% `Porch Pals' is completely devoid of content...

Lisa:  Itchy and Scratchy seem to have lost their edge...
Marge: Well, I think it conveys a very nice message about sharing.
Bart:  I think it sucks.
-- A kinder, gentler cartoon, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Homer is startled by Maggie, but she was just handing him a glass of
% lemonade.  The kids give up.

Marge: Aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?
Bart:  Naah.  Come on, Li.
Lisa:  Maybe there's something else to do on this planet...
-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% The scene is repeated in TV rooms all across town, and (to the strains
% of the first 53 bars of Beethoven's 6th Symphony) the kids step outside,
% rub their eyes, and proceed to do wholesome childlike things.

Krusty:  Hi, kids!  [laughs]
         [sees empty studio]
         Huh?  Is it Saturday?
-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% At dinner, Marge asks the kids what they did.  Bart and the guys went
% fishing, and Lisa and Janie went bird-watching.  They excuse themselves
% to work on the soapbox racers.  Homer is amazed.  In Florence...

Artist:   This will be the art event of the century.  The greatest
          masterpiece of the Italian renaissance, Michelangelo's David,
          on a coast-to-coast tour of United States.
Reporter: Uh, sir, which cities will be included on your itinerary?
Artist:   Eh, New York, Springfield, and if we have time, Chicago,
          Boston, Los Angeles.
-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Marge answers the door early in the morning.  It's Maude and Helen,
% recruiting Marge to protest with them against David.

Helen: You've got to lead our protest against this abomination!
       [shows newspaper article]
Marge: Mm, but that's Michelangelo's David.  It's a masterpiece.
Helen: [gasp]  It's filth!  It graphically portrays parts of the human body,
       which, practical as they may be, are evil.
Marge: But I like that statue.
Helen: [gasp]  I told you she was soft on full frontal nudity!
       Come on, girls...
-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% The crowd (sans Marge) storm to the airport and tell them to take the
% statue away.  This prompts another `Smartline' episode.

Is it a masterpiece or just some guy with his pants down?
That's our topic tonight on Smartline...
-- Kent Brockman, on the coming of Michelangelo's David to Springfield,

% But Kent is confused when Marge isn't opposed to the statue.

Kent:  Aren't you Marge Simpson the wacko?
Marge: Mm... Yes and no.

% Dr. Marvin Monroe (via satellite from Athens, with a camera around his neck)
% points out the inconsistency in Marge's logic, since she supports one form
% of freedom of expression, but not another.  Marge concedes defeat.

I guess one person <can> make a difference, but most of the time,
they probably shouldn't.

I'd like to alert our affiliates that we will be ending our show early tonight.
Join us tomorrow, when our topic will be, ``Religion:  Which is the one true
faith?''

% The playfields lie unused as the kids are back inside watching cartoons.
% I&S pull out bigger and bigger guns until Itchy shoots Scratchy into the

% to see David.

Well, there he is.  Michelangelo's `Dave'.
-- Homer admires Renaissance art, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

% Marge is disappointed that the kids, rather than seeing a great piece
