% It's an evening at the Springfield Pops at Jebediah Springfield Park
% (sandwiched in between medfly sprayings).  Homer and Marge watch the
% orchestra from atop a hill on a blanket on the grass.

  Marge: Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a
         little culture?
  Homer: Peh.  They're butchering the classics.  Could that bassoon have
         come in any more late?
  Marge: Aw, come on, Homer, there's lasers.  You like lasers...
  Homer: Laser effects, mirrored balls...John Williams must be rolling
         around in his grave.

% away," she further pleads, "come on, come on!"  Seeing as no one wants
% to chase him, she runs after him herself.  "No, Marge!" calls Homer in
% pursuit, but he can't follow for long: his breath becomes too labored
% and he stops, panting painfully.
%
% Marge starts to gain on the multiply-convicted felon; seeing this, he
% turns down an alley, still pursued by Marge.  When he sees it's a dead
% end and that he's trapped, he turns around and flicks open a

% Wiggum and some other policemen arrive on the scene.

Wiggum: We'll try to make it twelve.

Wiggum: Ah.  Sorry to lose you, Simpson.
 Lenny: [in the kitchen] I don't think they're coming back.
   Moe: All right, that does it: I'm looking at his cards.
         [does so] Aw, crap.  I fold.
