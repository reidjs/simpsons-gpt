       You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is.
Bart:  Kwyjibo.  Uh... a big, dumb, balding North American ape.  With no chin.
Marge: And a short temper.

Ms.K: Shhh!  [points to her head]  Visualize it, Bart!
Bart: [visualizing in black-and-white]  At the same time, the local train
      travelling 30 miles an hour and carrying 40 passengers leaves Phoenix
      bound for Santa Fe.  It is eight cars long and always carries the

      landscape.]
      An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of
      minutes past the hour get off, and three times as many plus six
      get on.  [Bart and his equation are trampled by the passengers.]

Marge: [whispers to Homer]

Bart: Oh, like you're reading my mind, man.

Dr.J:  No, I think we should move him to another school.

Homer: My son, a genius!?  How does it happen?

Marge: It's a big day for you.  Why don't you eat something a little more

Homer: Nonsense, Marge.  Frosty Krusty Flakes is what got him where he

Lisa:  [looks up from her granola]
