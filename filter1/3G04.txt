% Act one.  Homer is standing in chains before a court composed completely 
% of immense, talking doughnuts of various shapes, colors, and flavors.  The
% judge, assumably, is a white doughnut seated at a table across from him.

White Doughnut: Homer Simpson, you stand accused of eating half the 
                population of the planet of the doughnuts!
                [The doughnut onlookers give out a mass yell of protest.]
 Pink Doughnut: As Homer's defense attorney, I feel we should be mercifu...
                hey!  Did you just take a bite out of me?
         Homer: Uh... maybe.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Homer's bizarre dream comes to an end after he is eaten by a large brown
% ball.  It turns out he's napping at his station in sector 7G, where Lenny 
% is shaking him. They go for their coffee break. There is only one donut
% left, so Homer insists that they enlarge it in the reactor core by
% exposing it to radiation.

% Homer, placing the doughnut into an isolated reaction room, manipulates
% it by means of a joystick into a container of bright green goo.  A 
% caption reading "Ten Minutes Later" displays, showing a cooling tower on 
% fire outside the nuclear power plant.  Smithers, dressed in a radiation 
% suit, discovers what the problem was.  He holds the charred remains of 
% Homer's last doughnut in a pair of tongs.

Smithers: Uh, sir, we found the problem.  Some idiot threw this in the
          reactor core.
   Homer: [sees charred doughnut] Success!
   Burns: You did this?  How could you be so irresponsible?
   Homer: Eh... it's my first day!
   Burns: Since I've never seen you before, maybe it is your first day.  
          Very well, carry on!
          [Mr. Burns begins to walk off, when Smithers catches up with him.]
Smithers: Sir, that's Homer Simpson.  He's been working here for ten years!
   Burns: Ohh, really?  Why did you think you could lie to me?
   Homer: It's my first day!
   Burns: Well, why didn't you say that be...[realizes] Yawoo! You're fired!

% Homer, in his pajamas, sits on his couch watching television, remote in
% hand.  Lisa sits at his feet, reading the latest issue of "Junior Skeptic".
% Homer is sad because of his sudden unemployment.

Announcer: Next, on Exploitation Theatre... Blackula, followed by 
           Blackenstein, and the Blunchblack of Blotre Blame!
    Homer: [watching] Oooh, funky!
-- "Simpson Tide"

% But first, a commercial for the Navy comes on.

Announcer: Daybreak: Tucawka.  The proud men and women of the Navy are 
           fighting for freedom.  But you're in Lubba, Texas, hosing stains 
           off a monument.  You're in the Naval Reserve.  America's 
           seventeenth line of defense, between the Mississippi National 
           Guard, and the League of Women Voters.  After basic training, 
           you'll only have to work one weekend a month.  And most 
           of that time, you're drunk off your ass.
-- And how, "Simpson Tide"

% Homer decides to join.

% Homer visits the local recruitment office for the Naval Reserve.

Recruiter: Just fill out this form, and you're on your way to the reserve.
    Homer: There's a question that's crossed out.
Recruiter: Well... due to a recent presidential order, we're not allowed to
           ask that particular question.
    Homer: I think I can make it out!  [reading] "Are you a homosex..."
Recruiter: For God's sake, don't answer that, I could go to jail!
    Homer: But I'm not a...
           [The Recruiter covers his ears and starts singing.]
Recruiter: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, I am not lis-ten-ing!  La, la, la, 
           la, la...[exits]
    Homer: Nice fella.  I wonder if he's gay?
-- We call ourselves gay... because we are gay, "Simpson Tide"

% In bed, Marge confronts Homer about this latest stunt.

Marge: Homey, I really don't think this Navy thing is a good idea.  What if
       you get called into combat?
Homer: Not to worry, honey.  We live in a highly technological age where
       fighting a war is as simple as turning off a light!
       [To illustrate, Homer claps his hands together twice and looks at the 
       lamp.  Having no luck, he continues clapping.]
Marge: We don't have a clapper.
Homer: Sorry, I can't hear you Marge, I'm clapping.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Homer, frustrated, throws the lamp out his window, shattering the glass.  
% It lands in the front yard.

% Later, Homer announces his new occupation to his friends at Moe's tavern.

 Homer: Well guys, I won't be seeing you for a while.
Barney: Where you going?
 Homer: I've joined the Naval Reserve!
Barney: Well, I'm not gonna let anything happen to my best friend.  I'm
        joining too!
   Moe: Well I'm not going to let anything happen to my two best
        customers.  I'm joinin' too!
   Apu: And although my religion strictly forbids military service, what the 
        hey!  I'm in too!
-- Ahimsa is lost on him, "Simpson Tide"

% The four knock their mugs together in a toast.

Homer: Gee, thanks guys.  This is just like "The Deerhunter".
  Moe: "The Deerhunter"?  Ah, hah, that reminds me...
       [Moe runs into a room in the back where Principal Skinner and Krusty
       the Clown sit at a table.  Tough-looking Asians stand all around
       them, and one sits with them, handing a gun to Krusty while shouting
       in another language.]
  Moe: [interrupting] I'm sorry guys, we're shuttin' down for a while.
       Sorry.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Homer prepares to say goodbye to his family while waiting for the bus
% to pick him up at the Naval Reserve.

Homer: See you in a week!
 Lisa: Good luck, Dad!  Although I'm morally opposed to the Military 
       Industrial Complex of which you are now a part.
Homer: Aw, that's sweet, honey.  I'll bring you back a hat.
 Bart: Hey, Homer, bring me back a torpedo.
Homer: No.
 Bart: But Flanders got his kids torpedoes!
Homer: Oh, he did, did he?  I'll show him!  I'll bring you a weapon of
       unimaginable destructive power!
Marge: Homer!
Homer: But only if you're good! [to Bart] Even if you're not.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% At basic training, Homer lines up for inspection, as his Drill Sargeant
% gives the usual introduction for new recruits.

Drill Sargeant: All right, you thumb-sucking worms.  Let's get one thing
                straight.  Your mommas ain't here to help you.
        Barney: Mine is!
                [A woman resembling Barney, not far away, belches.]
-- That showed him, "Simpson Tide"

% In the camp barbershop, the naval trainees are given the appropriate
% haircuts.  When it comes to Homer's turn, he balks.

No way, man!  My hair is who I am!
-- Homer, "Simpson Tide"

% The barbers shave Homer anyway, removing the few strands of hair Homer 
% has left.

Ohh, I'm a freak!
-- Homer loses his hair, "Simpson Tide"

% In their private quarters, Homer puts up a black-and-white picture of
% Marge by his bunk.  Barney counters by putting up a similar picture,
% this one of what looks like Homer dressed as a woman.  Homer looks on 
% questioningly.  Some time later, the Drill Sargeant inspects the
% freshly-shaven recruits' appearances.

Drill Sargeant: Tuck in that shirt!  Shine those shoes, mister!  [arrives at
                Homer's place in line] Oh, for the love of...
         Homer: Eh, a seagull took my sailor hat.
Drill Sargeant: All right, Simpson.  I don't like you, and you don't like 
                me.
         Homer: I like you.
Drill Sargeant: Um, all right.  You don't like me, but I don't like you.
         Homer: Maybe you would like me if you got to know me.
Drill Sargeant: What are you, a comedian?
         Homer: Well, I'm no Margaret Show!  But I do a pretty fair
                Columbo impression.
                [Homer turns his head away momentarily and turns back
                around.]
         Homer: [doing impression] Eh, one more si...[coughs]...one...I
                should get a glass of water.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% The Drill Sargeant snarls frustratingly at Homer.  Switch scenes to later,
% where Homer ties a large rope to the dock.

         Homer: There, the perfect sheepshank!
Drill Sargeant: Very nice, Simpson.  But next time, tie the other end to the
                ship!
-- "Simpson Tide"

% A large vessel drifts away, out to sea, and off a waterfall.  The shouts
% of men are heard as the boat falls to the rocks.  It doesn't seem to matter
% much, however, as graduation day soon comes for Homer.

Drill Sargeant: Congratulations, sailors.  You're all in the Naval Reserve!

% The graduates throw their sailor hats into the air.  Move to a graduation
% ceremony for pastry chefs.

Chef: [ridiculous French accent] Congratulations!  You are all pastry chefs!

% The graduting chefs throw their hats into the air.  Switch scenes to
% yet another gradution ceremony, where students in World War I era 
% spike-topped German helmets listen to the speaker.

Instructor: Congratulations!  You are all World War One historical 
            re-creationists!

% The men throw their hats up, which immediately point back down at them 
% while traveling in the air.  "Uh oh," the graduates say in realization.

[End of Act one.  Time: 6:32.]

% Act two.  Bart and Milhouse are waiting for the school bus.

Milhouse: Hey, Bart.  Check out my new earring.  Pretty cool, huh?
    Bart: Milhouse, my Mom wears earrings.  Do you think she's cool?
Milhouse: No!  I think she's hot!  Sorry... it just slipped out.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% The bus pulls up, and Milhouse gets on first.  He stands in front of the
% rest of the kids, who, upon noticing the earring, go silent.

Jimbo: Hey look!  Milhouse has an earring!
       [Everyone on the bus starts chanting Milhouse's name in recognition
       of his newfound coolness.]
 Bart: Hey, if you want cool, check this out.
       [Bart starts to "Do the Bart, Man", dancing at the front of the bus.]
 Bart: [singing and dancing] Everybody if you can do the Bart, Man!  Shake 
       your body turn it out if you can, can!  Do the Bart, Man, yeah!
       [The children look on, unimpressed.]
Ralph: That is so 1991.
-- Irony rears it's ugly head, "Simpson Tide"

% At the Springfield Elementary playground, Bart and Milhouse hang out on
% the jungle gym, where Principal Skinner confronts Milhouse about his breach
% of school dress code.

 Skinner: Young man, the school dress code specifically forbids the wearing
          of earrings unless you're of Gypsy obstraction.
Milhouse: Well, uh, I'm a Gypsy.
 Skinner: Oh, really!  Prove it.
Milhouse: [imitating a vampire] Uh, I vant to suck your blood!
 Skinner: Uh-uh, that's a vampire.  But, uh, they're also covered.  
          Carry on.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% After watching Homer use his new skills as a member of the Naval Reserve
% to help his marriage, we shift scenes to the "Veterans of Unpopular Wars"
% building, where Abe drinks a beer with a man wearing an eyepatch.

Man With Eyepatch: Lost this eye in Haiti.  I was drinking a Mai Tai, and I
                   forgot to take the little parasol out.
-- Unpopular war stories from unpopular wars, "Simpson Tide"

    Abe: That's not a war story!  I'll tell ya a war story!  I was on PT-109 
         with John F. Kennedy!  I was the first to discover his terrible 
         secret...
         [In Abe's flashback, he and three other seamen listening to Kennedy,

-- "Simpson Tide"

% The four of them start beating on Jack; later, at the Naval Reserve Tour,
% Bob Denver, dressed in his Gilligan outfit, is on stage, addressing the
% group of sailors.

And another thing!  When people come up to me and say, "Hey, little buddy!",
and hit me over the head with a hat, that's not funny.  That hurts!
[The crowd laughs and claps.]
Stop laughing at me!!
-- Bob Denver, "Simpson Tide"

% Back at home...

Homer: You know, Marge, joining the reserves was the best thing I ever did.
       I feel good about myself, I'm helping my country, and later I'm going
       to get Gilligan's autograph.
Marge: I'm so proud of you, Homey!
Homer: Then I'll whomp him with my hat! [laughs]
-- "Simpson Tide"

% On a totally unrelated note, Bart, while walking through the Springfield
% Mall, passing several Starbucks, goes into a store called "In and Out 
% Piercing".

Employee: Can I help you?
    Bart: I'd like to get my ear pierced.
Employee: Well, better make it quick, kiddo.  In five minutes this place is
          becoming a Starbucks.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Bart gets his ear pierced, and has a diamond-shaped clear stone inserted
% into the new hole.  As he leaves the store, it, like all of the other stores
% above and around it, is transformed into Starbucks.  Bart goes home.

 Bart: Hello, everybody!  Sparkle, sparkle!
Homer: [sees earring, angry] Bart!
 Lisa: An earring, how rebellious!  In a conformist sort of way.
-- She speaks the truth, "Simpson Tide"

Marge: What on earth possessed you to get an earring?
 Bart: Milhouse has one.
Marge: If Milhouse jumped off a cliff...
 Bart: Milhouse jumped off a cliff?!  I'm there!
Homer: Get back here, boy.  You're a disgrace to this family and its proud
       naval tradition.
 Bart: Well, I'm keeping this earring and you can't stop me!
Homer: Oh...I always thought Lisa would be the one to get her ears pierced.
 Lisa: Can I?
Homer: No!
-- It looks cheap, "Simpson Tide"

% Bart, new earring in place, shows up at school expecting the benefits of
% being cool, but instead only finds that everyone's got one now.  Even Ralph
% Wiggum, whose star-shaped ornament is caught on his shirt, bending his neck
% awkwardly.

Ralph: My neck hurts and my ear hurts!  I have two owwie's!
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Homer and his fellow members of the Naval Reserve are briefed about the
% upcoming activities.

Officer: Next weekend, we're having our annual war games.  Now Simpson, 
         because of your many years as a nuclear technician, we're putting 
         you on a nuclear sub.
  Homer: "Nuc-u-lar".  It's pronounced "nuc-u-lar".
Officer: Oh, whatever.
  Homer: "Nuc-u-lar".
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Later, Homer says good-bye to his family in the rain before leaving for
% the war games.  Lisa, in her raincoat, hugs her father good-bye.

 Lisa: Be careful, Dad.
Homer: Oh, Lisa, it's just war games.  It's not like a game could hurt me.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Homer imagines a game hurting him--Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots--as his head
% is attacked by toy robots on either side of him.

Damn you, "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots"!  Can't we all just get along?
-- Homer, "Simpson Tide"

% Homer is broken out of his daydream with the concerns of Marge.

Marge: Are you sure you'll be okay?
Homer: We have orders not to fire on anybody but Greenpeace!  [kisses Marge]
       Well, I guess that's everyone.  Except earring boy.
 Bart: Come on, Dad.  Didn't you ever do anything wild when you were a kid?
Homer: Well, when I was ten I got my ear pierced.  But this is completely
       different!
-- A double standard, "Simpson Tide"

% Bart bitterly gives the earring to Homer, and runs off.  Later, the crew
% of the U.S.S. Jebediah stands, waiting for the Captain to speak.

Announcer: Attention on deck!  Captain Tenille wishes to address you!
  Tenille: [clears throat] I'm a man of few words. [pause] Any questions?
    Homer: Uh, is the poop deck really what I think it is?
  Tenille: [laughs] I like the cut of your jib.
    Homer: What's a jib?
  Tenille: [laughs, then speaks to announcer] Promote that man.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% The submarine, sailing at surface level across the sea, is under the
% command of Captain Tenille, who explains to us naval tradition while 
% smoking a cigar.

Tenille: The Navy has a fine sense of tradition.  Whenever an American 
         vessel leaves port, the crew sings this ancient sea chanty.  Ah 
         one, ah two, ah three, ah four...

% The entire crew begins singing "In The Navy".  Homer, Moe, and Barney 
% mop and dance to the music, while the Village People dance on deck with
% Smithers.  As the song winds down, Tenille throws his cigar into the water
% and climbs down the hatch with the rest of the crew on-deck.  The Village
% People are left to sink or swim, and apparently, they sink, as only a 
% construction helmet, an Indian headdress, and a cowboy hat remain floating
% in the water.

% Later, after the ship is submerged, a whale passes by the ship, emitting
% a shrill cry.  Several officers sit inside a crowded room, enjoying dinner.

Tenille: Did you hear that?  The whales are hungry.  Homer?  Join us.
  Homer: Thank you.
Tenille: Tell me, young man, what do you want out of life?
         [While Tenille was speaking, Homer was busy trying to reach a bowl
         of peas from the center of the table.]
  Homer: I want peas!
Tenille: We all want peace!  But it's always just out of reach.
  Homer: [moans] Uh huh?
Tenille: So, what's the best way to get peace?
  Homer: With the knife!
Tenille: Exactly!  Not with the olive branch, but the bayonet!  Ha, ha, 
         Simpson, you're like the son I never had.
  Homer: And you're like the father I never visit.
-- But not as ugly!, "Simpson Tide"

% A female officer comes into the room.

Female Officer: Sir, I was running a diagnostic and there was an obstruction 
                in torpedo tube number one.
       Tenille: I'll take care of it! [thinks] Oh, what the hell!  
                Simpson, while I'm gone, you're in command!
         Homer: Me?
Female Officer: Him?
       Tenille: Yes!  Maybe it's the saltwater in my veins, or the 
                nitrogen bubbles in my brain, but I've taken a real 
                shine to you. (walks off)
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Tenille goes to the torpedo room.  Barney and his mother are on duty
% there.

    Tenille: [to Barney] Seaman!  Open that torpedo tube!
Mrs. Gumble: You'll never get a response talking to my son like that!  You
             gotta poke him with a stick! (pokes Barney)
     Barney: Mom, I don't wanna go to school today...[snores]
    Tenille: Oh, for God's sake!
-- "Simpson Tide"

% With the torpedo tube open, Captain Tenille makes a shocking discovery.
% Inside, beer and bags of potato chips were being kept.

% In the command room, Homer enjoys his comfy new captain's job.  Moe, 
% serving alongside him, sees a red blip on sonar. It's an enemy sub.
% The submarines are too close for comfort...

Female Officer: Fifteen seconds to collision!  We need a decision.
         Homer: Hmm, what would the Captain say in my spot?
                [From inside the torpedo tube, fishing out garbage,
                Captain Tenille yells.]
       Tenille: Don't fire the torpedoes!
         Homer: Fire the torpedoes!
-- "Simpson Tide"

% The captain is shot out into the water; he flies head-first into the
% enemy sub.  On the nearby enemy ship, the crew decides to fire back.

% A torpedo, shot from the enemy ship, strikes Homer's sub.

We're losing power!  We're losing backup power!  We're down to mood
lighting here!
-- Moe, "Simpson Tide"

% Mood music plays, to which Homer dances.  He stops after getting a

% The submarines sails off into the water.

[End of act two.  Time: 14:55.]

% Act three.

Homer: Damage report, Mr. Moe.
  Moe: Sonar: out.  Navigation: out.  Radio: out.

  Moe: Ice-blended moccha drinks and David Schwimmer.
Homer: Yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Homer needs a way to get home without any equipment.

Homer: [writing] Yes...uh huh...carry the two... [crumples up paper]  All

       [nervous laugh]
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Homer changes his mind, and decides to take a right instead.
% With this, Homer's submarine travels from the safety of Springfield 
% Harbor out to sea, where it bounces off a drawing of a star ("D'oh!") on 
% the map, and drifts out to Russian waters.  Back in Springfield, the 
% Simpsons, minus Homer, watch the evening news.

Brockman: Well sir, treason season started early this year, as a nuclear

          [A picture of Homer, dressed as a drunk, dancing Russian, pops
          up on the screen.]
   Marge: Oh my God!
    Lisa: I told him that photo would come back to haunt him.
-- "Simpson Tide"

Brockman: Could Homer Simpson be a communist?  His father spoke out on his

     Abe: My Homer is not a communist.  He may be a liar, a pig, an idiot,
          a communist, but he is not a porn star!

% Well, it looks as if the century's greatest lie has been exposed, as

         shelter will be reserved for: Lisa Simpson, Martin Prince, our

-- The 'Superfriends' didn't make the cut?, "Simpson Tide"

% Terri walks off the stage, dejected.  Nelson gives the usual "Ha, Ha!".
% Meanwhile, the Americans are busy trying to hunt Homer down.
% They decide to drop the depth charges.
% The depth charges explode around Homer's sub, shaking it violently.
% Barney radios Homer, in the command room, with bad news.

Barney: May day, may day!  The engine room has sprung a leak!  It's filling
        up with a clear, non-alcoholic liquid!
 Homer: You mean water?
Barney: Yeah, that's it.
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Homer tells the crew they are in a tough spot and they may not get out.
% He tells them to think of their loved ones.
% While Moe dreams of a red-colored cat, Apu dreams of a cigarette 
% machine.  Homer, however, enters dreamland to think of his family, and 
% is enraged by thoughts of Bart and his earring. He realises Bart's
% earring could plug the pinhole leak.

% Homer, reawakening, runs to the leak, where he goes underwater and 
% sticks Bart's earring into the hole.  It plugs the leak successfully, 
% and Apu, Moe, and the Female Officer cheer.

  Apu: You saved us, Homer!
Homer: Mr. Moe, prepare to surface!
  Moe: You wanna stop callin' me "Mr. Moe"?
Homer: No.
-- Homer, Mr. No-Means-No, "Simpson Tide"

% The submarine surfaces.  Homer opens the hatch and sticks his head out,

American: Attention Homer Simpson: you have ten seconds to explain your
          actions before we open fire.
   Homer: Uh...it's my first day!
-- "Simpson Tide"

% Laughter comes from those on the English speaking boat.  Homer then

% Homer has to face the music before a committee of five admirals.

Admiral #1: Seaman Simpson, your actions have given the Navy a black eye
            from which it may never recover.  I would throw the book at you,

Admiral #2: I, too, would punish you, but, I'm under indictment for 
            accepting bribes from military contractors.
Admiral #3: I torpedoed a Carnival Cruise ship.
Admiral #4: Impersonating the First Lady!
-- "Simpson Tide"

% The fifth admiral doesn't even decide to speak, but instead files out,
% like the other four, in non-prosecution.  Homer stands in an empty room,

% Back in Springfield, Homer reunites with his family.

Marge: A dishonorable discharge.  It's the best we could've hoped for!
Homer: You can't spell 'dishonorable' without 'honorable'!
-- "Simpson Tide"

 Lisa: [hugs Homer] I think you're a hero, Dad!
Homer: Well, I couldn't have done it without Bart.  Boy, I guess I was wrong

Homer: I don't think so, son.
 Bart: King Cobra?  
Homer: No.
