% Bart and Homer spend a Tuesday bonding.  In the back yard, they blow up a
% watermelon by stuffing it with fireworks.  The pieces of fruit fly
% everywhere, including through a window and into Marge's hair.  Marge looks
% out the window.

Marge: Don't you two have a list of chores to do?
Bart:  Hey, we just took care of that dangerous melon that was threatening
       our garden.
Homer: Yeah, we're heroes!  But where's *our* parade?
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Next on the chore list is unsticking the drawer in the stand next to the
% front couch.  Homer struggles to pull the drawer open, knocking off and
% breaking the lamp in the process.

Homer: It's hopeless!
Bart:  [holds up a small firework] Or is it?
Homer: [not looking] Yeah, it's hopeless!
Bart:  I said, "or is it"!
Homer: [getting angry] I said, "it"-- [he finally looks] Oh!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% With the firework crammed in the drawer, Homer is about to light the fuse
% when Marge interrupts him.

Marge: Homer, what are you doing?
Homer: Listen, do you want the job done right, or do you want it done fast?
Marge: Well, like all Americans, fast, but--
Bart:  [lights the fuse] Clear!
       [The exploding firework knocks the drawer out and leaves ugly blast
       marks on the drawer and stand]
Marge: [marvels at how easily the drawer slides now] You can't argue with
       results!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Next, Bart and Homer implode the doghouse.  Santa's Little Helper whimpers,
% so Homer shows him the blueprint for the beautiful new doghouse -- "target
% date: January 2007."  The dog curls up under the blueprint.
%
% Finally, the last item on the chore list: "Get Lisa's jammed tape out of
% VCR."  With the VCR already full of fireworks, Homer adds one final
% firework.  Homer and Bart duck behind the bed before the VCR blows up.  The
% explosion blows out the windows and destroys most everything in the room.

Homer: It's gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean this place up.
Lisa:  [comes to doorway] What's going on here?!
Homer: Uh ... honey ... there's point in every father's life when he blows
       up his daughter's room.
Lisa:  Oh yeah?  You didn't blow up Maggie's room.
       [Offscreen explosion]
Homer: Oh, Lisa, this must be a rough time for you.  Do you have any friends
       or family you can stay with?
Lisa:  [choking up as she picks up a damaged stuffed bear] You've ruined all
       my stuff.
Homer: Oh, come on.  Tell us how we can make it up to you.  Hey, pretend it's
       your birthday!
Lisa:  It *is* my birthday!
Bart:  That's the spirit!  Now, what do you want to do?
Lisa:  Well, the book festival starts today...
Homer: Anything at all!  You name it!  What do you want to do?
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% So Homer grudgingly goes along with the rest of the family to the book
% festival.
%
% There, Milhouse announces a sale on poetry books, causing a stampede of
% people at his stand.
%
% At Timothy Lovejoy's stand, he's promoting his book "Someone's in the
% Kitchen with Jesus".  Marge tries a stigmuffin, and Homer tries Mary
% Magdalene's chocolate orgasm, an eclair.  When Homer bites it, the chocolate
% filling squirts out of it and hits Tom Wolfe's white suit.  He tears off
% the suit revealing an identical suit underneath.
%
% Next, Marge visits Stephen King's table.

Marge: So, Mr. King, what tale of horror and the macabre are you working on
       now?
King:  Oh, I don't feel like writing horror right now.
Marge: Oh, that's too bad.
King:  I'm working on a biography of Benjamin Franklin.  He's a fascinating
       man.  He discovered electricity, [clouds gather and King's voice
       becomes menacing] and used it to torture small animals and green
       mountain men.  And that key he tied to the end of a kite?  [thunder
       crash] It opened the gates of Hell!
Marge: Well, let me know when you get back to horror.
King:  [normal voice] Will do.  [writes a note: "Call Marge, Re: horror"]

% On stage, Professor Frink demonstrates his latest invention -- the Infocram
% 6000.  The device allows people to absorb the contents of books instantly
% by attaching an electrodes to the body.  Frink demonstrates it, getting
% electrocuted and gaining the book's knowledge.
%
% Dr. Nick has a dieting book.

Dr. Nick: With my diet, you can eat all you want, any time you want.
Marge:    And you lose weight?
Dr. Nick: Uh, you might.  It's a free country!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Bart walks through bookcases and bookcases of books "for Dummies".

Bart:   Finally books for today's busy idiot.  "Network Programming for

        "Call me Ishmael, Dummy."
        [The Dummies author is standing nearby]

% Marge and Maggie come across Christopher Walken reading "Goodnight Moon"
% to some children.  The children are terrified and carefully back away.

"Goodnight room.  Goodnight Moon.  Goodnight cow jumping over the moon."

scootching.  You in the red, chop-chop.
-- Christopher Walken, "Insane Clown Poppy"

% An event in a tent is advertised with a sign: "The Future or Reading".  Bart
% adds a "B" before "Reading", but isn't as amused as he hoped to be.  Inside
% are many authors at a table.

Kent:    Alright, does anyone have a question for our panel that's not about
         how much money they make?
         [Audience's hands go down]
Lenny:   [at microphone] Uh yeah, I'm a techno-thriller junkie, and I'd like
         to know, is the B-2 bomber more detectible when it rains?
Kent:    Oh, what do you think, Tom Clancy?
Clancy:  Well, the B-2--
Lenny:   No, no, no, I was asking Maya Angelou!
Angelou: The ebony fighter awakens, dabbled with the dewy beads of morn.
Moe:     Maya Angelou is black?
Angelou: It is a mach-5 child, forever bound to suckle from the shriveled
         breast of congress.
Lenny:   Oh, Maya, you're a national treasure!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Lisa takes the microphone next.

Lisa:    Miss Tan, I loved "The Joy Luck Club".  It really showed me how the
         mother-daughter bond can triumph over adversity.
Amy Tan: No, that's not what I meant at all.  You couldn't have gotten it more
         wrong.
Lisa:    But--
Amy Tan: Please just sit down.  I'm embarrassed for both of us.
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Lisa dejectedly sits back down next to Homer.  Homer sheepishly moves a seat
% over.
%
% Krusty the Klown is autographing his newest book, which is only 20 pages
% long, and it was written by "this guy".

Krusty:   What's your name again?
This Guy: John Updike.
Kristy:   Whoa, whoa!  I didn't ask for your life story.
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% In the book-signing line, a girl asks Bart what Krusty's like.

Bart:   Oh, he's wonderful.  He would do anything for his fans.
Krusty: Hurry up, kid!
        [Bart gives Krusty the book]
        Name?
Bart:   Hey, it's me, Bart!
        [Krusty looks confused]
        Your biggest fan!
Krusty: Hey, good for you [mumbles:] 'cause I want to know that all my
        fans....  [hands the book back]
Bart:   "K the C"?
Krusty: Hey, this pen's gotta last me all day.  Now if you could [motions
        for Bart to get out of the way] up-bup-bup-bup.  Yeah.
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Now it's the girl's turn.

Krusty: Name?
Sophie: My name is Sophie.
Krusty: Hey, good luck with that.
Sophie: I'm your daughter.
Krusty: Wha...?!
Sophie: [hugs Krusty] I finally found my daddy!
Krusty: Oh ... I think I just seltzered myself.
        [John Updike chuckles]
        Shut up, Updike!

% [End of Act One.  Time:  6:14]
%
% At Krusty's book-signing table at the book festival, Krusty tries to explain
% to Sophie why he's not her father.

Krusty: Listen, honey, a lot of kids think of me as their daddy, but I'm just
        a simple TV legend.  Here, have a key chain.  [gives Sophie a Krusty
        key chain]
Sophie: No, I'm sure you're my father.  You met my mom during the Gulf War.
Krusty: [getting nervous] Was you mother an Israeli flight attendant?
Sophie: No....
Krusty: Cokie Roberts?
Sophie: No, she was a soldier -- chestnut brown hair, kind-of shy, 32
        confirmed kills...
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Krusty starts to remember Sophie's mother, and tells her the story in a
% flashback.  Krusty was doing a comedy act on stage for the soldiers.

Krusty:    "Saddam Hussein"?  They should call him "So Damn Insane"!
Soldier 1: Hey!  You're just fanning the flames of hatred!
Krusty:    Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, just when you thought the desert couldn't
           get any hotter, it's the Cincinnati Bengal cheerleaders!
           [The cheerleaders do cartwheels onstage]
Soldier 2: I can't look at that!  I have a girlfriend back home!
Soldier 3: This is an insult to our Muslim hosts!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

During the show, a desert wind kicked up.  [The cheerleaders were covered
with a pyramid of sand.]  I sought shelter in a nearby tent.  There was your
mother -- looking like a beautiful mirage.  Maybe it was the anthrax in the
air, maybe it was it was the fact that the Arab women weren't biting, whatever
it was, it was magic.  [Krusty and Sophie's mom kissed and fell into bed.]
-- Krusty, voiceover in a flashback, "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Then, late in the morning, Sophie's mom woke up and realized she was late
% for her mission.  Krusty grabbed her arm.  "Here's your mission: get down
% with the clown!" he said.  Sophie's mom explained that she's supposed to
% assassinate Saddam.  She got away, and Krusty was worried about how a lack
% of Saddam could hurt his comedy act.
%
% Atop a desert hill, Sophie's mom found Saddam Hussein in a convoy of trucks.
% As she caught him in her bazooka's sight, Krusty tackled her in desperation.
% The bazooka's missile fired into the air and blew up a crate of Duff beer
% intended for the American soldiers.

I just saved my baseball bit!  "Who's Sayin's on first, I A-tol'ya's on
second"--
-- Krusty, right before Sophie's mother strangled him, "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Back in the present, Krusty continues his story to Sophie on a bench.

Krusty: When I came to, she was gone!  ...and the war had been over for eight
        months.  Anyway, how'd you finally find me?
Sophie: All Mom ever said was my father was some pathetic clown, so I typed
        "pathetic clown" into a search engine, and your name popped right up.
        [Car horn honks]
        It's mom!
Krusty: Hey, how ya been?  Remember me?
        [Sophie's mother scowls and revs the car engine]
        [to Sophie:] You better get going.  It was nice meeting ya.  Thanks
        for coming out.
Sophie: But ... I was hoping maybe we could do some stuff together, like go
        to the beach and junk.
Krusty: Look, you're a sweet kid, but I'm not exactly father material -- I
        curse, I gamble, I pick fights with homeless people, I...
        [Sophie starts to cry]
        What's wrong with your eyes?  You need a Claritin or something?  Oh,
        alright.  You get one trip to the beach...
        [Sophie gasps happily]
        ...with my assistant.
        [Sophie sighs disappointedly]
        Okay!  *I'll* take you!
Sophie: Yay!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% At the Simpsons' dinner table, Homer says grace.

Homer: Dear Lord, bless this humble meal, and did you hear about Krusty?
       Whoo, man!  I mean, I knew he was a player, but jeez, a kid!
Marge: Homer, that's not a prayer, that's gossip.
Homer: Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters.  So, how's Maude Flanders
       doing up there?  She playing the field?  Ooh, yeah, really?  All those
       guys?
       [The rest of the family gapes]
       Amen.
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% At the beach with Sophie, Krusty lays on a beach towel and pours himself
% a drink from a flask.  He puts on a blindfold and lays down.

Krusty: Okay, kid, there's the water.  Knock yourself out.
Sophie: Come on, Dad, let's go bodysurfing or boogieboarding!
Krusty: Listen, kid, I'm not the kind of dad who, you know, does things, or
        says stuff or looks at ya.  But the love is there!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Krusty blindly reaches in Sophie's general direction, but needs Sophie's
% help to touch her face.  Realizing that Krusty doesn't want to move, Sophie
% decides to throw a Frisbee to him.  Krusty's not to happy about having to
% sit up.  "What am I, Baryshnikov?"  But he does sit up, and he takes off
% his blindfold just in time to be hit in the head by the Frisbee.

Krusty: [chuckles]  Hey, ya beat me!  What a great day we've had, huh?
Sophie: You know, for a clown, you're not really a lot of fun.
        [They both sigh]
Krusty: Boy, fatherhood is one tough gig.  I don't get how other guys do it.
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Krusty looks at other dads at the beach.  Apu is taking his octuplets
% waterskiing.  Ned, Rod, and Todd Flanders build a sandcastle.  Kearney Jr.
% is about to club the sandcastle before Kearney explains that you're supposed
% to wait for them to finish building it before you smash it.  Homer plays
% sticky paddle ball with Lisa, Bart is carried piggyback and flies a kite,
% and Maggie blows soap bubbles in Homer's eyes.  Soon, Krusty is asking Homer
% for parenting advice.  They walk along the beach.

Krusty: You know, Homer, I've spent my whole life entertaining kids, and I
        just realized I don't know the first thing about 'em.
Homer:  Well, I won't lie.  Fatherhood isn't easy, like motherhood, but I
        wouldn't trade it for anything ... 'cept for some mag wheels.  Oh,
        man, that would be sweet.
Lisa:   [offscreen] Dad!  Dad!
Homer:  Just a second, honey.  Daddy's on his high horse.
Lisa:   [in the water, circled by a manta ray] Daaaaaad!
Homer:  Yeah, I'm watching, honey.  Nice cannonball.  [to Krusty:] Anywho,
        the key to fathering is don't overthink, 'cause overthinking is, um
        ... what were we talking about?  [points at Krusty] Ooh!  A clown!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Krusty and Sophie have a good time the rest of the day at the beach.  They
% run from the waves, but a big wave catches them from behind.  They each
% eat ice cream cones ... on a horse ... on a surfboard in the water.  Sophie
% goes fishing off a dock.  Krusty secretly pays Captain McAllister to hide
% under the dock and put fish on the line.
%
% Finally, they sit and watch the sunset.

Sophie: It's nice that you don't always have to be "on".
Krusty: I thought I *was* on!  When was I off?  That bit about the tide pool?
        I tell ya, it killed at Jacques Cousteau's funeral.
Sophie: Dad, relax.  Just enjoy the sunset.  [takes out and plays a violin]
Krusty: Hey, I know that song.  My dad used to play that when I was a boy.
        It's beautiful!
Sophie: Do you play?
Krusty: No, I guess musical talent skips a generation ... like diabetes!
        Might want to watch out for that, too.
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Krusty takes Sophie home to her mother.  Sophie is excited to tell her mom
% about the day.  Sophie invited Krusty in, but Krusty sees all the artwork
% inside depicting violence to clowns.  He decides he'd rather go to a 
% friendlier place, "like beautiful downtown Grozny!"
%
% Later, Krusty plays poker at Fat Tony's hideout with Moe, Snake, Homer, and
% Fat Tony.

Krusty:   My little girl's sharp as a tack.  I tried the "got your nose" bit

Homer:    My uncle still has my nose.
Krusty:   [looks at his cards: four aces and a king; he tries to contain his

Moe:      I'm out.
Snake:    Fold-o-rama.
Homer:    Can we make this hand high-low?
Fat Tony: No.
Homer:    I fold.
Fat Tony: Krusty, are you in, or are you out?
Krusty:   Oh, man, I'm totally tapped.  Would you consider taking my Rolex?
Fat Tony: You mean ... this one?  [pulls up his sleeve to show the watch]
Krusty:   Oh yeah, right.  Just let me go to my car.  [leaves]
          [Homer starts singing owimoweh from "The Lion Sleeps Tonight"]
Fat Tony: Don't do that.

Fat Tony:  It is acceptable.
Krusty:    Then I'm in and I call!  Four aces -- read 'em and--
Fat Tony:  Straight flush.  [takes the pot]

Sophie: You *what*?
Krusty: But don't worry, I got you an even better one!  [hands it to Sophie]
Sophie: This is a ukulele!
Krusty: Yeah, the thinking man's violin.  Check it out.  [takes the ukulele
