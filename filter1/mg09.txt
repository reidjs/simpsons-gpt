% The usual set-up.  Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are in a room.  Maggie sits in the
% corner, sucking away on her pacifier.  Bart at stage left, Lisa at stage
% right.  Door in stage left wall.  On the wall is a picture of Homer
% holding a pitchfork.  (?)

B: Watch this ugly face.

% Bart makes an ugly face.

L: That's nothing.  Check this out.

% Lisa makes an ugly face.
%
% Maggie removes her pacifier and speaks, sort of.

A: Hah hee heh.  Heh hee how.

% Maggie makes her own ugly face.

B: That's nothing, man.  Check this...

% Marge steps in.

M: Are you kids making ugly faces?
B: Maybe.
M: Well, you know.  If you keep making those faces, you'll freeze that way.
   You'll be stuck with a horrible face forever.

% Marge leaves.

L: Do you think Mom was telling the truth?
B: Mom wouldn't lie.

% The kids consider this for a few seconds.

B+L+A: All right!

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:30]
%
% [Act Two cut in syndication.  They continue making faces, and Marge
% returns to tell them to knock it off.  When she leaves, Bart and Lisa
% try to imitate her scowl; their attempts pale next to Maggie's
% recreation (``Look at this!'').]
%
% Same as before.

B: Watch this scary face.

% Bart makes a scary face.

L: Oh yeah?  That's not scary.

% Lisa makes a scary face.

B: Oh yeah?  That's not scary.

% Bart makes another scary face.

L: Oh yeah?  That's not...

% The door creaks open.  It's Marge, with a very scary angry face.

B+L: Waaauugh!  Scary!!

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 0:46]

L: I call this face, ``The Howler Monkey''.

% Lisa does a pretty good semblance.

B: I call this face, ``Dad''.

% Bart does a very good job.
%
% Marge bursts in.

M: All right.  I told you, if you kept making those horrible faces,
   they'd freeze that way.  And now they have.
L: They have!?
B: Our faces are frozen?
M: Yes, they are.  Go look in the mirror and see for yourselves.

% The kids rush out into the hallway, where there is a tiny table over which
% is mounted a large oval mirror.  Lisa leads the way, followed by Bart,
% then Maggie.  Lisa trips and falls flat on her face.  Bart does the same,
% landing on Lisa.  Maggie trips and lands on her two elder siblings.
%
% The kids get up and look into the mirror.  Their reflections are
% perfectly normal.

B+L+A: Waaauuuugh!  We're doomed!
