% history.  1936:  Jesse Owens out-races Hitler's zeppelin, and the
% enraged dictator stomps angrily out of the stadium.  1968:  Bob
% Beamon breaks the long-jump record, infuriating an aged Hitler.
% 1984:  Carlos Lopez, at age 38, becomes the oldest man to win the
% gold medal for the marathon, only to fall off the podium when he
% receives his medal.  (Hitler wasn't around for this one.)  Homer is
% inspired.

Homer:	Thirty-eight!  That's roughly my age!  Marge, after a lot
	of thought, I've decided to run the Springfield marathon.
Marge:	Oh, please.  You get exhausted watching the "Twilight
	Zone" marathon.  [laughs] I'm a regular Billy Crystal!
Bart:	You got that right.
-- "New Kids on the Blecch"

% Lisa offers some words of encouragement, which go unappreciated.
% Homer, indeed, seems to have lost track of the conversation; instead
% of vowing to run a marathon, he says he'll swap jobs with Marge, to
% see who has it tougher.
%
% Marathon day arrives.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the 97th Springfield marathon,
commemorating the time Jebediah Springfield ran across six states to
avoid his creditors.
-- Kent Brockman, "New Kids on the Blecch"

% Homer, true to his word, has entered the marathon.  He and Lisa do a
% quick pre-race equipment check.  Everything is in place.  Chief
% Wiggum fires the starting gun, and the runners take off.

Homer:	[running] I can't believe it!  I'm actually running a
	marathon.  [clutches his chest] Argh, I hit the wall!
	This is so painful!  [the pain subsides] Hey, I got my
	second wind!  [clutches his chest again] Owgh, another
	wall, I can't ... [pain subsides] Woo hoo!  Third wind!
-- "New Kids on the Blecch"

% Some other people we know, like Smithers, are also in the running.
% A whip from offscreen smacks him smartly on the back.  The camera
% angle changes to reveal that he is pulling Mr. Burns in a rickshaw.

Burns:		[whips Smithers] Faster, rickshaw driver, faster!
		[whips Smithers]
Smithers:	Sir, the whip isn't helping.
Burns:		Silence!  You call yourself a Chinaman? [*]  [whips
		Smithers again]

[*] Replaced in subsequent airings by, "You call yourself Chinese?"

% Eventually, the race nears the finish line.

And with five hundred yards to go, the runners from Australia and
Djibouti are neck-and-neck.  Two weary warriors, now burning with pain
and exhaustion.  But only one will win the grand prize -- a walking
tour of Springfield.
-- Kent Brockman, "New Kids on the Blecch"

% Bart decides to go for the prize himself.  He puts on a bushy fake
% moustache, runs onto the course, and crosses the finish line just
% ahead or those suckers who started at the beginning.  Using a

% trophy, a bird plucks off his moustache and flies away with it.

% The mob chases Bart and corners him.  A man in a convertible pulls
% up and orders Bart to get in.  Bart considers which is riskier:
% Getting in a car with a stranger, or facing a murderous mob.  He
% rolls the dice and accepts the ride, tossing his trophy aside.  The
% mob goes after it as Bart escapes.

Bart:	Who are you?
Smash:	Aw, you'll find out in due time.
Bart:	[reading an ID badge hanging from the mirror]
	Well, it says here your name is L. T. Smash.

Smash:	Well, thank you for letting me chill in your crib.
Homer:	And thank you for assuming we're hip.
Smash:	Har.  Now here's the 4-1-1.  I'm a record producer, see?
	I'm starting a new boy band, and there's a place in it for
	Bart.
Marge:	My Bart?
Smash:	Oh, yeah.  That stunt he pulled at the race shows me he's

Homer:	Now listen to me, Smash.  We're not signing anything --
	unless it's a contract.
Marge:	Why do you want Bart?  He's not much of a singer.
Smash:	Marge, it's not the singing that brings in the Sacagaweas.
	Bart's a rebel.  That's what I need for my new band -- the
	Party Posse.  [produces a contract.  Homer goes to sign
	it, but Marge stops him]
Marge:	Now, hold on; I have some concerns.
Bart:	Please, Mom.  My dream is to be a rock star.
Homer:	And my dream is to get rid of Bart.
Marge:	But ...
Homer:	How many lives must you ruin?

% It's going to take more than just Smash to make these boys stars.
% It's also going to take the help of a professional choreographer,

% quick studies; soon their 'tudes are fly and their threads are dope.
% But as for their singing ... well, that's another question
% altogether.  Smash hands the boys some sheet music.

Bart:		[reading aloud] Party Posse, we rule the earth,
		The greatest band since music's birth?
Nelson:		Isn't this song a little boastful?
Milhouse:	No one told me there was going to be boasting.
Smash:		Just take it from the top.
Posse:		[singing, if you can call it that]
		Party Posse, we rule the earth,
		The greatest band since music's birth.
Smash:		[to himself] Eugh.  [walks to a voice-enhancement
		machine] Thank you, NASA.  [starts the machine,
		which also causes some backing music to be played]
Milhouse:	[singing well] We love to sweat, and we love to
		sing.
Nelson:		We're real funky, but not threatening.
Ralph:		We're the best band in the world,
Bart:		But we'd give it all up for that special girl.
Posse:		You're my special girl.

		[audience boos]
Skinner:	That's not true!  This assembly was my idea.  I like
