% The team are finishing today's practice.

Good practice, kids. Now its time for the easiest part of any coach's job.
The cuts. Although I wasn't able to cut everyone I wanted to, I have cut a
lot of you. Wendell is cut. Rudy is cut. Janey, you're gone. Steven, I
like your hussle [Steven smiles]. Thats why it was so hard to cut you
[Steven's smile drops]. Congratulations, the rest of you made the team!
[random sighs of relief] Except you, you and you.
-- Homer, ``Bart Star''

Martin: Bart didn't get cut. What a surprise.
 Homer: Now, just because I'm his father, he will get no special treatment.
        He calls me coach just like everyone else. Which he'll be doing, as
        our new starting quarterback!
-- ``Bart Star''

% Much to the team's, including Bart's, protest, Homer's decision of Bart

% The next day, Homer, Lisa and Bart are in the car. Lisa is in the back
% reading a book, "Sports Greatest Injuries", while Bart is sat in the
% front passenger seat.

 Bart: But I can't play quarterback! I don't even know how!
Homer: Son, you can do anything you want. I have total faith in you.
 Bart: Since when?
Homer: Since your mother yelled at me. Now, how about that hug.

Excellent play, son. You panicked, but you didn't loose your cool.

% Nelson tells Bart to just throw the ball, so he does. Nelson catches

      Bart: Its gonna take a miracle for me to become a good quarterback!
Joe Namath: Excuse me, son.

Joe Namath: Thats right. My car broke down in front of your house.
      Bart: I cannot believe you are here! Do you think maybe you could give

Joe Namath: Sure! Theres only one thing you need to know to be a great
            quarterback.
Mrs Namath: Joe, hunny, I fixed it! It was just vapor lock!
Joe Namath: OK, look, I've gotta run. Remember what I told you!
-- only in the cartoons, ``Bart Star''

% Mr. Namath leaves, and Bart is left with unhelpful memories of what Joe
% Namath said. All he can remember is Namath telling him there's only one
% thing you need to know to be a great quarterback, and that his car had
% vapor lock. Bart decides he's dead.

% Bart's last resort for advice is Lisa. He's in her room telling the story.

Bart: So if I play, the guys are gonna kill me. If I don't, I'll be letting

Lisa: Well, I know you don't wanna dissapoint dad, but how do you fell
      about lying to him?
Bart: Good.

  Bart: No. I got hit by a couple of cars. I won't be able to play today.
  Girl: Yes!
 Homer: Oh, boy. Well, I'll just have to go to my backup plan. Nelson, hows

Nelson: Great!
 Homer: Good. Take this note over to the referee.
Nelson: We forfeit?
-- change of plan, ``Bart Star''

% Homer tries to convince the team that they can't play without Bart. They

    Bart: You don't get it, do you? I don't want to be your stupid
          quarterback! I quit!
   Homer: What? [beat] Well I've got news for you, mister! You can't quit!

   Marge: He's doing what he thinks is best.
   Homer: Well, if quitting is the best, maybe I should just quit my job!
