% It's breakfast time in the Simpson house.  Homer's sitting at the
% dinette, reading the paper.

Marge:	What are you reading, Homey?
Homer:	Bridge column.  [laughs] Oh, that South -- you never know 
	what he'll do next.  [turns to the comic section] Aw, look 
	at that dad in "Drabble."  He's like an unfunny version of 
	me.
Lisa:	Where's Bart?  His Mountain Dew's getting flat.
Marge:	[sees Bart in the back yard]  That's odd.  He's outside, 
	digging.
Homer:	Probably digging for drugs.
Marge:	There's no drugs out there.
Homer:	[shiftily] No ... of course not.
-- You have the right to remain silent, "Homer the Moe"

% Lisa decides to ask Bart what he's up to now.

Lisa:	What are you doing?
Bart:	Diggin'.
Lisa:	Why?
Bart:	To make a hole.
Lisa:	A hole for what?
Bart:	More diggin'.
Lisa:	[pause] Okay, then.
	[backs away as Bart continues to dig]
-- Special investigation, "Homer the Moe"

% The day passes.  Homer tries next.

Homer:	[walks up to Bart, whistling] Oh!  Hello, young man.  
	Beautiful day for digging, isn't it?
Bart:	Yup.
Homer:	Yeah.  Um, digging for anything in particular?
Bart:	Nuh-uh.
Homer:	So, I guess you wouldn't mind if I was to dig a hole of my 
	own.
Bart:	Go for it.
Homer:	Maybe I will.
Bart:	What's stopping you?
Homer:	Very little.
	[gets a shovel of his own and digs a few scoops of earth]
	[clutches his chest] Oh, God, I'm having chest pains.
	[runs in the house; in the yard, we hear his voice from 
	inside] Where's the defibrillator?  Clear!  [zap]
	[walks back outside, carrying two defibrillator paddles] 
	This thing pays for itself.
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Bart's hole grows bigger.  Marge brings in Dr. Kaufmann, a child
% psychologist.  He pursues a theory that Bart is trying to hide from
% some sort of family conflict, but doesn't get very far.
%
% Lisa warns Bart that he'll dig his way to China, but Bart is
% sanguine about the possibility.  At that moment, Chinese soldiers
% are using a satellite to spy on the Simpsons' yard.

Spy:		Those inscrutable Americans.  What are they up to 
		now?
Humungous:	I will stop them.  I am strong.  I am the great 
		Humungous.
General:	We all know you're the great Humungous.
Humungous:	Well, I'm just saying.
General:	Oh, you always just saying.
Moe:		[voice over] Homer, is this story going anywhere?
		[cut to Moe's Tavern.  Homer, Lenny, and Carl are 
		seated at the bar]
Homer:		Yes.  Eventually, I become king of the Morlocks.
Carl:		But Morlocks are from the future.
Homer:		You calling me a liar?
Moe:		Wait a minute, Homer.  If it's true, what about all 
		the stuff you weren't around for?
Lenny:		Yeah.  How'd you know the Chinese were spying on 
		you?
Homer:		Oh, I just naturally assumed.
Moe:		That is the stupidest story I ever heard, and I read 
		the entire "Sweet Valley High" series.
-- Moe wraps up the introductory plot, "Homer the Moe"

% Moe says that he's getting sick of the bar patrons' shaggy dog
% stories, so Barney shoos a literal shaggy dog out of the bar.  The
% dog growls as he leaves.

Homer:	Jeez, Moe, you've been a real crank lately.
Moe:	[pulls a shotgun and points it at Homer] You take that 
	back!
Homer:	Now you see, that's what I'm talking about.  You're always 
	pointing that shotgun at us.
Lenny:	... and calling us dumbasses.
Carl:	... which we're so not.
Moe:	But can you blame me?  Every day it's the same old 
	routine; I serve you drinks, you yak on and on and on, and 
	I never get one stinking tip.  [points to a tip jar, which 
	is covered in cobwebs]
Homer:	Maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.
Moe:	Well, what do you call this?  [stretches his lips into an 
	unholy leer, startling the guys]
Carl:	Don't do that.
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Moe gives it up; he hasn't genuinely smiled since he speared a rat
% with an ice pick.  He wishes that he still had the passion of his
% college days at Swigmore University.  (By amazing coincidence, he
% recently hung a painting of the campus in the bar.)

Carl:	Gee, uh, when you talk about that school, your voice fills 
	with, uh, what do you call it -- human feeling.
Lenny:	Yeah, maybe you should, uh, what's the expression -- go 
	back there.
Moe:	What's the word I'm searching for, uh -- yeah!  A trip to 
	the alma mater might really rekindle my love of getting 
	people loaded.
Carl:	But who'll run the bar while you're gone?
Homer:	[jumps up] Ooh!  Ooh!  Pick me!
Lenny:	Pick me -- Lenny!
Carl:	Oh, pick me; I'm an urban Lenny!
Moe:	Look, I don't want to start a tinkling contest here ... or 
	do I?
	[cut to the alley behind the bar.  Homer zips up his 
	trousers]
Homer:	Woo hoo!
Carl:	Oh, don't look so proud.  That was wind-assisted.
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Moe gives Homer some final instructions.

Moe:	... and if anyone wants potato chips or anything fancy, 
	tell him to go to Hell.
Homer:	Can do.  Now, don't you worry about a thing.  [gleefully 
	turns on a beer tap, spilling the beer onto the floor]
Moe:	[shuts off the tap] Hey, what are you doing?  I gotta pay 
	for that!
Homer:	No, Moe, you've got it all wrong.  People buy beer from 
	you.
-- The return of the Beer Baron, "Homer the Moe"

% Moe isn't confident the bar is in good hands, but he leaves anyway. 
% Before he gets two steps away, there's a huge explosion.  When Moe
% rushes back in, Homer looks at him nonchalantly and says, "I thought
% you had to go."
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 4:51]
%
% Moe arrives at the Swigmore U campus and does some reminiscing.
%
% Meanwhile, back at the tavern, Homer proves to be lenient bartender
% despite the picture of a scowling, shotgun-wielding Moe hanging over
% the bar.  Lenny, bringing in some food, trips on a barstool.  The
% food flies into the ceiling fan, sling mayo and ketchup all over the
% place.  Homer doesn't mind, bidding his customers to "shut up and
% dance."  The gang does so, dancing on the bar as "Wooly Booly" plays
% on the jukebox.  They start slow-dancing when the song switches to a
% more romantic number.  When the needle skips, Homer tries fixing it
% like the Fonz would, by banging the jukebox.  The trick doesn't work
% in real life, and Homer ends up breaking the jukebox's glass panel
% instead.  He bleeds profusely from his cut-up hand.
%
% Back on campus, a professor is giving a lecture on mixed drinks.

Professor:	Now, can any of you tell me how much grenadine is in 
		a Cosmopolitan?
		[the students murmur, not knowing the answer]
Moe:		None.  A Cosmopolitan is made with cranberry juice.
		[the class is impressed]
Professor:	Moe Szyslak, you old glasswipe!
-- "Homer the Moe"

% The phone rings at Moe's Tavern.

Homer:	[answering the phone] Yello?
	[split screen, with the other half showing Bart on the 
	couch at home]
Bart:	Uh, yeah, I'd like to speak with a Mr. Tabooger.  First 
	name, Ollie.
Homer:	Ooh, Bart!  My first prank call!  What do I do?
Bart:	Just ask if anyone knows Ollie Tabooger.
Homer:	I don't get it.
Bart:	Yell out, "I'll eat a booger."
Homer:	What's the gag?
Bart:	Oh, forget it.  [hangs up]
-- Homer's first -- and last -- prank call, "Homer the Moe"

% Moe talks with his old professor.

Moe:		Professor, I'm um, I'm burned out on bartending, I, 
		when I first saw the movie "Ironweed" I thought, you 
		know, this is for me.  But now, well, I'm not so 
		sure.
Professor:	Nonsense!  You were born to sling suds.  The problem 
		must lie elsewhere.  Describe your tavern, in one 
		word.
Moe:		Uh, is "crap hole" one word?
Professor:	Yes, if it's hyphenated.
Moe:		Then I'll stick with, "crap-hole."
Professor:	Well, no wonder you're depressed, working in that 
		environment.  If you want my advice, beautify your 
		hole, and you'll beautify your soul.
Moe:		Nice hole, nice soul.  Hmmm.
		[the two men are standing by a pond.  The sunset 
		glints on the water]
Professor:	Look at that pond.  Why doesn't water sparkle so?
		I'm dying, Moe.
Moe:		Is, is there anything I can do?
Professor:	No, unless you have a cure for cancer.  [turns to 
		Moe, hopefully] Do you have a cure for cancer?  
		'Cause that would be great!
Moe:		I'm sorry, Professor.
Professor:	Goodbye, Moe.
Moe:		Bye, Professor.
		[the professor walks calmly into the lake and 
		disappears beneath the surface]
		Hey, don't you want to take your shoes off before 
		you go swimming?  Professor?  [realizes] Oh.  Oh.  
		Um, hmmm.
		[slowly walks away from the lake]
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Homer's in a good mood as he goes to open the bar.

I'm a-walking down the street,
   Gonna open Moe's bar.
I'm a-singing what I'm thinking,  [points to a dog]
   Hey, look at that dog!
-- Homer Simpson, "Homer the Moe"

% A Homer approaches the bar, a barstool and a TV crash through the 
% front windows.  Teen vandals must be trashing the place!  Homer
% rushes in to defend the bar, but there's no need for alarm.  Moe has
% taken his professor's advice and begun remodeling.  Homer almost,
% but doesn't quite, faint at the news.

Homer:		What are you doing?
Moe:		My professor said if I prettied up this dump, it 
		would renew my zeal.
Homer:		And it would look pretty, too.
Moe:		And now, I want you to meet the guy who's going to 
		help bring Moe's into the twentieth century.
Formico:	I am Formico, the Dean of Design.
Homer:		Hi, Formico.
Formico:	[holding a hand to Homer's lips] Uh, uh, uh -- my 
		name must never be spoken.
Homer:		Sorry.  [whispers to Moe] He seems nice.
-- Michael Payne would've been friendlier, though, "Homer the Moe"

% It's nice that Moe has his old enthusiasm back, but that means Homer
% is out of a bartending job.  He's reduced to pouring drinks and
% fetching cigarettes for his children.
%
% Eventually, the new Moe's (rechristened "m") is ready for business. 
% A long line forms in front of the cubic, glass-paneled building. 
% Two spotlights shine the "m" logo in the night sky.  Barney, Carl,
% Lenny, and Homer admire the scene.

Barney:	Wow, check out the new Moe's!
Homer:	Wow, it looks like an alien headquarters.  Couldn't you 
	just see aliens running out of there?  Couldn't ya?
	[notices that the rest of his friends have already started 
	towards the bar]
	Hey, wait up!
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Homer assumes that, as a friend of the owner, he and his buddies can
% cut to the head of the line.  The bouncer, Cecil, doubts this but
% Moe, dressed in a mod-looking suit, appears at the front door to let
% the guys in.
%
% The inside of the bar looks kind of like an alien headquarters, too. 
% The old dank and dark look has been swept away in favor of new,
% bright color palette.  There's a large bubbling water sculpture by
% one wall.  Flat-screen monitors hang on the walls and from strategic
% spots on the ceiling.  They show a repeating loop of an eyeball
% blinking and looking around.  Pop music plays from a hidden sound
% system, and some of the bar-goers can dance on the spacious floor.

Moe:	Welcome to "m," hah?  Heh, heh.  So, what do you think of 
	the new joint?
Lenny:	Wow, this place looks like it's from the not-too-distant 
	future.
Moe:	Yeah.  You like it, Homer?
Homer:	[looking at live rabbits wiggling in harnesses suspended 
	from the ceiling] Um, the rabbits are cute.
Lenny:	Eh, that one ain't moving.  [points to a still rabbit]
Moe:	[snaps, summoning an aide] Uh, change number 7.
Carl:	I don't get all this eyeball stuff.  Uh, what are they 
	supposed to represent?  Uh, eyeballs?
Moe:	It's po-mo!  [blank stares from all]
	Post-modern!  [more staring]
	Yeah, all right -- weird for the sake of weird.
Guys:	Oooh!
-- "Homer the Moe"

% The tour continues.

Carl:		Where are the barstools?
Moe:		Up there.  [points to the ceiling, where the 
		barstools are attached, upside-down]  Ain't it 
		trippy?
Homer:		Uh, whatever, just give me a Duff.
Moe:		Oh, we don't serve Duff no more.  We got a Malaysian 
		beer that's better than Duff.  It's made out of soy 
		sauce.
		[hands Homer a bottle]
Homer:		Uh, whatever.  Just give me a Duff.
Moe:		Hey, Formico!  Uh, say hello to my beloved regulars.
		[Formico comes over]
Formico:	Oh!  Hello.  [unscrews the bulb from the light 
		fixture immediately over the guys, forming a cone of 
		darkness that blots them from view]
		Moe, would you like to see some attractive young 
		models?
Moe:		Models?  Ah, oh, boy!  [he and Formico leave.  
		Before he goes, Formico signals his assistants to 
		come in and rope off Moe's beloved regulars]
Homer:		Okay -- look cool.
-- That should be easy, "Homer the Moe"

% Moe schmoozes with a trio of Russian models, who sadly admit they
% think Moe is attractive.
%
% Meanwhile, the boys try out m's oxygen bar, but they don't see much
% point in it.  Lenny gets trapped in a man-size hamster wheel.  Homer
% vows to tell Moe what he thinks of his new-fangled bar, but doesn't
% go far before coming back for more oxygen.
%
% Moe is still talking with the models.

Model 1:	After Chernobyl, my penis ... is falling off.
Moe:		And "penis" is Russian for ... ?
Homer:		[the regulars up to Moe's booth] Moe, we want our 
		bar back!
Lenny:		Yeah, this place is crazy.
Carl:		All these beautiful people make us feel like losers.
Moe:		Hey, you'd be having a great time if you'd stayed in 
		your dark spot.
Homer:		Oh, so you're ashamed of us.  Well, you turned into 
		a big phony!
Moe:		Hey, nobody calls Moe St. Cool a phony.
Model 2:	All this yelling is taking away my horny.
Moe:		Is it?  Oh, well, that's it, that -- Detmar, Julian!  
		[two bouncers come over] Throw this bum out.
Homer:		I'll throw myself out, thank you.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 12:42]
%
% To make up for the loss of his favorite pub, Homer remodels his

-- Moe Szyslak, "Homer the Moe"

% Moe walks by Homer's house, and is surprised to find that Homer's
% "bar" has drawn a big crowd.  Even his house band is impressive --
% it's R.E.M., and they're playing "It's the End of the World as We
% Know It (And I Feel Fine)."

Homer:	[singing along]
	Leonardo what-his-name, Herman Munster motorcade,

%
% Moe opens the garage door.

Moe:		What the ...?  You can't open your own bar.

Homer:		Bar?  I see no bar.  This is a hunting club.  
		[points to a sign reading, "Homer's Hunting Club"]

% The next day, Lisa is still trying to persuade her father to drop
% the hunting idea.  Homer presses on anyway and sets up a dish with

-- Relative threshold of pain, "Homer the Moe"

% Meanwhile, Homer still is on the hunt for "the only animal smarter

% identifies it as his quarry.  Before Homer can shoot, Moe scares the
% bird away with a cougar call -- and takes a bullet in the leg when
