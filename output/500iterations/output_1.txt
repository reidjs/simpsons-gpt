You can see why, I'm sorry, but I have another opinion on the matter.
Munching on a cup of tea, I asked you who the most popular person is.
But your question, "Oh, you two?" is a bit of a lie, but we've already
that.   I'm sorry, but I'm not sure who the most popular person in the
house is.  Oh, I've never really heard of anyone to name.  The only people
that I know of have names that aren't
Homer Simpson, Lisa Simpson, or Homer Simpson, are all of a sudden 
       people with names that are very, very big.
[pause]
Well, I guess that's the problem.  The more popular a
thing is, the more it attracts the attention of the
opposite sex.  If you've ever watched a show, you've seen a
kind of cartoon of a girl who is really popular.
I don't know if I like that song, but I don't like that guy.  [laughs]
Oh, I don't know what you're talking about, but I find it very
tantamount to a sexual assault.  But I don't know if you'd say "you" to me.

Well I guess I'll just say "I like that guy."
