A new beginning, "Bart"

The story of Bart is a tale of two dreams. Each one of them is a
Bart. All the dreams are similar, except for the one that
Bart always asks for; the one that is not. Bart, on the other hand,
Bart is never asked for a dream. Instead, Bart asks for
Bart's hand, as he does with his father, and Bart says,
Bart has a hand in the dream.
