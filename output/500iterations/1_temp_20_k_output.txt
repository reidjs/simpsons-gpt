In a letter sent to all the world's most powerful people, the British government said that the government was taking action to help the world through the new "human rights" system. The document is titled "The new human rights" and explains how a new social and political system will give the people of the world the right to live in dignity and freedom and to be free, with an end in sight.

The original paper was written by a former British intelligence officer, James A. McQuillan, when McQuillan was serving as the CIA's Middle East strategy chief.

The document was sent to people in the United States who were living under British military rule.

The document was first broadcast by the BBC, where it quickly became the news source of the day.

The document reads,


I was one of six children, all of whom were born in the middle of the 20th century, who, like my parents, lived in what were then known as "trendy" countries.


So we're a part of a new world order.





It's not our fault, we're the good guys.



We're the world's policeman, the world's policeman!


[applause]


The world must take the first step... [applause]

 [applause]

 [applause]

 [applause]. [laughter]

 I've been here and it's the world's policeman.



 [applause]

 [applause].

 [applause]

 [laughter]

The government has set some guidelines and regulations that will make sure that we can live on our own terms, and that no children under 15 are put to work in war zones.
I am a British citizen, a British man, I will fight for our family, because it's our right,
the right of each and every one of us to live in the way we like and where we believe in freedom and
responsibility, with freedom of religion, without religion.
I believe we have to fight for the people who have been so hard on us in our country.
And then I want to say that I'm also not afraid to take up arms, because that's the right choice.


[sighing]
[singing as he does]
And so, I'm a British soldier, and I'm a British soldier.
And so, I was born in this country, I'm a British soldier, and I'm a British soldier.
And so, the British army wants us to protect our rights and the British army wants us to protect the rights.

And it's no use, I'm a British soldier, and I live in this country, and I'm a British soldier.
And it's my family's liberty, but we don't need them in this country. [singing]
[singing and singing]
And so, I'm a British soldier.
But this is not to be. This is to save my family's lives.
And it's my family's freedom, but we don't need them in this country.


And if the British army can't take my family's liberty, it can't take my family's liberty!
[singing]
And so, it's my family's freedom, but we don't need them in this country.

And so, the British army wants us to protect their rights.

So, I'm a British soldier, I'm a British soldier, and I'm a British soldier.
And so, my family's freedom, but we don't need them in this country... [singing]
[singing]
And so, I'm a British soldier, and I live in this country, and I'm a British soldier.
And so, my family's freedom, but we don't need them in this country...
[singing]
It's my family's freedom, but we don't need them in this country.

And so, the British army wants us to protect their rights.

But what about the people of the world? They should feel the way I feel!
Oh, that's so much to ask, I don't want my family to feel that way!

The new social and political system will give the people of the world the right to live in dignity and freedom and they'll enjoy all the benefits we do as a people.
So the people of the world need to be proud!
And so, the British government will be doing everything in their power to help, to help, to help, to help the people of the world.
[singing and singing and singing]

And so, to those of you who have ever known a British soldier, I would be so ashamed of you.
You've heard them, we've seen them. And we've had to watch them, they'll

In "The Last Temptation of Marge," Bart says, "Oh my god, I'm on stage! And all the way, up, in front, all the way, the whole stage, and all the way in front."

And in his new book, "The Last Temptation of Maggie", he explains why in front of her was so "temptively optimistic."

"That the only thing that has changed for the better since those first few weeks was our friendship," Bart writes, "and our desire that it always was. [Bart's] saying we can never go back to the same time. And that, too, has changed."

And when Maggie walks out of the house, Bart says, "I think it's the first time I've ever known a man to be so optimistic."

"What is the point?" writes Lisa.  Bart says, "It's just the way the world works."

"What?  We're all happy?"

"Oh, well, but we've already lost a lot," notes Lisa.

"Yeah, I know, but the one thing I have with all these years has changed."

"You'll have to work through that later. Just like I have been with you.  And this year I'll be here, with Homer."

"Oh," says Bart.

"We can never go back to the same time," he adds, "even if I never go back.  I hope it stays that way."

Maggie walks up.  Bart asks if there's anything to the story.

The US Navy's new warship, the B-1B, is seen off from the B-21A aircraft carrier "Stargate of B-16-12" during the final two days of the US air campaign in Iraq, on June 30, 2016.

As the war effort drags on from the war in the Middle East, America's warships are becoming less and less important as the fight against the Islamic State has progressed, the chief of the US naval armaments company, who is also the head of the US Navy Office Against Torture, is pushing for more warships, and an arms control chief who is responsible for dealing with the crisis.

The warship, which will cost about $3.5 billion at an average of $1.2 million for a single model, arrives in the United States today.

The military ship, which will be called the "Rambo" or "Rambo" (Rambo is Rambo's "Rambo") was built to deal with the "Rambo-like" problems that can be found in the Middle East, said Mr. Rangel, an air force veteran.

Mr. Rangel's team has worked with the Navy, Marine Corps, and other agencies to ensure that all warships are safe from the "Rambo-like" danger as well as that the ship is safe to take to the beach.

The "Rambo" was built around a single-deck, three-man ship, with the rest of the ship with four-man crews.

The ship, which won't have any "crusades" and only a single "Rambo" crewmember, will be made from a single-deck single-wound, single-cornered, two-man, and two-man class, with the rest of the ship with five-man.

The warship will be assembled in an assembly plant located in the Navy's new base in Florida, where the "B-1" will be made out of solid steel and can be easily attached to the ship.

The ship will be used to carry out maintenance tasks in the base of Naval Base B-14 at Bagram.

When the war begins, Mr. Rangel said, the "B" will be used as a "strategic bridge'' and it will not be used as a "base" of any sort.

The war is already underway, with the US military and their partners in Europe, Asia, and North Africa preparing for a war of choice.

The US Navy is "looking at''s needs'' and has made some changes to the "B-1" in order to ensure its own safety, including "a new, more modern, and more durable" hull, which would keep the ship from falling down into the water.

The current ship's two-man crew members were to remain with it.

''We're going to keep going at it''s going to be as stable as we're going to be,'' the chief said. ''I don't know of anybody who can fly this ship, but we're going to need somebody.''

''But that's what our people, they are going to find out in time'' Mr. Rangel said. ''It's not the end of this story, but it's a start.''

But before the "B" and its crew can be "lifted down'' by the "American Marine,'' an "American military'' will be sent to the "Rambo'' to fight the "Rambo-like'' problems, he added.

There will be several military, civilian and military installations in the US, where the ships are to be used to fight the "Rambo-like" problem. The "Rambo'' will be used to carry out training and military exercises.

In Iraq, the "Rambo'' will be brought to "the battlefield", where the US air force may launch "rushing attacks to take out the [Rambo]'' and their "Rambo''

will be moved to "the battlefield" where they will be fired upon, Mr. Rangel said.

In the US, Mr. Rangel said, the battleship's new wing is the largest single-story structure in the world, and could be built in as many as 20,000 square feet, or about $8 billion, including three-quarters of the $10 billion it was originally designed for.

The US has already built "Rambo" warships, but they are in poor condition, according to Mr. Rangel.

He said the US has built one in the Philippines, and another in Hong Kong.

Mr. Rangel said the US-led "Rambo'' warship will provide a high-level military platform for US "Rambo''s" operation to fight the "Rambo-like'' issues in the Middle East.

             deadly?

We are now the second and third most popular TV show on the planet, so don't take it for granted. But don't forget to be on the lookout for the first new show on our planet. And, since it's our only TV show, you don't have to have an internet connection.

The show begins with an announcement about a "new TV show, a new show."

At first glance (and, by extension, if you haven't seen this one before, don't worry, it's a big one) the network promises that the show "will have an "unparalleled" viewing audience of over 21 million viewers, and that it will "reinvigorate our community."

But, as we head into the first half, there's an "insignificant increase" in viewers.

For instance, we saw over 9.5 million viewers in a half hour, and they were all from the USA.

At the same time, the "new show" has become "just one more chance to celebrate one of our most historic television stories, "A New Year's Eve."

The new television show is "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."

It's the first ever TV show dedicated to a girl!

The show is titled "A New Year's Eve.

It's a story of love. And of love and hope. And of hope, and of hope,
 and of hope.

The show begins with a brief introduction.

They've lost their star player for so long, they've lost their coach -- for sure, but they don't seem to have lost even the man most associated with their team.

And now, a new report from the Boston Globe reveals the most important part of all: the guy who got off his ass.

"Awwwwh," said the announcer.

It's the second-most-related word in the NFL, according to the report.

"Awwwwh," the announcer said.

And it's not just the name itself -- there has also been much talk over the years that if the Patriots are going to miss a game, they'll have to pay attention to the name.

So it's about time they did something about it.

But it's not the only piece of information, either.

The paper says that a new "narrative" is being put together about what happened in training camp.

The first report is that of former New England quarterback Tom Brady.

The second is an article from Sports Illustrated -- which is what you get if you read the paper, right? -- about what happened.

And the third report tells us that Tom Brady has been suspended five games for violating the league's substance abuse policy.

And this is for all the "hope, but no hope" that the next time we see Brady, we'll have a report on it right here:

-- The last words of the "Narrative" report, by the way, by the way
 -- and here's what the New England Patriots did at their "training camp"

So you have the "Narrative," the "Narrative," and "Narrative."

All that's left is to find the name "Tom Brady and the Game" and put the rest of it in the "Narrative."

Here's the first story from "The Fading" about what happened.

The Fading reports: Tom Brady was the coach at the time of the team's last game and his final game.

Here's a more recent story from the New England News and Record.

The Fading reports: The coach and players of the Patriots took down a billboard advertising a "Bartless" and "Amen" music.

Here's a look at the banner:

And a bit of context... It's all a bit too much for the brainiac, so here's the headline: "Narrative: Tom Brady was suspended four games for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy."

And now, here is a picture.

 "Well, it's just a matter of time until my daughter starts telling this story." ―Bart, to Bart, [in "Ain't a Man in Heaven"]

Ain't a Man in Heaven is a crime movie. It is, in many ways, the most well-known.

But it's not the only film to use the term "crime movie".
A number of movies use it. This one, titled "Mighty Man on a Wire", makes a number of uses.

I don't know about everybody, but you never know, maybe you've never seen it without a TV-watching party.

When a young man approaches a man's room and asks if he's in need, he's likely asked for a loan from the bank.
At the point the man walks past him, he asks about the bank, which is clearly a bank.
He explains the reason is, because the bank is located in a bank called the "Banks of America", which is located at the very end of the alley.

M.C. Eschew's new collection is called 'Grammar of the Book of Life.'

The book is titled, 'How to Get to the Future of Everything.'

A good book will always have a certain point where the point where the book is.
I've been on a journey to the future of everything. It's a long way from the present but I have a plan.
I've set the record straight. This book is a book of life.

It's about the future of our lives.

It's about the future of the world.

It's about the future of everything.

I've got to change the name.

I'm trying to get the title of this book.

It's about what happens when you make a stupid decision that has consequences.
I've been to the past two hundred years and I don't know which of them is worse.
So I'll tell you what.

I'm not a genius, I can't even imagine how I would feel if someone said to me, "Gramma, you're a madman and you should be ashamed of yourself."
So I'm just going to tell the story of how this crazy guy made a stupid decision.
I'll give you your story.

It was a year ago, when I met a great, beautiful woman called Marge.
My first impression was one of love, happiness, and happiness...
I was the woman Marge had always known.
And then, when my first impression was that the man I'd been with for so many years was a woman,
my third opinion was that it was just a man.
And I didn't like Marge.
She was the one who'd had her best years in life.
She was the one who'd taken care of me for me.
She was the one who taught me how to deal with a man.
And then there was the time when I was in bed with her and we went for a walk in the woods.
And I got the impression she was beautiful.
I went out to a beautiful woman with a beautiful face. I couldn't tell if she was beautiful or not.
But we went and got dinner on the couch.
And then we went back to her. And my wife was sitting with the chair, on top of my desk. 
I don't know what it was, but she got dressed and went to bed wearing a black top with pink and blue stripes behind it.
And she did a little shopping for me. The book says she bought me a black top with black stripes.  She put the book next to her.  Her hands were everywhere.
And she put the book next to her. It's not my fault I've been in the past.
No one told me about this.
I didn't know it was that way...
And then I realized that Marge, as I wrote this book, had been a beautiful man before I met her...
And then I realized that if I had known better, they would have put me back on a boat.
So I did, and she said, "I've got to change your name."
I had to change her name.
So she took my name out of it.
And she had been the only woman on the boat with a white top, and a black top.
And she asked me, "Is your name Marge?"
And I said, "Yes!
And then her body slammed into me.
And I was afraid...it's like that, a thousand times stronger."
-- "Grammar of the Book of Life"

And now I'm a woman, I'm a woman, and I'm a man. This is the book.  It's about how to get to the future of everything."

And I told her to change it.

And she said, "Why not?".
And she said, "You're wrong, you're a phony."
And she said, "I've made a mistake.
I've been to the past two hundred years and I don't know which of them is worse."
And I said, "Gramma, you're a madman and you should be ashamed of yourself."
And she said, "You'll change the name.
You can't change anything if your word is good."
And then she said, "You're wrong.
You're a phony and you should be ashamed of yourself."
And she said, "You're an asshole.
It's the way I look at it.  I could change it."

I was at the office, where I used to do a lot of research on the world. And I had a good laugh.
The first thing I did when I got up, though, was look around the room.
There were thousands of books. The best of them was my favorite science-fiction book I've ever read.

Then, I took out my notebook and tried some of the best science fiction books I've ever read.
And it was all of my favorite science fiction books.
You know, my favorite book was the first book in my entire history where a human had survived.
But then, all of my friends were dead.
I've been a human ever since then.
I can't stop thinking about those books.
I'm gonna start looking at my favorites.
I'm gonna start looking at some more books.

That's why I called the U.S. and asked, ``I will answer your question.''
And when I told them I was here to tell the nation what I learned,
that's how I got here.

Saying "We're all in a love affair!" is an almost impossible concept to grasp; we all know that "We're all in a love affair" and "We're all in love" are synonymous terms, but what if we were all in a "love affair"?

Well, if one of you is in a romance, it's important for you to know that "Love Affair" is one of the first things you'll say, right? The first line is, "I'd prefer if you were the one who was the one who came for me." And we can't forget the first line:

And, "All right, I'm here on the couch with you."

And,

"All right, I'm here on the couch with you."

And,

And "I've been watching you since the day you met me."

And,

I've been watching you since the day you met me."

And,

Homer (or "Bart" as he's known in the comic books) was a popular romantic and sexual attraction, so the idea that he would be a lover for you and your kids was one we thought we could put together.

And, the "love affair" in "Love Affair" is one of the most beautiful and engaging moments of TV, and is one of the best shows ever created.

In the comics, the show begins with a montage of the Simpsons as they walk along the streets in Springfield, but with a new camera set on, there's another, slightly different camera, and Homer can watch the montage.

This time he watches Homer walk along a busy street, not in the "love affair"-type way, but on a "love affair" that looks to make him fall in love with his partner, who has just arrived at the wedding party.

At the wedding.

And Homer stands next to the bride, who's wearing a tuxedo. But the wedding ceremony takes place in the kitchen of his house.

And,

The bridal shower in the wedding.

Homer: [on his tuxedo] Well, you know, that's not a wedding ceremony, that's a marriage, and a marriage is not just for you.

Marge: [on his tuxedo] You can't get away with that! [hands Homer a suit]

Homer: [on his tuxedo] But the wedding ceremony is for you, you must get away from us, and we'll put you on our list

Marge: [on his tuxedo] I said you, but he didn't have a wedding!

Homer: Yeah, I'm not a husband or father anymore!

Marge: What, what, what?

Homer: Oh, I'm so happy. [turns to the kitchen)

And I'd never get away from my wife!

[he picks a plate of pasta]

My family and I'll be at the wedding, and you'll be celebrating

Your wedding and my family's wedding, and I'm the father!

[his family is standing near the front door]

Dad! We're so married!

And they're celebrating, and we're celebrating our wedding! [hands Homer a glass of champagne]

And I'm not the father! The bridesmaids have all gone.

[on the wedding] Oh, yeah, she just disappeared...

[tossing the champagne]

Oh... and our brides...

We're going to be at the wedding, and we'll be celebrating our wedding! And ...

The University of Washington has released a report calling attention to a "poverty and injustice" study that was released after a decade of research. "Our country's schools have made more progress than ever before," writes the report.

For a country in which our teachers and administrators are now free to use their political power, why is there not a "progressive" or "poverty" school in the United States?

We are not a democracy, we are a system run with the full support of the people.

We know the "progressive" side of our society as the "pro-poverty" side.

But we also know that our education system has made a terrible economic, political, social and environmental mess.

And those schools, in a country where people are free to spend their time, can't afford the new, more modern, "free" technology of modern education.

It's not a question of whether the new technology is good.
It's a question of whether it is good enough. And we know that a "progressive" system of education is in the best interest of our children and the country.

And that's where it's very easy to be anti-poverty.

For example:

The only way to get more young people to use our schools is to turn in every student.

It's not true that America's schools make money off the people.

When our kids learn new skills, they are more likely to learn those skills faster.

Kids who grow out of high school have better health.

Kids whose parents don't get a good education, they spend money on booze and drugs.

Kids who grow out of college are more likely to study in the sciences and arts rather than the humanities, where "science" is an empty term, "science" a "holographic vocabulary, and science" is an empty adjective.

Kids don't grow up without reading, which is a sign that they are "too good" and "not ready".

Kids who are in a relationship have no desire to marry, and thus can't "love" any other woman.

Kids grow up without any interest in sex, either.

Kids who are "very good" or "really good" on the field of medicine have to be "very bad" on the field of history.

Kids who have no interest in politics but are "really great" on the field of medicine, will always be "very bad" on "the field" or "not very good" on the field.

Kids who do have an interest in music or literature are more likely to be "very good" on "the field"

Kids who grow up without an interest in politics, will always be "very bad" on "the field"

Kids who do grow up without an interest in political parties and parties, will always be "very bad" on the field of "politics"

Kids who want to be in a "good" college, but don't.

Kids who don't want to learn a political system, but want to learn a "good" government that's "very good" on the field.

Kids who want to be President, but don't want to be President.

Those are the lessons

The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments on a case in which a woman is charged with a crime for using a cell phone, the AP reports.

On Friday, the high court heard arguments over whether the government can bring to a jury trial a crime for using a cell phone when it is in the name of religion or a Christian.

The high court would have to decide whether a crime is "suitable" in this case in light of the recent cases in which the government has used cell phones in public places, such as churches and government buildings.

The case was set to start Monday.

The woman is charged with second-degree harassment after a call to her phone by a Christian caller in July.

She will be sentenced on June 20.

A federal judge has said the government's use of a cell phone may not be "suitable for the purposes of the Constitution."

The court is expected to hear arguments on the government's use of a cell phone when it is in the name of religion or a Christian.

The government has been using a cell phone for more than a decade.

But for the last three years, the government has used a cell phone for public events, and a court has ruled the government's use of a cellphone might not be "suitable for the purposes of the Constitution."

The government has said that using a cell phone for business purposes is not "suitable" for the purposes of the law.<|endoftext|>A man who was caught on a video being punched in his face by an officer has been arrested on suspicion of third-degree assault.

======================================== SAMPLE 73 ========================================
SINGAPORE: The National Security Council (NSC) approved a plan to build a nuclear weapon in South Korea to boost South Korea's economy and put the South on the map for development of nuclear technology.

A plan to build a nuclear weapon is being considered by the NSC to boost South Korea's economy and put the South on the map for development of atomic technology.

The NSC approved a plan to build a nuclear weapon to boost South Korea's economy and put the South on the map for development of atomic technology.

The plan was approved by the NSC, which is under the powers of the two-thirds of the government.

It will be a "big boost for South Korea's economy" and "make sure South Korea can be one of the next five nuclear power producers"

In a speech in K-pop, the NSC spoke to the country's nuclear industry.

"This is the best country for nuclear power. The economy and the people feel it too ... the nuclear power will be a big boost for South Korea's economy"

Named one of the world's 20 best nuclear power plants by the Nuclear Safety News, the North Korean government has promised a nuclear weapon that could be fired at any time.

The government and the nuclear industry have been pushing for a new system for producing nuclear power, which would be much cheaper than building a nuclear reactor, since the nuclear plants have only been at a "very low" cost.

That's why it has been decided to build a "big boost for South Korea's economy", as well as a nuclear weapon.

This will be the "worst ever" for South Korea, since the South Korea Atomic Energy Authority has been pushing for a new system for producing nuclear power. The National Security Council approved a plan to build a nuclear weapon to boost South Korea's economy and put the South on the map for development of atomic technology.

It is also the country's first nuclear weapon for use in a war.

But that's not the only nuclear weapon.

In addition to using nuclear power, the plan calls for a new nuclear fuel plant called a "polar fuel plant" to provide a way to build a nuclear weapon.

The nuclear fuel plant is also a way to store plutonium for a nuclear power plant.

The plan also calls for using nuclear power as a "crisis fuel" for a nuclear power plant, which makes it harder to use the power to build nuclear power.

But it says the power plant will not be used to fuel a nuclear power plant, the nuclear power plant will be used for a nuclear war, and the nuclear power plant will be used to store nuclear energy for "a nuclear war"

The Nuclear Safety News explains in more details.

The NSC says the nuclear fuel plant is designed to provide "a nuclear fuel for nuclear power".

The plant could hold nuclear power, as well as nuclear explosives (or nuclear weapons) like the one used in the Korean War.

The nuclear fuel plant is also used to store nuclear energy for nuclear weapons, since the "sudden destruction" of the plant would put it into a danger zone.

So far, the NSC has approved three nuclear energy power plants and one nuclear weapon, and a nuclear power plant is being built in the South Korean peninsula.

The nuclear fuel site is about 20,000 kilometers from the coast.

The National Nuclear Security Administration says it's working on developing a new nuclear power plant for use as nuclear war fuel, but this is a very expensive and "toxic" operation at this point.

So what does that really mean?

Nuclear power is an extremely powerful weapon to use against the U.S.

The Nuclear Safety News explains how nuclear weapons are used against the U.S. by using a variety of different techniques including:

- "The most powerful weapon in the world" is nuclear nuclear weapons

- Nuclear missiles fired in a "nuclear war" are a nuclear war

- Nuclear explosions are nuclear weapons

- Nuclear bombs are nuclear weapons

"This is the biggest nuclear weapon ever," said the NSC, with the nuclear power plant just one of four facilities to be built.

The Nuclear Safety News explains how one nuclear bomb could kill hundreds and thousands of people with a nuclear war, while the other three could be deadly to even the most powerful atomic weapon.

So how does nuclear war sound?

Nuclear wars.

So how do you hear me when I'm talking about nuclear war?

Well, here's a simple plan to put nuclear war on the map.

The Nuclear Safety News uses an audio clip from the documentary The Great Nuclear War to make the point.

The film's narration is a bit more sinister:

It's not a nuclear war, it's something that can happen.

Maggie: And the music festival is in the middle of nowhere!  There's a
         whole orchestra.
Homer: Oh, I can't take it.
Maggie: I want them in.
Homer: It's okay, Homer, if they want me in.  You have the right to be in
         any of this, but you're not a real person.
Maggie: And that's a shame, because we've already been in the
        hall for hours.  This is not just about us, it's all about our
        kids.
Homer: No, it's not about us.
Maggie: [to Lisa] What have you got to hide?
Homer: I've got nothing to hide.
Maggie: Homer, you're not hiding anything.
Homer: [whispering] I don't want anything to hide.
Maggie: [to Homer] Just stop acting, Homer.  We're all in the same room,
         we're all in the same room, it's all in the song.
Homer: What's wrong with us?
Maggie: It's wrong for us to be in the room.
Homer: [gasp] That's the only thing I can do.
Maggie: Oh, you're in the wrong room.
Homer: It's just a matter of time.  It'll work.
Maggie: [palsily] That'll do, Homer!
Homer: And you'll still get to be in there, Homer, and they'll get to hear you
        improvise.
Maggie: [to Lisa] I'm in the room!  I can hear you!
Homer: Oh, we're the kids!
Maggie: And I don't need you to do any improv for me...
Homer: [shakes Lisa's head] Oh, come on.
Maggie: [as she sits down] Oh, and the music festival is right next door.
Homer: We'll do the songs the way the guys do, and get you up with the

The man told the driver he was going to "kill himself" and his "friend," and that he was also going to pay for the ambulance.  The man told the driver he was going to be on the lookout for something, "in case the guy does something stupid".  The ambulance was stopped.
]
[UPDATE 2/2-5: A third story is added: Officer James Covington is now investigating the death of a man in the early hours Monday after being pulled over by police for a traffic violation.  He says that a man is believed to have punched a patrolman while they were driving to a stop sign.  Officer Covington says that the man in the photo was a man "who never stopped to stop", and "never touched or pulled over any police car".  A short while later, a man was found with a broken leg. Police say that the man did not make a "clear and logical inference", but they believe that he may have caused the accident.
[UPDATE 2/8-8:  Police say that the driver was not hit and has been taken into the hospital in stable condition.  An hour later, Officer Covington is making a detour.

]
[UPDATE 2/12-8:  Officer Covington has received "very serious calls of a man being hit and punched by the police" from the scene of the accident, and is taking the driver to the hospital.  "He is a good guy," says one of the officers.
"He's in his early 40s," responds another.  "A nice guy."
[UPDATE 3/8-8:  "A man was caught on video punching a police officer" at an intersection, apparently from the police car.  "That's the kind of person you would want to see," says one officer.  "I don't see it anymore"]
[UPDATE 3/12-8:  Officer Covington is not at the hospital.  According to a "very suspicious man" video that has been released, the man appeared to have been punched several times.  "I don't want to hear what he did to the cops" says another officer. ]
[UPDATE 3/12-8:  On this date, the man's blood-alcohol content has been determined to be .17 or above]
[UPDATE 3/17-9:  "A man's blood-alcohol content has been determined to be 0.14 or above"]

I got your old-fashioned love letters for you.
-- You, and I, in "Bart", "Bart vs. the Simpsons"

% It was your old-fashioned love letter to the people in this room, 
% "Bart vs. the Simpsons"

% In that first letter, you tell the story of Bart and 
% Homer, respectively, who are married and live happily ever after.
%
% The next is the story of Bart and Lisa, and they talk about their

% talk about the future in general.  And the next is the story of 
% Homer Simpson.  You tell the story of Bart, Bart, Bart, Bart, and Lisa.

%
% The last letter begins with a message from Homer Simpson: 

% I love you and will always love you.

-- Homer, in "Bart vs. the Simpsons"

% Homer, you know it, Homer, there are some things that 
% you've accomplished, and some things haven't.  We've learned a lot, 
      and we're making progress.

Homer, if you could be my love of your life.
-- Homer, in "Bart vs. the Simpsons"

% It seems to me, at a very young age, that Homer was born to be a man.  
% But it seems to me, you've learned a lot about people.

I was raised in a household of the wealthy and famous, but I was also 
       raised in a household of the poor, but I am also a man of many 
       qualities.  I was raised to be a man and I will always be a man.
-- Homer, in "Bart vs. the Simpsons"

% Homer, you know you're a man, and in the spirit of that 
% speech, he makes his name for himself, and I feel a little 
% more manly here.
%  The next letter starts by talking of the future...

I will go forth and do my own world-building, but you've 
I will go forth again and do my own world-building, but you've 
I won't go away.
-- Homer, in "Bart vs. the Simpsons"

%  I'll never give up on you, I shall.
%  And if we can reach the goal of my goal, then I'm 
% on to you.

       Marge, I've already met our goal, and it is, ``I'll go forth and 
                                            ,'' Homer says, 
% and then the world will fall apart on him.

        Marge, you're right to be angry.  It doesn't matter to me.
-- Homer, in "Bart vs. the Simpsons"

%                     I'm sorry, I've always been a man of many 
               qualities. I'm not a man of many qualities.

%   A man of many qualities is a man of many qualities.
%  So, if you were going to be the man, you've got to take what 
% you do have, you can't just let it go.  So, what are you doing, Homer? 

Hey, what's your name?

Homer: Marge, I just want to get you outta here and start 
thinking. I'm going to give you two hours to think, and I really don't 
want to have to think.

Homer: Marge!
Marge: Homer, we're on a journey.  We need to 
                   to start thinking.

======================================== SAMPLE 94 ========================================
A number of people have pointed out to me a couple of things about the "Bart the Kid" movie. First, I had one of these movie theater doors open that I could use, which would open and close at the same time. As a child, I was taught by the teacher that it is best to be open at home, and this was the only way. And that's why I have the door open.

Second, and this is where the "Bart" movie begins. At first, my family was excited to see the movie. Then I noticed it was so crowded, so crowded. Everyone knew that they were going to see the movie. They were going to be surrounded by their friends. They would all be staring at their screen. Then the door would open, and I could see Bart walking through the door.

So it was that we watched the movie with our friends. [Homer and Bart, dressed in their traditional white-tie attire, watch]

That's how the film started. Bart and I were in the kitchen, watching the movie. [The movie begins to play]

We have the perfect movie scene, we are perfect, our movie is in our house
And the movie is perfect. [The kids begin to watch]

[Pause. Bart and the kids are watching the movie, but he does not notice]

We are watching the movie without having to do any homework. [The kids are watching, but they are too busy watching the movie to notice]

And now the movie is complete. [The two kids stare at the screen]

[Pause]

1. If you've ever heard a song that is not a "song" it's your job to tell your audience about the song.
2. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and everyone's entitled to their own opinion, so we all feel free to choose our own opinions.
3. This is why a band needs to have a song of their own, not an opinion.  You never say "you're right" and you always point out flaws in the song, but at the same time, you always make the point at a given time.  You can't just say "Well it's a bad song, but it is the best song we've ever written", but you can point out problems.  We're not supposed to take a "realist" for granted, but I want you to know this.  The best song you can get out of a band is one that makes you feel great -- that's why we all agree on a song.  We want everyone's opinion, and I believe that's our job: to keep everyone's opinions to themselves.  I do believe in free will, and I want everyone to be free.  If I want you to feel great for me, we have to agree that I will listen to you.
