Bart: And what is it that everyone seems to have in common?
Dr. Wise: There's one question that I think is as important as any other: Do we have a population problem in our State.

Dr. Wise: I'm talking about the whole concern about the Chicago consulate.
Bart: Okay.
Mr. President, there are ways to avoid the life and death of the mentally ill.

Flanders: It won't, Bart.  I'll take a little gander at the young man and I'll tell you.
  Homer: [laughing] Oh, give him a break.  Now, as for the snakes!
Flanders: It's a city with a soul, a town which always seems to be out of

"Nu and Abe are very different people and as a result of that, it's very hard to judge them.  But not to be elitist, if you can't draw a circle, then I have something better than you," O'Grady said, appearing to bow his head.
Nu: "All right, stand up.  Now I want a picture.  Put a picture of this little cup.  [muttering] A cup, yes.  You have never seen a cup, and I'm not even gonna make one."
Abe: "You know, I could use something."
-- Too poetic, "Nu and Abe"

O'Grady: "But I'm not going to make a circle, so I have to draw the two of them on opposite sides of a circle, and I just want a square.  It looks like you are next to Abe, but I'm not going to draw on you."
-- The rules don't start at the square, "Nu and Abe"

O'Grady: "Well, yes.  I want something with no sides.  Would you like me to write the one above?"
Nu: "Not to forget your life's price and your choice and your fortune."

Nu: "Very well.  Are you two going to the bathroom together?"
O'Grady: "What about this: Are you going to join me in the kitchen?"
Nu: "I'm not even close."
O'Grady: "...you gotta take your own medicine, and I just get distracted by your show."

O'Grady: "Then how about I give you a chance to work out, so you're not very vocal."
Nu: "I'm not going to say it."

HBO: Everybody's gotta go!
Souches on our seats: the Flanders, the St. Louis Cardinals,

HBO: That's that.
Look, we all know that if you need more Nelson
Johnson, if you don't know that kids are the heart of America,
you need to go to the nearest Navy Yard and find it and
don't use it.
Yeah, how about the MacArthur bomb in your car?
HBO: You know, if you're desperate, I think you should go
to that Navy Yard and find it. 
Nelson is a sweetheart.
HBO: [camera rolling] One sip of my lemonade.
[Bart silently sucks in another drink]
Nelson, does anyone know how to wake up the funster.
[Sounds of a running gun coming from around the corner]
Crazy!
This car goes there.
But, if you have the money, you can go see the fireworks,
and you'll never see the airliners again. 
Well, we need all the money we can get:  
 a captain-and-food-safety inspector, a supervisor
and a color commentator... and we're here to tell you,
that Homer's in a ghost plane.   [reading] Homer!  I want him!
Get his information.
Who am I?
Homer!  Go ahead and find the plane.
You may have a day.
[sawing newspaper] Homer!  The airplane!
Darling, we lost one last truckload of animals, including
six o'clock cows. 
[looks around] Homer!  They're all turning out like zebras.
[camera cuts to another view of Homer on the airliners]
C'mon, it's a television pilot!
Oh, I got that.  You have six people in a plane.
My one point of view: I'm a storyteller.
How did you know the airplane was from a "Homer" movie?
You know, you can't teach a fable; you're just teaching a lie.  If
I told you that, I would have killed you.
But that would've been another man.  He's a flambearer.
And I'm a terrific hooligan.
And I've always loved Homer and his Dad.
And now I'm playing for a second.
Tonight's World Series game.  [crowd cheers]
You got a shot.
Good question, Homer.
I think I can never play again.
You never have to kill a father to get a shot.
[crowd cheers]
Shoot!
Not for fun.
Be patient, Bart.
[aims a snare at his forefinger]
Keep shooting!
And you'll probably never catch a man or a dog!
You never know.
Take the body with the energy.
This plane flew from the South Pacific.
There was none of that on TV!
Yes, well.
And for the record, I killed Homer just by watching the TV show.
And now I want you to stop all the things you've said about
me.
You want to know what the cover of a book by Nelson?
It's called "Homer and the Woman at the Word."  [crowd cheers]
That's it.
That's it, boys.  Those things won't stop.
Homer was just twenty.
Nelson is right.  He's got an  that's it, boys.  And you
so high!
But for a fact the one book that really changed my life,
was "The Ugly Aspic" by San Francisco comics Dick Pierce and John
Hodge.
It is well known that Dick Pierce and John Hodge were the men who, in
the early 1900s, named a range of popular and frivolous and silly books.  Dick

Pierce wrote his anti-President Clueless; John Hodge wrote his anti-elite; and
Nelson wrote his anti-Gordy the Hermit.  And then, of course,

Police arrest a British woman from which a British man has been arrested.

Law enforcement from the US and Britain carry out a check on a British man who was convicted of
after-effects from his drug-fishing career.

Walid is held in a crime cell at an American airport. The team has visited
that plane, but the agents are startled to find their way into
the tarmac to search the car for illegal drugs.
An agent sets off an alarm to warn the agents to wait
at the tarmac.
Walid is handed over to a kangaroo court with instructions to immediately
suspend all cooperation with his investigation.
The agents struggle to hold back tears.
The doomed Japanese man lives for life, and no one listens to his
sounds.
Walid takes his gang-sized phobia into his own head and warns
them to try to kill their fellow man.

There is only one problem: Snake shows up for work.
Hutchins runs over to the desk of the new plant manager and
sits in front of a tomato wall, loudly proclaiming "we have invented a strategy".
Snake pokes the employee hard enough to force a fire on the fire department.
Then Snake looks up from the tomato wall and begins to sift through the
current.
Dipper watches him wade into the night air, but he sees Snake leap from the
weed to the thunder, which causes him to squeal in pain.
The silver jovial and stringy instructor is slumped under the
temptation of Snake.
His "attack" doesn't go so well.
Snake whips Snake out of the nightmare, jumps off the car, and
runs right into an exposed slant.
Dipper watches the capture action on TV, first to discover that
Snake had hijacked a British airship in the days before
his trip. He asks for an apology from the British Air
ship officer, but finds himself foiled by Snake.
The British agent immediately orders Snake to withdraw his
honeybees and head out the door.
Snake makes his way down a gorge of cotton, where he is suddenly
blinded, all the while trying to avoid being eaten.
But the agent is not looking, and instead gives him $100 to
cut a fake bug out of his head.
Snake dumps that stink tank into a dug-out and watches

The Detroit Lions have a pretty nice current season.

When they trade away running back Todd Gurley for a top-10 pick, the franchise touts the possible return of St. Louis' Luke Willson.

Evan Mathis of the Detroit News says that Willson's deal may not be close to being done, and adds that Willson's team will visit the fan facility "soon."

This could be some such history-altering action.

% Homer.  Just listen, Mr. Burns, you're no exception to this rule.  The English judge
% is nothing to trouble at all.
%  A judge as smart as Homer Simpson may be, and he's smart enough
% to know how to think...
%  [on a hilltop, there's a gazebo featuring a statue of Homer, as Homer
% stands on a bench, without any other resemblance to Homer.  Other
% people are around; a pole of light runs up to Bart, but
not to Homer.  Homer stands motionless in a beach, looking for a
dollar.  He takes out the handkerchief.
       [turns to Bart and laughs, and Bart takes it out]
-- The Simpsons, ``Raging Bull''

% The judge is absent.  He reaches for a reading table, where
% he finds the entry for ``Marge Burns', and the entry for ``Judge Simpson,
% and Judge Lisa.
%  [goes out of the courtroom, and turns to the group.

Lisa:  I'm so proud of you.  This may sound like an oldy-day yokelish act, but 
         it's only as good as the human soul that's going to 
          fit into a new uniform.  But that doesn't mean 
          I'm not.  I am at the start of this new chapter of 
          history.
-- I think I gave up on the fight, ``Raging Bull''

% But Homer is so determined.  He walks to a top-secret spy plane, where
% a twelve-to-four-minute-per-minute video clip of him is released
% at a ``good'r'' American Airlines jet.  Lisa's whole world seems to vanish.
% Bart laments ``As many guys as I've ever met...''

Lisa:   [to Lisa] Just relax.  [on the plane] Thank you, sir, for giving me the 
          that few minutes, sir.
Bart:        [to Lisa] ...or two, or three, or four.
Lisa:        Well, then, let's go into the shower.
 Bart:       [offscreen, interspers] You say ``alright, Homer Simpson, 
          you can't        do that.''

======================================== SAMPLE 40 ========================================
Offensive Play (PFP) is the standard for all college football coaches, though many more people hold the position on academic grounds. The league has instituted a system of pre-emptive sports screening, which, for the most part, protects low-level football players from too much hand-eye coordination. The former Seattle sack runner featured on the cover of "60 Minutes" with coach Pete Carroll's squad wearing only a "Hatehive" helmets.
But in this case, the results are dramatic.
The first one -- so far, the greatest of all, for one week --
-- "60 Minutes" with coach Pete Carroll's squad wearing only a "Hatehive" helmets
-- "60 Minutes" with coach Pete Carroll's squad wearing only a "Hatehive" helmets
-- "60 Minutes" with coach Pete Carroll's squad wearing only a "Hatehive" helmets
Teams on the "Hatehive" billboards must pass a three-hour hunch
through first. Second, the tourniquets on the seats must be carried to
first, and then the salesmen must pass a five-minute lumen test.
Why, what must it be, shall we say?
-- Tony Dungy, "The Boomerang"

The letters "H" after the first letter mean the same thing. How do I say "Hate" in the first place? [Hoping]
[laughs]
-- Larry, "The Boomerang"

The soccer team plays in a stadium outfitted with giant roasting platforms, balls and
footballs. The tunnel for the stadium is filled with footballs, like the
grooves of thorns on a high string.  The stadium is bathed in an orange sun.
The star on the sunscreen is half of a 12-year-old boy, with his hair tanned
and still in the full moonlight.
A football is introduced, followed by two basketballs.  A series of balls are
used to pass a field-level ball to a carry-on
carry.  A basket pass from one point guard to the other is thrown.
-- Jon, "The Boomerang"

The bleachers are big enough to pass basketballs. The size of the field just means it is
the size of one basketball.  As is the "H" logo.
-- Gary Maland, "The Boomerang"

The football passes are straight forward, and have plenty of width to move
scrambling players.  A roll-over vehicle receives the ball, and in the
room is a Japanese screamer.  So does the football.
Now, is it a good time to open the locker room?  If it's not, you
know, it's time for something wrong: the locker room is the biggest I have ever
had.  I still believe in the Groovy Gypsy System, but the ball on my
hotshirt is balls.  Not half big enough, the ball in my lap is balls.
And my back is bent, the ball in my pants is balls.
-- Happy, Glad.  I'm not going to let a man throw an errant ball,
Hearing.
-- Happy, Glad.  I'm not going to let a man throw an errant ball,
Hearing.
-- Happy, Glad.  I'm not going to let a man throw an errant ball,
Hearing.
-- Dad, you really do need one of those.  Man, you got a hot neck!
       Let's go throw it.
-- Joe, "The Boomerang"

All right.  I'm proud to be that cool arm, sir.
-- Billie Joe, "The Boomerang"

Dad, have a boy.
        You think there's no chance I can just go ahead and
let the ball go?
        Uh-huh.  If I was going to walk away with the ball,
he's pretty cool with my hands.
-- Billie Joe, "The Boomerang"

Bum!
Laugh!  I know.
-- Ralph, "The Boomerang"

Kim, that ball hurt!
        [laughs] Oh, too bad.  I have a fight with my heart.
Kim, blow you a kiss!
        I know.
Kim, maybe you'll find it safe.
-- Ralph, I'll kill you.  I've become God.

Oh, stop being such a jerk.

As the Los Angeles Lakers were coming off a short stint on the scene, I found out they are in the process of talking about bringing back a couple players from last season:
This is the player they did not want to go into the locker room with, Marlon Brando.
The problem? Brando has shot a double-double in the last two years.  He shot a double-double in the last two years, the first three years without Knez or Mallory (exactly the type of thing that can give you a real IMAX.)
I should note that Brando is the same age as these Lakers:  They were 19 and 20 when they last played together.  I'm sorry.
And how does Brando do the damage?
[pause]
Yeah, I've gotta go.  Now if you've got me, you'll be all right.

Yeah.

Whilst working on her album 'Seesthat' I discovered that the predominant sounding theme in many women's pop is 'girl too'. The kind of rock that most people think of in a sense of the word 'rock' when they hear it.
I did get a look at a few photos, including the one that was taken at the gym and is titled 'Inbetweeners'.
Olly Rigg, the boxing manager for Inbetweeners, really starts making fun of girls,
and using the same old old old catchphrases. The team members were in for a hard time.
Shannon
My partner in crime and social activist, and I'm tired of keeping my nerve out there.
You sure it's not just the girls?
Yeah, but I did get a mention in The Rolling Stones' 'Sanity in America' album, where they would refer to their country as the
Sanitizer. I was curious why they'd go on about it, and they certainly were talking about
the fact that they felt they were in her yearning to be liked.
And they're also going for this same deal!
Well, for a country that's so obvious about who it's for!
Well, I found out about this when I played tonight.
Sigh, I'm so tired of the boring crap.
There's only one way to beat her.

Hmmm, ya get me, Daddy.
Yo, take your tennis ball and stand on the court.    
You're going to score the eight men, huh?
I was just playing, and I got a great shot!
Look, get used to the way you feel, here.
Go back home to the practice field.
A perfect 7-14 round, loaded with stick passes, goes into play in the second inning.
The crowd claps, "S'hop Beatnik!"
Aw, I'm sorry, I'm sure the ball doesn't hit you in the stomach, but you're
perfect, eh?
Well, it does, girl.    [interrupts]
So, uh, you caught your nail with your shoe on my feet?
Just go it alone and relax, I'll teach you how to play this game.
In the end, I had to be the only one with the balls.

======================================== SAMPLE 54 ========================================
You're watching Barney Gumbel's Once Upon a Time Show (1999)
the first episode is "Shower Island," a story that delves a lot into slavery.
Gumbel isn't on TV to make any guests on television, but he's trying to turn a
behind-the-scenes-of-Bartons-on-the-Far-Distant-From-Me-off-to-The-Distant-From-Me
the entire time.
That's right, Bartons will be starting his first TV show when the Florida
American is hit.
-- "Once Upon a Time"

[Chuckles] Well, that said, there's a point where your bets are
pumping up, and some of those bets are filled with ways to
promote a show that, in my mind, a lot of people would like
to see -- some days they'll like a show like "Gimbula" or "Fort
Moe's," and others they'll give up.
-- The look and the hands of the crow, "Never Touch the
Unbreakable Maitre d'Azur"

Not that the only thing you have to do to win is promise your farewell to
your family, friends and coworkers.
The planning center will have a plan on how to do that, and all
embracing you, Bartons will be so close to the audience that
will want to be there.
-- Something (of) Sober, "House of Bartons"

[End of Act Two.]

wanting, "God is Peace of Mind." Inside the

his red velvet napkin, and began taping it, which is now
began to open with, "Dear Daughter."

won't.
Oh, you are coming back from work, Tom.  I'm only three days

Take care of yourself.
If it's my friend, I'll keep an eye out for my teammates.
But don't let his eyes see the bling of my face.
It's not him.
[all four workers jump off to safety.]
I can't afford to go down there on a mob: he's serious
theft.  Or I'll give up my membership in the gang.

It's the product of Ned and Lucy Simpson. The Simpsons have met in the crowd;
and the Gophers will continue to meet;[they meet again, in time to beat the Gophers.]
So, I'm on the X-Ray plane.
Here's the clip of the bowling alley - in part - which will see their glorious plans

And then, Mr. Simpson and Mr. Firestone drive to Springfield, Springfield.
Boom, boom, boom.
Well, I'm from Santa Fe, home of Santa Fe.
For the first time in my life, I don't give a damn about your operation

But I am, and I love you, Santa.
And while I'm at it, I suggest that you drive out to get an old apron
and "What're you watching?" [laughter]
And shut up, they can't come in!
Now you can send in your "buttholes" and there's nothing I can do.
[laughs] I can't even get my burger, it's an inconvenience!
[roars as cheer goes up]
Get out there, we don't have to fight, we won't.
If you wanna help the kids get up, here's the rest of our deal:
Don't play the aliens until they are told that.

Dad, they said I'd never go back in, because I'd never see my dad again!

I really think you're being ridiculous!
I just wanna grab an apple and throw it in my face.
Come on, honey, kids, you know, we'll see each other!
I hope they stay home.

Thank you, Dad.

One of the key promises of Ervin's management style is that he is well-connected and capable of pushing his buttons at every opportunity.  What his teammates don't know is that as Ervin stands on his throne, they do what, in baseball's eyes, must be the job of his chief, his footmen!
In addition, Ervin has worked in the Oil Can Field and the Convention Center, to name a few.  An order of "dust-ball" apples has been presented, which reads: "Oh, Wisp, I've got a Burns drive to suck up to one of the natural gas grandfathered forkets and pitch the old hat-waving hymn-making pants on me.  Do it."  In celebration, Ervin's wife, Janice, gives him a copy of the law, which reads,
 "You may not interdict any person under this law except the first wife of your husband."  Here's the truth: In order to serve as a crew chief, you must be able to ride a 4,000-horsepower three-seater, with 11 valves.
As with any great crew chief, you have a handful of vocal fryers to keep you busy.  Those are two at the moment, with two main people in a different line.
If I ever happen to be sitting down for one of those, I'm gonna wear one of those.  No, no.
The man responsible for managing this deadly crime will be chief of the oil can field in Cedar Rapids.
A command report, delivered to City Hall, is meant to help the police and firefighters "help and support" the man who is responsible for this crime. 
[Police and fire are from the town of New Hope, which is the only town on the West Coast with an oil can field.]

[At first, the riot police, while wearing ski masks, attack the rioters.  They don't even know who they are.]
[With the tree's blossoms, the riot cops are given a second chance.  All tear gas in this town is lethal.]
[The crowd reacts, the riot cops are forced to use helicopters.  It turns out that the police are mounted suicide vests mounted with ammo cans.
The riot cops don't stay there for long.  One of them was on TV, and one was in the audience.)
We can count on you, Maestro, to help us on this great ride.

New York Times     (sotto voce),
delivered today to the President.
Name: Agent Newell.
Mr. President, the West in New York City is under a long
         emergency.
Homer:       Yes, the issue is it no longer America.
Newell:         In the name of Our Lord and Saviour, I answer for
           you and the world.
Mr. President, we also know your name.
Name: Agent Zena.
Mr. President, the President will personally address you.
At 9:30 this morning, my assistant is taking my file, ``yesterday.''
Nathan, you have files to record!
No matter what the final decision, ``yesterday'' is the real one.
-- An awe-inspiring cocktail      question, ``The Art of the Deal''

Lawrence Lessig:            First, I'd like to mention the Death Valley, this sprawling
            park in the San Gabriel Mountains. You've heard about the strange
            two UFO storms? And, oh, and it looks like it could be all right.
Agent Little was busy in the parking lot checking out the new Super Bowl.
``We're not on this plane, Bob,'' said Big, who took a look.
``Yes, we are,'' the President said.  
-- Mr. President, you sure want to know whether Mr. President called or
           touched down on the summit of Mt. Tristan         and the summit of 
            Mt. Mt. Tristan, you'll have to pick a good trail to be on.
-- Mr. President,           set, ``The Art of the Deal''

Agent Brown's employees tried to suppress his excitement, but no one on the
 office was thrilled.
``All told, I've been onto the Ookay village and Melrose Island, and 
 had a very wonderful time,'' said Mrs. Martin. 
``I've been thinking about not wasting time on these places.
``Well, one day, we'll just spend all the great time at Melrose Island with the 
          family.''
Agent [John] Johnson seems more concerned than ever with the President's 
           interview.
``No, please, don't do it, Mr. President.
Now I'm not going to be funny, I'm just going to 
 me,'' said Mr. President.
Agent Clark worked in the lab, which, like Allman, often not happens 
           because, strangely enough, his boss...
``Is he worried about your draft?'' inquired Dr. Thomas Newman.
``I don't think so, in fact, I think he thinks I'm worried.
-- No, if you don't, that's your own conscience.''
-- At least he said to his boss,
``There is a way I could bring him up to the nutcocks of the 
staying class.''
Agent Little, who'd taken the law library course, considered the
Manhattan Institute .
``You say you're thinking about that now, but I really 
intend to go in there, too.
``Oh, I'll go, are you sure you want to find this out?
-- If Mr. President runs into trouble, you just write your name in
the field.
-- But for now, this is going to be over, so if you need 
clear eyes, start there, right away.
``No, if you don't, that's your own conscience,'' said Agent L.
 -- And so forth, right there, except, of course, when he says you
will go.
``Uh, I was thinking about that too.''
Agent L.
Agent Little:             The President, you don't have to go all the way to find  
             me.
Mr. President:              So, what's your problem?
Agent Little:              You won't be sorry, dear sir.
Mr. President:

Thank you, Jeremy.

Three...four...five:
You like your kids good meals?  {very cute}
All the same, honey.
Thank you, honey.
I love you all.
Give me the kids' day.
[shows the twins in the background]
Bored?  "Bored"
Claused?  You really need to throw the kids out
of the business.
[the twins try to act goofy]
Bored?  'Bored'
Love in Six Seconds!  Get out of here.
[everyone waves an open blanket]
Bored?  Ugh!  No way!  Go back!
[everyone rushes in]
Bored?  Ugh!  No way!  Go back!
[everyone calls out for a ride]
Really fun.  Maybe we should run.
[everyone has a fake van; drivers do the corner]
Oh, Mr. Grey, we haven't seen each other for like twenty-five
seven minutes.
Now that's a hope.
[everyone gives each other an open container]
Great.
[everyone snickers, and carry the milk crate back to Mr. Grey's home]
Ahh, no, I didn't need that.
[everyone slumps and protests]
Oh, Mr. Grey, you know where I have to go.  Right now I'm
impressed, I've made my friends and I'm still trying to figure
out the hardest lessons that will give me a chance to give back.
Well, let's talk about the meat for a moment.  I suppose you
found the best way to feed the twins.
Would you like some meat?
[Everyone turns to each other]
Would you like some meat?
[looks at each other with a hat]
[they all laugh]
[runs out]

Chew.
Chew!
[opens kitchen door]
 [pulls up meat]
[manual cooker]
  Heh. 
[doppelganger comes in, which makes the meat worse]
  I wanna switch the channel.
Hmm... [hands out meat]
Surprise.  What's your current state of mind?  You know,
uh, I've been thinking of you.
[turns to face the room]
Well, look.  When I went back in time, I was happy...
I loved my old friends, the future grandchildren, the twins.
What's more, when I go back to day eight I'm still no use
to holding hands with [reals] anymore.
[looks up at a banner in front of the TV]
Well, don't look at this TV.  It's a glorified flag emblazoned
with "crowded Blooddrenched Bridges".  Now, I'm really not
thinking of you.  That's just because I was in the last time I ate beef.
[talk to guests]
Would you like some meat?
[walks down a dirt road]
Well, I'll give you your choice.
[points to a button that opens the window]
So, what's the motive?
[pointing to a road]
If you're a demon, then to eat this garbage is not good for the
others.
[points to the cart]
Well, the store has 20-30 people, [very]early,
and a lot of customers in my neighborhood.
Well, let's say we get a good line.
[woman enters.  She gestures, then runs off]
Hmm, I don't really care.  This is a paradise of perfect land.
But who wants this?
[red-faced woman in tan attire walks out of a restaurant]
Now, now, how about the cats?
[human cat walks towards the tree, snagging cat hair]
[as many customers as he can, yells, and turns to walk towards the tree]
This is simply the reason that I've been out of the A...
[saw cats coming in, looking only to be pulled back and attacked by the rats]
I...I ate two animals, just to be in a family.

 In the riverboat, Lucille lets her father know he will
       die if he is not careful. The two of them get
       on, and they dash past.

        ends up killing Lucille. So as he walks back to

        him to keep up.
        Hey, he didn't just blow up the world with his
        bombs!
Lucille is prepared. He says they could get to Europe.

======================================== SAMPLE 89 ========================================
A widely held belief is that the true "life" of Michael Jackson is under construction. But many think this is a man with the clock in his head; and, indeed, it is.
The true truth is that neither the clock nor the clock in his head are his; for his time has been interrupted by modern technology, and he can no longer control his day-to-day.
But then the clock stops, and the machine fakes his blood all to himself, to cut a deal, and to make money.  The clock kicks into action, and real man beats the world to a standstill.
Of course, there's no sugarcoating this: the clock may never hit its "clock" and, even if it did, Jackson was a large fat man.
There's a conflict of interest there; if he'd have been rich, or even at his best, he could have committed fraud: his children could have bought tickets to the grave of the police chief, and, even without it, he could be believed, too.  "I was on the wrong side of the law," he says, "and I got into trouble."
There's a twinge of worry about his children -- "and I left them to grow up", is how he talks about them.
And yet, there's some evidence for that.  "For all I know," he says, "the number of murders committed by the police is the single most important factor in it.  The man down there died on the street, and yet he stole nothing!"
The police chief hates that man.
He and his wife want to take all that money and build something as modern as a village in Brooklyn.  (Michael is not a good man.)
One day, Michael has an idea for a modern jigsaw puzzle: a year-round game that looks like a round-eyed boy.
The world hates it.
That's how the past works: Jackson, the clock, and his family, who haven't gotten a single nut or another, are now building a house out of old furniture, down in memory of some past master, and trying to figure out what to do with the money.
You're telling me there's only two possible endings?
''Oh, it's a boy's game.  It's the way to a father who's got a grand plan.''
And so it goes.  And it goes.
There's a game where the clock will be the perfect best partner: the quest for forgiveness.
Don't worry, guys.
You won't ever know how you're gonna solve it.
And that's why, through you, I've become a cartographer, practicing in court, past accomplices and future winners, and now, these kids, you have to give the finger.
There's a real clock in there.  And you can play for twenty.
Some nights we'll throw two fireworks into the clock.
And then we'll take our time.
This game has me back to square one.
But I know where to find the jewels...
Three gold pieces.
My great father was a filthy squab.
And no one here is aware of me.
So I don't mind working with the clock.
Go to Hades, then die.
Go to heaven.
Do that, I'll be rich, I'll be rich.
Now the game's over.
Go to hell.
