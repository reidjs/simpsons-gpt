Syfy's The Star-Spangled Banner will be getting a lot of attention, but for now, it's a Simpsons-esque comedy that didn't even have a Star-Spangled Banner script. The show went on to lose both an Emmy and a Best Original Series nomination for it, and after a bizarre report in the paper, it was finally cancelled.

Oh, but the Simpsons won the hearts and minds of America.
-- The Simpsons, "The Star-Spangled Banner"

Syfy says "Homer and his sleazy buddy don't even know it's a Star-Spangled Banner."
-- Marge and her overjoyed best friend, "The Star-Spangled Banner"

% A clattering noise kicks in, and Homer walks to the chair.  The chair
% has a towel covered in beaded wires.  Homer tells Bart to put it on.
%
% The next scene shows Homer hanging upside-down on the floor, in

% able to hold it.  Homer doesn't have the strength to carry it.  Homer falls
% on his back.
%
% The camera pans to a smaller screen, where a Hawaiian-shaped
% bowl is protruding out from the chair.  Homer lands on the table,
% clutching his hand.  Homer picks it up, and holds it up with a bottle
% behind him.  The camera pans to a box of cigars.  Homer takes
% a sip of a cappuccino.  
%
% The camera pans back to the seats, where Homer is seated in
% the chair, arms crossed, elbows behind his back, face down.
%
% Homer doesn't get up from his chair and begins to fall.  He shudders and gasps
% as the camera pans back to the group of heroes that are going to fight
% in Springfield.
%
% At the gymnasium, Homer sits with a plate of steak.  Bart
% hangs out with the crew.  The camera pans over him to a bunch of
% Brazilian dancers.  They are all dancing like crazy.  A dancing
% pole pole dances on a drum.  Bart grabs a microphone.

% play with a swivel hoop.  Homer asks Lisa to play with the hoop.

Lisa: Oh!  I bet she'd say, ``I bet she'd say''.  Maybe, it would just make
