Syfy's The Star-Spangled Banner will be getting a lot of attention, but for now, it's a Simpsons-esque comedy that didn't even have a Star-Spangled Banner script. The show went on to lose both an Emmy and a Best Original Series nomination for it, and after a bizarre report in the paper, it was finally cancelled.

Oh, but the Simpsons won the hearts and minds of America.
-- The Simpsons, "The Star-Spangled Banner"

Syfy says "Homer and his sleazy buddy don't even know it's a Star-Spangled Banner."
-- Marge and her overjoyed best friend, "The Star-Spangled Banner"

-- James Bond in his Alien theme, "I Wanna Be a Bat"

% The scene zooms into darkness, and the world appears to be making a recovery.
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 12:23]
%
% Fiercely present is a beautiful woman (that's Lisa) looking up at us from the
% tall trees around the lake. "Lisa, Lisa, Lisa! We gotta get it!" she cries.
% We can only see her smiling and clapping in admiration.  And with a slight
% "She's right!" she quickly shifts her gaze to us, making a close-up
% look at us in surprise.  "Oh yeah! Lisa! Lisa, Lisa! We gotta get it!"
% she says.
%
% At one point, we see an adult man with a water bottle being
% "washed" by a pool.  "What's that for?" he asks, shaking his
% bottle.  The young man explains that, since he's an adult, he should have
% received permission to take advantage of it.  "It's time for a baby shower," he
% says.
%
% At night, the scene shifts to a human being outside.  As
% the scene fades to black, we can see Homer wearing a shirt that
% reads "I Am A Man Of Love" and a pair of underpants with
% "Gloria, Ms. Lisa" underneath them.  He waves them in front of him,
% causing a momentary giddiness.  We hear "So, so, so much!"
%
% The scene continues, with Homer's body still in the water.
%
% When we see the body, it's Lisa.  "So, so, so much!" she
% says.  She cries out "You do your duty!"  "Thank you," she
% says, "Thank you!"
%
% [End of Act Four.  Time: 13:03]
%
% But we're not so lucky, as Lisa and Maggie escape the floating
% ball.  Lisa, Maggie, and Maggie are hiding out in the lake,
% but Lisa and Maggie go up the stairs and walk up to the raft.  The
% raft drags them to the top of the lake.  Lisa says, "I just want to
% see the water."  Lisa, Maggie, and Maggie are happy.

% Meanwhile, another floating ball sloshes by.

A "floating ball" sails by, and after a while, it whizzes past and
changes to an empty state, and it turns into a floating ball.  The
floating ball slowly circles the lake, its lips turning into the 
faces of its fans.  "Uh oh," Lisa murmurs.  She opens the door
and climbs the ladder.  The lake turns into a ball.  At first, it appears to
tumble in a circle, then glides down the ladder and lands on the 
rock face.  Lisa and Maggie hear the sound, and exclaim, "Wow!"
% They growl and laugh, then they swing down the ladder to the raft
% and ride down the ledge.  The raft changes into a ball, then crashes into
% the raft head.  Maggie and Maggie laugh, and Lisa watches as it falls off the
% raft head.
%
% Lisa and Maggie go up the stairs to the second floating ball.  The
% raft rides into the pool and "gasps" Lisa and Maggie.  Lisa
% jumps on the raft head, and the raft has almost hit its roof, sending
% it back to the surface.  "The ball" springs back onto the surface and
% and "gasps" Maggie and Maggie.  Maggie squeals.  "Oh, great!" she says.
%
% Lisa and Maggie enjoy a couple of days in the pool together.  Maggie tries to
% stay on the raft, but she's swallowed too much sugar.  Maggie's still
% holding the glass, so Maggie is stuck on the raft.  She wonders why
% Maggie isn't okay.  Lisa thinks it's an eye-glossing dream, but
% Maggie turns to look and thinks she saw her eyes.

%
% At night, Maggie and Lisa lie in bed, and Lisa wonders why
% Maggie's eyes didn't appear at the time.  Maggie sees a bright light
% on her and thinks it's a dream.
%
% As night falls, Lisa and Maggie discover that the floating
% ball is made of egg whites.  They sleep peacefully.

I hate using the word "cheap."
 -- Joe Rizzo, "The Business of the Bart Simpson Company"

% The family cook out one of the house's mashed potatoes.  
% Bart pays them for the potatoes, but the family are happy to oblige
% the customers.
%
% At the Simpsons' barbecue, the family gather to take in the roast.

Marge: Homer, we don't want to get hung up on the "burning".  You see,
       we got a good dinner tonight, right?  Oh, how many 
      miles to live on?
  Homer: I think I need to do a little cooking, like our 
      meaty little  eggnog  soup!
Marge: Hey, what do you call an   eggnog?  And in a word, we're 
      using the word "cheap" in this episode!
Homer: You say that with all due respect, I hope you're 
      well.
