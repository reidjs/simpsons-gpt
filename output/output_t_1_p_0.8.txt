Syfy's The Star-Spangled Banner will be getting a lot of attention, but for now, it's a Simpsons-esque comedy that didn't even have a Star-Spangled Banner script. The show went on to lose both an Emmy and a Best Original Series nomination for it, and after a bizarre report in the paper, it was finally cancelled.

Oh, but the Simpsons won the hearts and minds of America.
-- The Simpsons, "The Star-Spangled Banner"

Syfy says "Homer and his sleazy buddy don't even know it's a Star-Spangled Banner."
-- Marge and her overjoyed best friend, "The Star-Spangled Banner"

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 12:23]
%
% Fiercely present is a beautiful woman (that's Lisa) looking up at us from the
% tall trees around the lake. "Lisa, Lisa, Lisa! We gotta get it!" she cries.
% We can only see her smiling and clapping in admiration.  And with a slight
% "She's right!" she quickly shifts her gaze to us, making a close-up
% look at us in surprise.  "Oh yeah! Lisa! Lisa, Lisa! We gotta get it!"
% she says.
%
% At one point, we see an adult man with a water bottle being
% "washed" by a pool.  "What's that for?" he asks, shaking his
% bottle.  The young man explains that, since he's an adult, he should have
% received permission to take advantage of it.  "It's time for a baby shower," he
% says.
%
% At night, the scene shifts to a human being outside.  As
% the scene fades to black, we can see Homer wearing a shirt that
% reads "I Am A Man Of Love" and a pair of underpants with
% "Gloria, Ms. Lisa" underneath them.  He waves them in front of him,
% causing a momentary giddiness.  We hear "So, so, so much!"
%
% The scene continues, with Homer's body still in the water.
%
% When we see the body, it's Lisa.  "So, so, so much!" she
% says.  She cries out "You do your duty!"  "Thank you," she
% says, "Thank you!"
%
% [End of Act Four.  Time: 13:03]
%
% But we're not so lucky, as Lisa and Maggie escape the floating
% ball.  Lisa, Maggie, and Maggie are hiding out in the lake,
% but Lisa and Maggie go up the stairs and walk up to the raft.  The
% raft drags them to the top of the lake.  Lisa says, "I just want to
% see the water."  Lisa, Maggie, and Maggie are happy.

% Meanwhile, another floating ball sloshes by.

A "floating ball" sails by, and after a while, it whizzes past and
changes to an empty state, and it turns into a floating ball.  The
floating ball slowly circles the lake, its lips turning into the 
faces of its fans.  "Uh oh," Lisa murmurs.  She opens the door
and climbs the ladder.  The lake turns into a ball.  At first, it appears to
tumble in a circle, then glides down the ladder and lands on the 
rock face.  Lisa and Maggie hear the sound, and exclaim, "Wow!"
% They growl and laugh, then they swing down the ladder to the raft
% and ride down the ledge.  The raft changes into a ball, then crashes into
% the raft head.  Maggie and Maggie laugh, and Lisa watches as it falls off the
% raft head.
%
% Lisa and Maggie go up the stairs to the second floating ball.  The
% raft rides into the pool and "gasps" Lisa and Maggie.  Lisa
% jumps on the raft head, and the raft has almost hit its roof, sending
% it back to the surface.  "The ball" springs back onto the surface and
% and "gasps" Maggie and Maggie.  Maggie squeals.  "Oh, great!" she says.
%
% Lisa and Maggie enjoy a couple of days in the pool together.  Maggie tries to
% stay on the raft, but she's swallowed too much sugar.  Maggie's still
% holding the glass, so Maggie is stuck on the raft.  She wonders why
% Maggie isn't okay.  Lisa thinks it's an eye-glossing dream, but
% Maggie turns to look and thinks she saw her eyes.

%
% At night, Maggie and Lisa lie in bed, and Lisa wonders why
% Maggie's eyes didn't appear at the time.  Maggie sees a bright light
% on her and thinks it's a dream.
%
% As night falls, Lisa and Maggie discover that the floating
% ball is made of egg whites.  They sleep peacefully.

I hate using the word "cheap."
 -- Joe Rizzo, "The Business of the Bart Simpson Company"

% The family cook out one of the house's mashed potatoes.  
% Bart pays them for the potatoes, but the family are happy to oblige
% the customers.
%
% At the Simpsons' barbecue, the family gather to take in the roast.

Marge: Homer, we don't want to get hung up on the "burning".  You see,
       we got a good dinner tonight, right?  Oh, how many 
      miles to live on?
  Homer: I think I need to do a little cooking, like our 
      meaty little  eggnog  soup!
Marge: Hey, what do you call an   eggnog?  And in a word, we're 
      using the word "cheap" in this episode!
Homer: You say that with all due respect, I hope you're 
      well.

======================================== SAMPLE 35 ========================================
Talk about a "beloved Simpsonsman"! Homer got two copies of The Simpsons in a five-pack, but they were missing out on the good old-fashioned punchline of the school. Bart, having had a huge fall in, left the school to spend more time with his father, who returned in time to the early days.  Moe, on the other hand, couldn't get out of bed at night to leave Homer.
Now, I'm not going to talk about why the bullies were so desperate to keep Bart away from school.  I think the good old-fashioned "dog fite" gave them the sneaking feeling that Bart was trying to get him out.  But, I think that's how they got the school to pay for the trip, even if that means you have to have a much better plan.

There's a dearth of talking heads on TV who won't bring up the many large-scale murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed kind of murders.
But today's piece, in which Maureen, George, and I address all those who are concerned with the needs of women and youth.
In our case, we're the subject of a gory scene of a crime scene with blood and human waste in its wake.
Let's start with the police department that dumped this human waste, under a $1 million-a-year contract.
So, why does it have such a low-hanging fruit?
Well, they say it's because they have to deal with women in the state of Mississippi.
Because, their job is to search for scapegoats.
So, it's up to Maureen, the president of the Mississippi State Board of Theology.
For you we must answer the question: "Why should we care if there are other women in the state?"
And, I presume, if anyone can stand to use their talents, the chance is yours.
What are your thoughts on the subject?
My only concern at this point is with our entire state.
Let's hope that this little matter can be taken care of.
Now, when we finally settle this very real question, "Why do we care if there are other women in the state?"
Now, let's go to our friend, Maureen.
Maureen: Wow, very interesting.
George: It's the latest murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed kind of murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed kind of murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed-kind of murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed-kind of murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed-kind of murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed-kind of murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed-kind of murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed-kind of murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed-kind of murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed-kind of murder-of-instructions-the-oppressed-kind of murder
The price of a funeral home is a few cents, while a boat you saw in the water, your father, the W.W. Marriott,
mimics a figure in the sky.
Now, that price would be high, if the killer ever made it to the death scene.
But, you see, that's not what happens.
That's just another excuse, but, I'm afraid that you'll be disappointed.
You know, if we can get a funeral home, they can start a crisis.
Well, I'm sure it'll start some other way, if we do.

Bumbling Over the Library of Congress
The Great War of 1812 started in Virginia, and when the country's civil war broke out, its citizens began using the library for their amusement.
It was an unfortunate side effect, but the time went by quickly, and in the spring of 1812, the Library of Congress
forgoed its permanent storage space and decided to have a competition to see who could show the most
violent of women.
In the spring of 1812, the four winners of the competition were chosen by a select
list of the 15 national-level professors.  Some of them, like Edna and Agnes,
Homer, became star-studded guest stars on the show.  Homer, an unhappy college student,
was selected as the "most bloody man in America."  The competition was held in
the famous Chief Court Room, and during the show, Homer
was considered "who could stay awake all night"?
                                      
Well, now let's get to the point, which was the point.  The winning winner of the competition
was Bart Simpson.

Last week, when I read an article from the major news news outlets, I thought it would be fun to do something similar with what we're doing in the L.A. Times, but after a few drinks I realized it's not exactly what I'd have been hoping for.

To quote from The First,

There is one way to do this.

[more content]

The problem is that, if you take a few new dimensions, you can't just run the print in.
-- The same article, "Batteries Are Failing The L.A. Times"

There is one way to do this.
-- The same article, "Batteries Are Failing The L.A. Times"

At a special audience meeting for the L.A Ace, Mayor Stern addresses the audience.

So you want a paper that gives us advice?
-- Stern, Nelson Mandela, "Batteries Are Failing The L.A. Times"

An article in the L.A Ace has a slightly different take on our new slogan, and that's it.
It reads,

"The great media empire has come a long way since the heyday of the free press.
In today's world, public opinion is different.
In today's world, people don't take anything for granted.
And if they do, that's what people want!"
-- Nelson Mandela, "Batteries Are Failing The L.A. Times"

This is it.
-- Nelson Mandela, "Batteries Are Failing The L.A. Times"

This is a piece that was written in just about every age group. And it shows what life is like in this era.
 -- Nelson Mandela, "Batteries Are Failing The L.A. Times"

But, this article from The Times is also a little different.
In short, it's saying that our day-to-day life is not better than it was a few years ago.
But it also tells us that people really, really think it's just a story, and people think they know it's true.
 -- Nelson Mandela, "Batteries Are Failing The L.A. Times"

-- Nelson Mandela, articulating his thoughts on how he thinks life is different now, "Batteries Are Failing The L.A. Times"

This article is for those who have to tear themselves away from the idea of "real life."
 -- Nelson Mandela, "Batteries Are Failing The L.A. Times"

No matter what they say, the work is still important.
They say there's one life of pain, one life of strength, and you will live a few hundred years before the day you die.
But, this piece takes it to another level.
This is all about giving people what they need -- real and in-depth.
The best thing you can do with this piece is to put a lot of thought into it, rather than just start with a canned example.
And I think it's worth it to give you an idea of the kind of effort and effort that you need to put in to do the writing.
You see, I like my job, I think it's important, and I don't think the better part of that is my life.
 -- Nelson Mandela, articulating his thoughts on how he thinks life is different now ET-21

But, if you look at it a little bit further, it's still not as much about true life as it once was.
Now, I've got one thing for you, which I do think is important to us -- and this is one of my little things.
-- Nelson Mandela, "Batteries Are Failing The L.A. Times"

-- Nelson Mandela, articulating his thoughts on how he thinks life is different now ET-21, ET-23

What's your opinion on the most important word you've ever heard?
-- Nelson Mandela, calling for the influence of the word.

And now, if you've been following this, you'll know that I've been busy with this.

Here's an interesting little piece about the word influence:
