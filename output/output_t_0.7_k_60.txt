It seems a few of us are just doing what "real" American citizens do all day long: they sit down to dinner, eat, and watch TV.
...but there's a catch: the TV is a big, ugly, and very expensive piece of crap.
A TV is a TV that has been ordered by its creator.
When Mr. Krabappel shows up, Mr. Krabappel is thrilled to find that his TV is getting a reprieve.
Homer and Lisa talk about the TV's history, but Mr. Krabappel is also pleased to see that the TV is "very much worth paying for".
Homer begins to regret his decision to purchase the TV, but a TV is worth a lot of money to him.
Homer realizes he's not going to be able to afford the TV's $60,000 price tag, so he decides it's time to buy one.
Homer has a list of TV's he can afford, including the entire family.
