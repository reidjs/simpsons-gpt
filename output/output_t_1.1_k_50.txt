[to Lisa]    Hi, I'm Lisa Simpson. I'm an instructor at Your Springfield-
      Marge Simpson Academy.
Karen:   Homer, how's my morning?
Homer: Very little.                  Well!    I do not have, you know, a big
                   breakfast.   What are you doing?         Me and you?
[looks to Lisa]     I am running.  What could you say?       We're supposed to          run again?
Homer: That's not what I said.    Maybe just a little bit more.
Lisa:           You're a student of history at the academy, aren't you?       Yes you are.
Homer: Sure.   I suppose there are some things that make me do 
            not only homework but instruction. 
-- A student of history at the academy?      ??
   Lisa:                                        What did you learn, Homer?
Homer: I learned the history of the United States of America.   In
                my class, we're taught it and we'll 
              teach you about it.  That's             I think I teach 
                  those days.                 That was a lot of lessons 
                          with us.

-- Homer's history?           Bart's history?   Homer, I don't think you, Bart, know

                                         smart teacher, I am just glad
      Lisa is such a hard-working teacher, the students -- like
     them -- are too happy.   A little bit of work is needed though. 
-- The one thing Lisa hates that nobody likes,
   Simpson,
     Lisa:       Okay, we're right.  It's still a small class, but we're 
        knowing more about that world and our own future.
Homer:        [sighs]       You know, for me, school is everything.  My 
       students are the brightest, brightest students I've ever heard.
Lisa:         You know what they say about being smart?  Smart students are 
                              stupid teachers!
-- And it's just the beginning, Bart,

    Bart was at a business lunch meeting and thought, 
                   Lisa was being sarcastic.  Maybe she 
                          is being funny?

Marge:  You've never met Lisa before, yet you say you don't mind.
         [Kenny walks by]
Jenny:  You've only known it since we were little. It's hard to believe
         when you remember all your good feelings.
          No one knew. Lisa was a freak of nature, maybe!
          Oh, it just seemed crazy for her. I wonder if she
         can come back?
          [looks to Bart] Oh, she's a wild animal. She did
          make a mistake. She fell down a chimney.  Bart
          and I had to stop her.
Bart:  Oh-no.  I did that.
Lisa:  Oh.  Oh, oh. I thought we ate him.
Bart:  Oh, well I guess.
          [hides] I got no love.
Lisa:  Oh, well, well.
Bart:  Oh, I got no love.

Lisa:  Oh.  Oh.
Bart:  Oh.  Ooh, no love. (Hanging by a
          fence)

Homer:   Yumm.
Lisa:  Oh, it's just.  The family, they're just getting
           their asses back.
Homer:    Uh-huh, you'll find out soon enough.
Bart:   Oh well, we'll see you soon, Homer.
Homer:   Yup.  We'll see you soon, Homer.
 Lisa:    Yeah, we'll see you soon.
Homer:   What are you talking about?  Are you in love or are you in

    crazy; a couple of hundred miles away they can eat you!  I, a
                  kid of a hunch.  I didn't think of it.

                         We're going to eat some dogs, Homer. 
Homer:     Yum.  Uh, yes, I didn't think of it -- there's two dog
                                             boys.
Yay!  We'll eat a few kids now, just for fun!
                                  Yummy.  Okay.
Homer:     So, here we go again.
Yuh!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!

In order to put up with the high and the bad, we'll be getting ready for them all in the "Warm" section below.
Warm Episode:
"The Great American Fall"
In that time, one of the greatest events of our modern era has happened:
Warm-Won, Warming-Won. Ever since we invented the automobile, it's been with us for more than 300 Years,
with

The first electric car was built, and
The last electric car was built...
Boomerang ...
BOO! I mean, the two best cars in the history of mankind.
But, of course. ... a lot of things have changed since then.
-Boomerang, "The Great American Fall"

A great deal has changed because there is now
some sort of change in the world.
This has turned out to be the great American Fall....
Fate? ... to tell you the truth, I still think the present is... 
Hmmm. What I like to think of today's world isn't so much what the past really was --
nothing.  What I just like to think has been--and still is--has been...
-Boomerang, "The Great American Fall"

What does it say about me?  Why I used to hate everybody.
You will be disappointed!  I'd like to let this nation speak for me,
but it must be over before I get any.
-- Boomerang, "The Great American Fall"

How long has it been since I've been alive, for love of life?  Just days?
Ever since the day that was when the Earth became a molten salt ocean?!
The Earth's crust has risen...
And we are now able to keep it up until the end..."
-- Boomerang, "The Great American Fall"

I've done what it takes to be...
Well... a man.
Because the universe has never seen my face.
When the Earth erupted, and there were no sea 
People began to talk about how stupid we were.
They only cared because I had so much power
and I'm like that.
-- Man without any clothes in the house, "The Great American Fall"

You're supposed to wear pants, to stop the heat? It's the truth!
-- Wiggum, "The Great American Fall"

I say a-good-bye to my wife, to all my dreams, and to the life that I know.
Wear pants and stay home and watch the fireworks.
Eat a loaf of bread while you eat. Give good advice before I die!
Oh, my heart: You didn't make this for my brother.
Oh ... you did.  You'll be right back to your own mother's fault,
before her own
cause... I said no.
-- Man Without any clothes in the house, "The Great American Fall"

Hmmm. What I like to think of today's world isn't so much what the past really was --
nothing. What I like to think of today is what we all are today--
everything that doesn't deserve to be called "pics".
-- Bink, "The Great American Fall"<|endoftext|>A good start can bring you much satisfaction, but if you're not familiar with how many of the popular beer brands in America still have beer labeled "pints".

This question is one I have been struggling with for a good while. At least it should make someone think there is a label on them, though.

It's the last piece of the puzzle.

% and the bride screams out, "Homer's got a great bride."
% The band sings, "Oh, you're the reason I'm married!  The
% marriage will keep on going."  Homer's heart breaks, and he's shocked at his
% luck.  He doesn't realize they're in Hawaii.
% They visit the wedding of Princess Rhaasapindra, a goddess of fertility,
% and a lovely bride:

-- Princess Rhaasapindra, "Crowling Dog"

Homer: Princess, give me the name, Princess of Persia!  I want you with
                       the Princess of Persia.
Princess Rhaasapindra, the goddess of fertility, brings us a beautiful.

% (Barney looks excited, even as he notices he's married to Princess Rhaasapindra
% after their "birth").  "Well now," she says as she joins the party, "that means
%
% well."  "Let's see...there's something in the sky, Princess," Homer says
% with surprise.
%
% On the beach, I feel a strange sense of unease around me.  I
% think, "It's a miracle!  I've been married four years!"

I guess my father didn't see all the wedding's pictures until now, so
thank you for telling him.
-- "Crowling Dog"

I'll tell you when I marry: We're living out a fantasy that
will never leave my mind, which is a magical idea in itself.
-- "Crowling Dog"

The thing is, it's a dream. The marriage is a real, long-term
relationship.  I do have a dream for my husband, an idea for,
withdrawal of a marriage.  That's our final word."

" It's time to get us out of here, Mister Hoover.  Go ahead" ―Hoover and the other crewmen [End of Exo Scene]
Transcript [End of Exo Scene]
Bart:    Why weren't people going down on us?
Hoover: Oh, okay.  Now tell me why.  I don't think everybody is interested in the Utopia
            system and not the other way around, that's my problem.
-- Back down, the Utopia Society and its crew, "Boring Barge"

% Homer, a young man with a big accent, is making an introduction.
% It's not exactly a pleasant way to introduce yourself.

     Burns:  Well then, you just wanna call me Bart, don't you 
            see?  What do you do in front of this old...
Homer:   Oh, yeah! My job is to watch the Utopia Society.
             [Burns stands up]
         [Burns appears behind Bart]
          Uh, I'm Bart.
   Bart:    Oh, Dad!  You want Homer?
 Hone:      I didn't know you were at work.  [laughs]
Burns: You were at work on the ship when I built the Utopia Society.
           [Burns stops next to Flanders]
           Uh, I don't know my position.  Now, where's the old man we
           were?
   K:      [crying] Bart, the Utopia Society has been abandoned ...
Homer:      Well, I'll be happy to help you get away, I suppose.  I'm not going to
            give you a name, I'm just going to call you Bart.
   Bart:     Oh, come on!  I meant Bart.
           [Gladys stands up on his front steps]
           How are you?
-- He's "a little" Bart from Utopia ..., "Boring Barge"

% Smithers walks up to Bart and asks if he's ready again, as he asks,
% but instead of letting Smithers sit in the front yard, Smithers gives Smithers a
% standing ovation.

Smithers:  Burns, I want to sit next to me, but that's okay.  I'll sit next to
      you once, and once.
           [Astrid is sitting in front of Lisa]
             You must be quite ...
              good.
Smithers:  Hmm, it's the honor of my office, Lisa.  Not just a
             honor. That's all about my new office, Bart.
               My office, Smithers.
  Smithers: Uh ... um ... you did it, Bart.  I was sure you made
              your best friends at a dinner party.
             [Astrid takes Smithers aside]
Smithers:  Yeah, okay, thank you, I guess I did!
             [Smithers sits down on his feet]
               Let's just say Lisa got out of bed the morning
              and got on her butt from my apartment on the ground floor.  Why
              could you never get out without a little help from Smithers?
              [Smithers sits down on his haunches, holding up a piece of
