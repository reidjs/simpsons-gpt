[to Lisa]    Hi, I'm Lisa Simpson. I'm an instructor at Your Springfield-
      Marge Simpson Academy.
Karen:   Homer, how's my morning?
Homer: Very little.                  Well!    I do not have, you know, a big
                   breakfast.   What are you doing?         Me and you?
[looks to Lisa]     I am running.  What could you say?       We're supposed to          run again?
Homer: That's not what I said.    Maybe just a little bit more.
Lisa:           You're a student of history at the academy, aren't you?       Yes you are.
Homer: Sure.   I suppose there are some things that make me do 
            not only homework but instruction. 
-- A student of history at the academy?      ??
   Lisa:                                        What did you learn, Homer?
Homer: I learned the history of the United States of America.   In
                my class, we're taught it and we'll 
              teach you about it.  That's             I think I teach 
                  those days.                 That was a lot of lessons 
                          with us.

-- Homer's history?           Bart's history?   Homer, I don't think you, Bart, know

                                         smart teacher, I am just glad
      Lisa is such a hard-working teacher, the students -- like
     them -- are too happy.   A little bit of work is needed though. 
-- The one thing Lisa hates that nobody likes,
   Simpson,
     Lisa:       Okay, we're right.  It's still a small class, but we're 
        knowing more about that world and our own future.
Homer:        [sighs]       You know, for me, school is everything.  My 
       students are the brightest, brightest students I've ever heard.
Lisa:         You know what they say about being smart?  Smart students are 
                              stupid teachers!
-- And it's just the beginning, Bart,

    Bart was at a business lunch meeting and thought, 
                   Lisa was being sarcastic.  Maybe she 
                          is being funny?

Marge:  You've never met Lisa before, yet you say you don't mind.
         [Kenny walks by]
Jenny:  You've only known it since we were little. It's hard to believe
         when you remember all your good feelings.
          No one knew. Lisa was a freak of nature, maybe!
          Oh, it just seemed crazy for her. I wonder if she
         can come back?
          [looks to Bart] Oh, she's a wild animal. She did
          make a mistake. She fell down a chimney.  Bart
          and I had to stop her.
Bart:  Oh-no.  I did that.
Lisa:  Oh.  Oh, oh. I thought we ate him.
Bart:  Oh, well I guess.
          [hides] I got no love.
Lisa:  Oh, well, well.
Bart:  Oh, I got no love.

Lisa:  Oh.  Oh.
Bart:  Oh.  Ooh, no love. (Hanging by a
          fence)

Homer:   Yumm.
Lisa:  Oh, it's just.  The family, they're just getting
           their asses back.
Homer:    Uh-huh, you'll find out soon enough.
Bart:   Oh well, we'll see you soon, Homer.
Homer:   Yup.  We'll see you soon, Homer.
 Lisa:    Yeah, we'll see you soon.
Homer:   What are you talking about?  Are you in love or are you in

    crazy; a couple of hundred miles away they can eat you!  I, a
                  kid of a hunch.  I didn't think of it.

                         We're going to eat some dogs, Homer. 
Homer:     Yum.  Uh, yes, I didn't think of it -- there's two dog
                                             boys.
Yay!  We'll eat a few kids now, just for fun!
                                  Yummy.  Okay.
Homer:     So, here we go again.
Yuh!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!

In order to put up with the high and the bad, we'll be getting ready for them all in the "Warm" section below.
Warm Episode:
"The Great American Fall"
In that time, one of the greatest events of our modern era has happened:
Warm-Won, Warming-Won. Ever since we invented the automobile, it's been with us for more than 300 Years,
with

The first electric car was built, and
The last electric car was built...
Boomerang ...
BOO! I mean, the two best cars in the history of mankind.
But, of course. ... a lot of things have changed since then.
-Boomerang, "The Great American Fall"

A great deal has changed because there is now
some sort of change in the world.
This has turned out to be the great American Fall....
Fate? ... to tell you the truth, I still think the present is... 
Hmmm. What I like to think of today's world isn't so much what the past really was --
nothing.  What I just like to think has been--and still is--has been...
-Boomerang, "The Great American Fall"

What does it say about me?  Why I used to hate everybody.
You will be disappointed!  I'd like to let this nation speak for me,
but it must be over before I get any.
-- Boomerang, "The Great American Fall"

How long has it been since I've been alive, for love of life?  Just days?
Ever since the day that was when the Earth became a molten salt ocean?!
The Earth's crust has risen...
And we are now able to keep it up until the end..."
-- Boomerang, "The Great American Fall"

I've done what it takes to be...
Well... a man.
Because the universe has never seen my face.
When the Earth erupted, and there were no sea 
People began to talk about how stupid we were.
They only cared because I had so much power
and I'm like that.
-- Man without any clothes in the house, "The Great American Fall"

You're supposed to wear pants, to stop the heat? It's the truth!
-- Wiggum, "The Great American Fall"

I say a-good-bye to my wife, to all my dreams, and to the life that I know.
Wear pants and stay home and watch the fireworks.
Eat a loaf of bread while you eat. Give good advice before I die!
Oh, my heart: You didn't make this for my brother.
Oh ... you did.  You'll be right back to your own mother's fault,
before her own
cause... I said no.
-- Man Without any clothes in the house, "The Great American Fall"

Hmmm. What I like to think of today's world isn't so much what the past really was --
nothing. What I like to think of today is what we all are today--
everything that doesn't deserve to be called "pics".
-- Bink, "The Great American Fall"<|endoftext|>A good start can bring you much satisfaction, but if you're not familiar with how many of the popular beer brands in America still have beer labeled "pints".

This question is one I have been struggling with for a good while. At least it should make someone think there is a label on them, though.

It's the last piece of the puzzle.

% and the bride screams out, "Homer's got a great bride."
% The band sings, "Oh, you're the reason I'm married!  The
% marriage will keep on going."  Homer's heart breaks, and he's shocked at his
% luck.  He doesn't realize they're in Hawaii.
% They visit the wedding of Princess Rhaasapindra, a goddess of fertility,
% and a lovely bride:

Homer: Princess, give me the name, Princess of Persia!  I want you with
                       the Princess of Persia.
Princess Rhaasapindra, the goddess of fertility, brings us a beautiful.

% after their "birth").  "Well now," she says as she joins the party, "that means
%
% well."  "Let's see...there's something in the sky, Princess," Homer says
% with surprise.
%
% On the beach, I feel a strange sense of unease around me.  I
% think, "It's a miracle!  I've been married four years!"

I guess my father didn't see all the wedding's pictures until now, so
thank you for telling him.
-- "Crowling Dog"

I'll tell you when I marry: We're living out a fantasy that
will never leave my mind, which is a magical idea in itself.
-- "Crowling Dog"

The thing is, it's a dream. The marriage is a real, long-term
relationship.  I do have a dream for my husband, an idea for,
withdrawal of a marriage.  That's our final word."

Bart:    Why weren't people going down on us?
Hoover: Oh, okay.  Now tell me why.  I don't think everybody is interested in the Utopia

          Uh, I'm Bart.
   Bart:    Oh, Dad!  You want Homer?
 Hone:      I didn't know you were at work.  [laughs]
Burns: You were at work on the ship when I built the Utopia Society.
           [Burns stops next to Flanders]
           Uh, I don't know my position.  Now, where's the old man we

   K:      [crying] Bart, the Utopia Society has been abandoned ...
Homer:      Well, I'll be happy to help you get away, I suppose.  I'm not going to
            give you a name, I'm just going to call you Bart.
   Bart:     Oh, come on!  I meant Bart.

Smithers:  Burns, I want to sit next to me, but that's okay.  I'll sit next to

             You must be quite ...

Smithers:  Hmm, it's the honor of my office, Lisa.  Not just a
             honor. That's all about my new office, Bart.
               My office, Smithers.
  Smithers: Uh ... um ... you did it, Bart.  I was sure you made
              your best friends at a dinner party.
             [Astrid takes Smithers aside]
Smithers:  Yeah, okay, thank you, I guess I did!

Denny: Dad.

 Lisa: [quietly] That's right.  When he first 
        said... well... he made it a point not to

             to see the family, at least if-- and maybe 
              Lenny ever gets out of Springfield.  Marge says she can 
               see that.  Marge says she can see her brother, which  
              Homer gets a little jealous about.  Lisa says she'll 
              see if she can see her sister, at least if Homer thinks 
                she may.  She tells her brother she'll keep 
                all Marge keeps telling her about Lisa.  Lisa 
                 says that she thinks you're doing well, and 
                 she does.  But Lisa's so kind-- even if

Homer: [on a nice note] It's your fault for 
                   all your great time.  But now I'm proud to say my son is

Boeing has found that its new-look plane could make "very dangerous" crashes, "if it does something to the runway" in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal, a research effort that shows that such crashes could leave the plane in "very dangerous condition."

The aviation world has been impressed by the aircraft's handling and security, yet the newspaper's findings make no sense and show that not enough attention needs to be paid to aviation safety.

The story's executive editor, Charles Burns, goes on to explain that this is his hope -- an aim that "not all pilots are born strong on their feet: the young, hard-working people of Kedah, Iran."

Burns further points out that a person living outside the country's shores could be on fire ... possibly on some sort of human incinerator.

Burns then explains how Kedah has been a haven for such crashes, but is now "in the hands of the [F-16 fighter jets], and may soon be as dangerous as our own own."

He continues that he is "proud of Kedah's beautiful coast, its many beautiful waterfalls and beautiful nature features, and its pristine wildlife."

But he does state that the country's coastline is "doomed, and must be taken out in a few weeks' time."

Burns concludes his piece by stating that he is not a "pessimist of the doomed aircraft."

When they fly the airfields, "we have learned the greatest danger lies between ... we and the ground." [Marge uses her gun]
They have learned the greatest danger lies
with the plane.

[on a plane] Let me get this straight: this plane has left one plane destroyed at sea,
this plane has a terrible accident. This plane must return to Kedah. We can have that --
let them return --

They are also shown taking pictures of the plane.

======================================== SAMPLE 39 ========================================
LONDON, N.H. (NEWS 1030) - A man shot and taken down by British helicopter flying at night was a "very young child", the British helicopter said on Saturday, warning of a long-term problem.

A man in his 20s was in the air with a gunshot and shot at close range.

Two members of the family are now at home.

"The man has been taken to an underground bunker for treatment," the helicopter said, "which I've arranged for him in his underwear so he can be sedated for a while."

The British military's response is still on an open mind, says the helicopter.

"If the military's on guard, this is what it looks like when you see a military base," says the helicopter's caption on Twitter.

What's wrong?" asks the helicopter, pointing at a pile of junk mail.

A family of three, "We miss all the things you love about the country," a report by the British government's Office of the President says.

Hmmm. You mean the junk mail that your husband sends you for all those years... It's in your mailbox.
A little boy who's already had the urge to be killed would have the opposite attitude!
That's not what's happened here now, Lisa. "Look, you must have written him.
Hmph. He went down.

So why is a helicopter not flying the night of a flight report?
Because it is the "Fiscal Guidance Center".
It doesn't have a helicopter. It's also built for flying.
It's a very good thing everyone in America loves the F-35A, "The Super Fighter in the Night".

So, our own Tom McBain, as this official puts it...
 "It's time for some reassurance for all the family! We're going to keep quiet for the better part of a summer. Please relax.
You're a tough, tough man." A helicopter, "it's been a very pretty summer, and we're going to be in awe at the results."

And so you hear, "The British helicopter is not allowed aboard any US carrier". I hear it. And you feel the same.
The British are not allowed on carriers. Well, they can't get them any more and they're still allowed on a plane, as you know.
If there's any air force interested in the matter, the US Air Force wants this to be an exercise in honor, rather than a sign of force."

"And we're not just talking about a guy with his head taped up against the counter.
And we're talking about a man who says he fell from the top, after a helicopter crash!"

This recipe shows you how to prepare honey for stoniest breads!
Baked (I used honey)
Mincemeat:   Yay!
Honey:  [scoffs]   Mmmm!
[picks up straws that are going up with his feet]   
Nuts and Bolts:   Yay!
Frying:   Ohh-o-oo-oh! Marge! She's a genius.
Honey:   Now this one is a little different, not from the way I first
             first learned about it and a lot of people thought of
            it when they were living in New Jersey.  And then
            I learned to get rid of my own sugar in that state right
            here on Earth.
Marge:  Uh, this is my original recipe on how to shape a sweet loaf with
     buttermilk sauce as a topping. It's a lot healthier than
           the first two years you've tried it, honey is no-go-nowhere.
Honey:   Okay, I'd like to think so, but I'm not very good at baking.
Marge:   Oh no, here goes honey.  My sweetheart and I want to know, how do you
Marge:   You better not mess it up and bake it yourself with honey or you
         might lose all the way to sugar because you're overstimulated.
Honey:   [smiles, looks up to reveal sugar] Marge, honey, I just
           wanted to see if I could get you to go one size too soon.
Marge:  You can't just go big.  [chuckles]  I know you don't want to, but this is
          very important: there's no sugar in honey.
-- Is there any evidence that honey can give your body those good

           feelings? "Love, Honey, Is This a Choice"?
           [takes Marge up a rabbit egg nest, which holds sugar] 
            Marge, I want you to know that you're right.  I want you to
            not mess up, honey.  That's my sweetie.  I want you to know it doesn't
            matter to you!  It's not!
Honey:   [puck-puck] I hope this helps!  Here are the five tips I have
            taught you about honey:
You don't just want to get sugar drunk; you want to find a way to get some extra
            sweet from it.
You need to be sweet enough to be sweet enough to feel great, if you
want.
When you get on the food chain, taste-good honey tastes like
good sugar.
You find the sweetener "good" in the plantain that's grown on the
food chain. Your teeth aren't made of sugar; they're made of bad sugar.
You want it to be great. When you get there, the best honey in the
state is gone!
You can tell that if you put in more time to study bee, the honey
making habits have really worked. It's just that bee's a beautiful
woman.
Marry it when you grow: your bee's got a sweet tooth.
-- Marge, "Love, Honey, Is This a Choice"?

% Marge tells Homer about her honey habit.

So when you honey-eaten fruit before you're honey-, what did you think
you needed?  Oh, thank you!

% Homer is about to leave, while Marge is asleep.

Marge:    Well, there's some delicious honey in here, and I want to know if

What a wonderful thing to share a moment which I love! Thank you again, Dad!
And just in time for the holidays my dear Mother, will be here with us...  
     oh...
You know, I am blessed with the gift of my very
 future.
Well I do wish to thank people on the inside who have
made it that far by giving me my first kiss on the
shoulder in my life.
A few months back I went to a bowling alley.  Two people came
up on deck.
They took a bowling ball off his belt. 
They told him, not to the least, to go away. 
Well, I say, he'd be a hell of a hit with the kids and people.
And so they put in an ice pick into the back of my arm.
This little boy in me needs some sugar and water 
for me.  I'm not even hungry.
Why don't you call this a day of rest...
      in our case I can get my legs back...
Well we never got it on the date...
Well we found out later that the day is called today.
We are lucky not to have to get our heads together again for a
real bowling alley match.
And tonight is my day job?  I feel a little better...
Thanks for taking care of me.  For our new home on 
the beach there will be people gathered at the end of the boat.
And the new night I'll be here for the last time:

You'll have to do more work to make it a little easier.
I'll be out tomorrow morning on our job...

Well we'll call it the day you're out, but I got an              good 
night!
Love...
[in the kitchen] Oh yeah, that was the last we have!
I must warn my husband, he can kill us both this day...
[a crowd of people, including Bart and Bart's mother]
Homer, you'd be shocked at how much we owe each other.
I know, I know... You're taking your life's work out of everybody's hands.
[to himself he laughs]
And to everyone who knew Homer you are always the boss.
[he chuckles]
And I know you'll say it again... "Oh yes, I'm at my happiest place".
[they laugh]
Well, look at that!
My brain, it's a little too old... it makes me laugh too ...
And every time, there are more kids in the world but,
every time, I make them cry, too... I won't stop.
Now, as someone with a big heart like Homer and a small brain,

this is very much needed right now.
      The kids need more control now... I need a little time
of my own...
[they all laugh as the world begins to fall silent]
Oh, man, Homer and Bart, I'm making you a real deal!
Thank you too much, the world will fall quiet all night long.
But now, I'm going to go off on a tangent.
What the hell happened to the ocean, huh?
And I need a little time to relax.
Maybe my body can handle water better...
I don't want to be in the middle of a lake.

Oh no, I'm so depressed I can't do it.

parents.
[it is obvious that his mind could be wiped out]
Oh my God... Oh my God, everything just fell out of my sails.

Uh, it was a good night's play...

Oh man, I can't tolerate it!
Oh, no!

In this special film, a family tries to explain why they have not experienced the same success as their parents did.
-- The only thing more important, that doesn't have to be a family of six, "The Man Who Wasn't There"

% Family members explain that the family's luck runs out the door and the family has to change jobs.

One man, the daughter of one doctor. She lost his job because she couldn't make it as a
 hernia surgeon...
-- "The Man Who Wasn't There"

Fifty bucks. Uh, don't let the dollar make you feel a little guilty, huh?
-- Family, "The Man Who Wasn't There"

% The family comes to the hospital, the daughter of the new surgeon in charge.

The family is in hysterics.
The doctor is putting her on ice to keep her out.
Her name is        her last name, you got to be      your own doctor...
--  "The Man Who Wasn't There"

% They see a blue sign saying that, if they quit surgery, he can get his new gig
% in a movie theater.

[camera pans to the left of the door to one of the movies]
-- Homer, "The Man Who Wasn't There"

% But, at the theater there is only the head of the family, Lisa.
% Lisa tries to play a little guitar on stage to scare off the parents.

Bertie wants to use a piece of equipment that he wants to build.
Lisa gives him one piece of equipment; a drum...
-- Bart plays the drums on stage at the theater, "The Man Who Wasn't There"

% Lisa tries to play the piano on the couch, but the father doesn't listen.
% Lisa tries with another piece of equipment, but he fails miserably.
% Lisa thinks she made something great out of it, but the dad never listens.
%
% Backstage, Bart plays the piano on the sofa with the son in it.

Bart, Dad, we all love this theater of the devil.
-- A little song by Paul Stapleton, "The Man Who Wasn't There"

% At the piano, Bart doesn't listen too much because the band isn't playing.

  Bart , this one sucks, this one sucks, this one sucks!
-- Lisa, ``The Man Who Wasn't There'' 

% Laughter from the audience of the theater.

% Bart tries to play this guitar in his old theater, but it's not playing,
% he sees it through and says it's a new-age novelty piece!  But he gets bored to his
% own dismay
%      [in a ballad that says it's a old-age novelty piece]
There are no new-age novelty pieces. There are no old-age novelty music.
I don't believe the old guy wrote 'E-Yo'.
-- Homer and Lisa struggle to stop watching ``The Man Who Wasn't There''

% At the theater the family is about to play our children's Christmas carols.

-- Homer, ``The Man Who Wasn't There''
Marge: I think I might be a little bit of a child again.
       [takes Homer's guitar out]
Aah.  Oh...I don't know.  [singing into her purse]
-- Homer, ``The Man Who Wasn't There''

Marge: I need a bass.
           This is a small electric guitar, I love the band
           
I love their music.
-- Homer in Springfield, ``The Man Who Wasn't There''

The new guitar seems to change Bart's heart to life-force, and Lisa's feelings on
the piano get a little bit more hurtful...
-- Bart struggles to get out of his old theater, ``The Man Who Wasn't There''

% Homer tries to play sax in the old-age novelty piece; it doesn't give him any
% success.

Aah.  Oh, this one sounds like a new novelty piece.
-- Homer, ``The Man Who Wasn't There''

% And so Lisa tries to do the same, but Bart is in the wrong place at the right time
% to perform a great old-age novelty piece.

Man: Homer...I don't know, man...I wonder if it can work?
              Man, why don't you play `Stingley''?

% But with no one knowing, Homer and Lisa are sent down to the prison.
% They stay on the boat for about ten days.
% Then, the wind catches Lisa and Homer hanging by one ear.

          Lisa: You didn't say anything about the wind blowing your hair out of
         your ears?
Homer: No, I'm sorry.  I don't have
         anything bad to say to you.  Just, uh, I'm
        trying to be helpful.
Lisa: Well, anyway, the wind blows my hair
        out of my ears out the window, and it blows it back
         back back in to your ears.  And I'm talking of
         back, back out back.
Homer: [smiling] You can't look back on that.  [laughs]
         [in a low voice] Oh, how my life was so painful!
-- For those who don't know, in 1894 Homer, "A Little Light on Homer's Hair"

% The sound of the wind knocking Lisa off the boat is heard
% from within.


Lisa: [unamused] So, what do people like you anyway?
Homer: Oh, for sure they like me.
 Lisa: I'd say they don't like you any more, but you're my
       partner, Homer!
Homer: I've never heard of this old woman's name before.
Lisa: Well, I'd say she's some sort of royalty, Homer.
         [laughs]
 Homer: Lisa, you really know what happened to you so suddenly?
        [unwelcomed]
Lisa: Hey, I know that sounds terrible to say, but I think my
        wife is pretty good at it.
Homer: Good.

           [unanimously laugh].
-- The most romantic comedy ever, "A Little Light on Homer's Hair"

% Lisa reads the paper: Lisa, Lisa...
-- Homer's first marriage, "A Little Light on Homer's Hair"

Homer: I suppose you're wrong about all that.  So is my wife really an 
         famous famous?
Lisa: I'd never heard of Lisa Simpson.
 Lisa: Well, for sure she's famous, anyway.
Homer: Well if I don't prove she isn't just a beautiful 
         blonde then her husband and I won't ever see eye-
            any eyes.
-- Bart's latest marriage, "A Little Light on Homer's Hair"

% Homer thinks he finds something to say to Lisa.

Homer: Homer, if you really think that's important you're missing
          the key point.
 Bart: Okay.  And then why does this make me look like crap?  You said it a
          *happier* time by putting up with me.  It is 
          me, not you.
Homer: So let's be friendly.
 Bart: I can understand that.
Homer: Well, if you're so upset you let her know.
-- Bart vs. Bart, a family-friendly sitcom-like comedy, "A Little Light on Homer's Hair"

% A couple of months before "A Lighter Show", Bart comes along.  While at

 Bart: Bart, I wanted to check in on you.

 Lisa: [gasps] We're never going to see anything like this again!

% Lisa gets angry with Homer with her tongue.  He turns his back onto.
======================================== SAMPLE 52 ========================================
"Oh, ahem," says one fan, "you are so hard on me."

       Homer has started to look like "a hippie," but "you don't like me" doesn't stop this guy for a second.
But he's only getting more convincing this time.
And Homer tells Bart how much he hated him.
Then the Simpsons meet "that guy whose only job is to entertain" Homer's friends.
Homer goes to a local bar where two famous people hang out.  "Homer is the first man to ever enjoy beer and beer mugs, but he got himself into trouble.
And he's been caught drunk, and will now have to pay a fine of ten bucks for being a loser, but he won't have to deal with that."  One guy's the boss for paying him ten bucks.
And one guy's the boss for having the nerve to show his phony, fake-love for  the Simpsons!
But Bart has to do something about some bullies...
And the "tough to prove",  Simpson's the first,  "we're in America again"
Lisa's the "bad boy"
"It's the people, it's the government, and it's the big-government-ism
that's been behind all this."

         Bart and Lisa head to an amusement park built of cartoon characters.  "The Simpsons get you a drink, they get you everything!"  Bart offers
         their drink. 
          [two girls gasp but then a loud laugh pops up] And that's why    I like Lisa
          so much!  She's not a bad girl.  It's been a long time since I took a

By Gary A. Knaak

We have this new report from CRI (and other big companies: the National CRI Institute)

Some people believe that by cutting prices, they will have lowered the cost of their
food. [The whole world agrees.] It's a wonderful thing to see people think big and

so many people like to believe in it. But when you throw it away, no one reads it
and doesn't remember your name, nothing happens,
and no one listens to you.
Nervous about that, I guess I'm free for now?
-- Gary A. Knaak, ``Free Market for All''

Hmmmm. We've got to find ways to help pay our fair share of the price
of all our food supplies.  We've cut prices for a new book
And we have one big problem: you really don't have to buy something to be in
this country?  For this reason, most people look at
this report and laugh while the poor are treated like the bad guys. 
-- ``Free Market for All''

Let's see if you _do_ have to cut your prices, Mr. White.
This report is now available as a free-to-view print to the entire
crowd.
-- Mr. Roosevelt, ``Free Market for All''

     Lisa: "The price of everything you buy in America is at an historic
     high..."
  [cut back down to three quarters below the present market prices...]
 Mr. Obama..   ``I have just had a great success...  My sales have been
immeasurable."
I... I don't care to see this report [cut back down to three
 quarters below the current market price...]
I believe that, since prices of everything fall ... that all things
go to           in a basket...
And that should be the case with all things.  Just see the news.
Thank you!-- President John F. Kennedy,
      ``Free Market for All''

     President Kennedy,
      Look, I'm a government official-and the money we pay for that
       government work [I can't see why] would cost more,
       than this sum of dollars?  Why was this price,
       so high, so highly charged  and so quickly
       wasted... because I had to pay so much for it [I'm]
impossible,
        why no one reads that report,  why doesn't anyone read the
       ... report ... and doesn't remember your name?  Don't take my word, I know
       all you know.  I know if I do that report I'll make

The first woman to ever enter the military was a high-profile woman: Selma Brockman. Brockman, a famous dancer in Atlanta, went on to have a massive career success.
Brockman would be the first to be awarded the title "Elastic First Lady" by President Lyndon Johnson.
They came to the White House, and the President was a little worried:
The next day, Bart and Abe had to go to a meeting. In what looks like a little joke, it turns out that Bart doesn't even have a girlfriend but that Abe is the most beautiful dancer in the world!
Bart looks down and sees Abe's boyfriend
Bart and Abe watch on, then a beautiful woman walks over, making off for her.
She's a model, too.
The next morning they have to do some laundry.
Bart wears some clothes, but no clothes and a skirt.
He's still wearing a T-shirt.
They're the "Elastic First Ladies."
They come in line at the desk, and Bart pulls a t-shirt out of the pocket and slips it
into some pants. But Bart comes through in a flash.
He's dressed down to full, dressed in his usual goth hair, and wearing a puffy suit.
They look shocked and confused.
Bart tries to get the President to go away for a while, but
he thinks he's been doing so long, but can't.  Then suddenly
howls his head, the President comes through and stops him.
Everyone knows Homer and Bart, but all Lisa
believes is Bart.  Bart and Homer seem a little scared:
Lisa just looks down, then Bart's shoes, and then Bart's sweater, his
own shoes, now his shoes.
Everyone sees Bart, and then Bart pulls out a bunch of
shirts and a shirt. Bart says it wasn't him, but a lady in the room.
This is supposed to be the moment everyone can all talk: The first lady!
Lisa is impressed by the new look of her outfit, and everyone gets into
her car: the one with the blue-dressed lady.
When all the ladies leave, Homer and Bart look at each other:
Homer's very happy: he knows Homer has a girlfriend but...
[pissing the top-couplers from his coat]
Homer says he's married and wants her, then runs it over.
The lady runs out of the house: the door swings out.
All the ladies sit on the grass. Homer runs, trying to get around it.
Somebody runs in.
Everyone walks by. Bart tries to knock Bart out with his shoes...
Then someone puts Bart on the ground and hits Bart in his stomach.

        musical crap?  What's the matter, man?
 Bart:     I can't explain that you can't even hear it, because
        I want you home now.  If anything happens to my brain, I'm
        going to have to do something about it.  [hands off a piece of tissue to a

                   he's no longer having a big brain in front of him,

Karloff told The New York Times of a "vigilance system" that "came to work as a powerful "spholotl".

But the findings have had little or no other applications.

They say that in humans, we've just as much reason for worry and fear as we do for attention and health.
Karloff, however, isn't so confident or confident.

"I think it's safe to say that we've just given up our obsession for the latest science and invented the unsophisticated "Smoker".

 Jimmy: I used to stay in one a year. All the time I used to be
Jimmy: I'm telling you... [Jimmy pushes into Jimmy's car].
Jimmy: My life has been wasted... I'll never get over.

Jimmy's car begins to run. Jimmy is still in Jimmy's car, who runs through a crowd.
Lenny runs over the police car, as he tries to run. They chase away.

Jimmy: Now just a minute!  I think our next stop is under the

Bike Maintenance Department.
 Jimmy: How'd you get off the bike, Lenny?
-- Heh.  The two cars come to a stop,  "Beware the Man"

Marge drives off with one, so Homer crashes into one. He stops in front
of the train station before it comes to a stop. The man, a middle-aged man
like Bart, grabs him by the waistcoat. He then pulls out and starts
