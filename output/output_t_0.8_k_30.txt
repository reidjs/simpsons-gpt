Well, I guess you're wrong about the bad guys. I was thinking, "I don't
know what to do with you! I don't even know how to get your name on a

paper." And I got that, too.


      [to Lisa and Ned]
Yeah, I don't quite know what to do with you. I mean, you
know, even when we were in the big brotherhood, we never got any

real answers.

      and I want to be in some kind of a good mental state.

Oh, no.  I'm not saying you're not a good person, but that
you're not going to win a fight.
