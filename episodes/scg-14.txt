[=========================[Season Fourteen Summary]=========================]

Story cut episodes: DABF22, EABF01, EABF06, EABF09, EABF10, EABF11, EABF12,
                    EABF13, EABF15, EABF17.
Compressed episodes: All episodes were compressed.
Expanded episode: EABF06.
Changed content: DABF21, EABF08, EABF13, EABF14, EABF15.

Total time cut: 2:05 (2 min 5 sec)
Story time cut: 1:36 (1 min 36 sec)
Total time gained: 11:26 (11 min 26 sec)

Notes: As with season 13, the season 14 episodes in which the opening was
       edited for syndication have the "voiceless intro." These are EABF14,
       EABF15, and EABF16 (and if this trend persists, I might move this list
       to the header). In these openings, the only sound until the couch gag
       is music: no "The Simp-sons," no sound effects like car noises or
       Maggie being scanned, no sounds from Homer in the driveway.

       Also like season 13, there are no TV ratings in the corner of the
       screen for any episodes (even EABF12, which got a TV-14 on its network
       runs).

       ! The original Fox broadcast went to text credits and a smaller,
       ! full-ratio box for the behind-the-scenes footage (except maybe for
       ! satellite/international broadcasts?); in syndication, for this
       ! section, the left half of the screen is squeezed yellow-on-black
       ! MG-style credits, and the right half is a cropped version of the
       ! footage (a 2:3 ratio instead of 4:3), so more was actually shown on
       ! Fox. This is not what happened with CABF12; go figure.

       ! was told by a "gregh111" that the original line referred to
       ! Scarsdale (New York). There was a local Simpsons radio promo that
       ! played that version of Homer's line to get the town excited about
       ! it, in fact. (That town name matches Homer's mouth movement a lot
       ! better than either of the other two.) Presumably, it was changed
       ! before the premiere to avoid legal problems that might arise. It
       ! still doesn't explain why two alternate versions exist, though. More
       ! information would be appreciated, and when season 14 comes out on
       ! DVD, I'll have a full writeup in the DVD guide.

       ! Voiceless intro

       + Blackboard: I will not Xerox my butt
       + Solo: Main Theme

       ! A creative, if odd, way to shorten the opening. Oddly, 7F01 used the
       ! full opening, so they still had to do some splicing; and 50-second
       ! season 2 openings (note the four notes as Maggie pops out of the bag
       ! instead of the more recent two) typically used a different solo, so
       ! it seems like no work was saved (compared to using EABF14's original
       ! blackboard and solo). And, of course, it's "voiceless" like altered
       ! season 13 episodes, but by this I also mean there are no sound
       ! effects at all until the couch gag.

       ! Note also that the Xerox blackboard never made it to syndication
       ! (that is, with 7F01), so EABF14 and EABF15 "make up" for it I guess.

       ! (*I was reminded later by "Senor Spielbergo" that 4F19 also used a

       ! Get ready for some world-class cuts here. This has got to be the

       ! cuts in about four minutes; it's not quite as bad as DABF05 or
       ! CABF13, but still quite annoying. (The cuts' timings are rounded to
