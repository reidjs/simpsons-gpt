> TV Guide Synopsis
==============================================================================
   (Canadian) In the series' 200th episode, Homer dumps a mountain of trouble
   on Springfield when he promises to trash the city's garbage woes, but
   his appointment of Sanitation Commissioner busts the budget and causes
   a huge stink for the townspeople. Steve Martin and U2 members Steve
   Bono, The Edge and Adam Clayton provide guest voices. {hl}

* Shouldn't the slump run from July through November, or did somebody come up
  with Halloween cards?  (Okay, okay, places like Hallmark do sell "Halloween
  party supplies" throughout October...). {ddg}

  [Don adds, "And I do remember one radio talk show host's idea: move the
  commercial part of Christmas to August 1 and call it `X-mas'." --hmw]

= The sales-graph in Costingtons changes between shots. (ie. the line gets
  thicker, the shape of the line changes.)

+ It seems a bit unlikely that the Simpsons would have been able to afford
  all of those Love Day decorations. {nmd}

- The are no faces in the pictures behind Bart when he picks up the boogying
  pumpkin. {je}

= The Breakfast Log label seems to shrink in size to look more like a square
  of paper. {ar}

= The pen Homer writes "B+" with disappears after he uses it.

= The trash Homer spills on the road vanishes.

- Both graded papers are missing when Homer gets back from his fight. {th}
  [I presume Marge took the fake "B+" down, and took the genuine down
  alongside it, accidentally. --hmw]

= Maggie's hair bow is missing in one scene. {ad}

+ I don't believe there's a window in the dining room. {ad}

= When Flanders comes to the front door, a window suddenly appears over the
  front door; later, it disappears. {ddg}

+ Bart's room has been a corner room in every previous episode; and the window
  over the front door is missing later in the episode. {th}

+ In 7F15 Marge says that Patty doesn’t like to be touched, yet is in line as
  a sex offender (maybe she's keeping Selma company). {af}

= I'll ignore the background repeating itself when Homer's driving promoting
  himself, as it's a standard animation technique, but when the roll of
  buildings resets, the frame jerks (lets just say Homer drove over a bump
  in the road).

= Homer was across the car from the microphone Bart was holding, so his
  voice shouldn't have been heard in the megaphones. {je}

= When the Big-Nosed-Guy speaks, Willie is standing next to a woman, later
  on he his standing to the right of Cletus. {af}

- The view from Patterson's old office suggests a tall office building.  The
  town hall has no more than three stories. {je}

= After Homer's second joke, Chief Wiggum is sitting next to Mrs. Glick,
  unlike before. {af}

= Apu is not sitting next to Carl when Ray walks in. (And it looks like Carl
  and Kirk switched seats.) {af}

= Carl is seated next to Sarah Wiggum after Ray mentions Homer messed with his
  breaks, unlike previously. {af}

= Homer's door keeps changing between 3 lines of text and 4; sometimes Homer's
  name appears on one line and sometimes two. {ddg}

= The words "Sanitation Commissioner" on Homer's door sometimes move around.
  {je}

= Marge was holding a long line of papers, then they became a small, neat
  pile. {je}

* If the whole town where on top of the mine, it would cave in. {ar}

= When we first see the buildings being moved, there are no buildings beyond
  OFF's House & Moe's. When Homer leaps into Moe's, we see plenty of buildings
  behind him, which disappear after the scene switches back to the buildings
  being moved. {af}

* Even if they move all of the buildings in the town, what are they going
  to do about streets, parks, and other town features (and how much do you
  want to bet that they'll be back to normal next week)? {nmd}

* How are they going to move the SNPP 5 miles down the road on a lift like all
  the other houses? {ar}

c When someone from U2 (I don't know their names) says "Oh, here we go again"
  at the spoon, the captions say "Wow, that is a beauty". {je}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Great expectations almost inevitably result in great
   disappointment, and such certainly was the case with "Trash of the Titans."
   The writers tried _so_ hard to come up with the Simpsons episode to end all
   Simpsons episodes, that the result was sadly mediocre.  I'm not saying it
   was terrible: it had its pleasures, chief among them the fine vocal work
   from Steve Martin.  The problem with the episode is that it just threw on
   guest voices, musical numbers, and cultural references, and ended up
   sounding loudly pale. (C)

Rich Bunnell:  I'm probably one of the only people on a.t.s. that is
   constantly amused by each episode (I didn't understand why "The Last
   Temptation Of Krust" was so bashed) and therefore, this episode was a
   definite winner for me. Yes, Steve Martin didn't do much, but U2 made up
   for the jokes that he didn't do. The musical number was good (and actually
   funny, for once) and the scene with Mr. Bunny coming out of his grave was
   one of the funniest jokes of the episode. The only downside was when I saw
   the ending. I LIKED the ending, I thought the idea of moving Springfield
   five miles down the road was funny, but when I saw it, I just KNEW that
   everyone was going to complain about it. Whatever, the episode lives up to
   the title of #200, and I'll have to give it an... (A)

Ben Collins:  Executive Producer Mike Scully has a very Fox-like idea of how
   a Simpsons episode should work. "Let's put in big-name special guest
   voices (no matter how useless their roles are), create a musical number
   (no matter how dumb), base it around any plot (no matter how retarded) and
   the Poochie fans in South Park Land will love it. Oh yeah, and it doesn't
   matter who or what writes it; just because we found Ian Maxtone-Graham at
   a 'Write a Simpsons Episode' contest doesn't mean he can ruin THIS kewl
   combination." Mike Scully has no idea what he's talking about. (D)

Chris Courtois:  "Trash of the Titans" was an ultimately unsatisfying mixture
   of good and bad elements we've gotten to know over the past 200 episodes.
   On the plus side, the episode featured some great satire with the creation
   of "Love Day" and the "Can't Someone Else Do It?" political campaign. On
   the minus side, Homer was more of an asshole than he's been all season,
   when we did hear from Lisa she was shrill, and the ending was kind of stupid.
   The musical number was so-so. Steve Martin did a good job as Ray Patterson.
   U2 parodying their 1980s self-righteous image was less successful, mainly
   because U2 has already been parodying themselves since the ZooTv tour, and
   the joke is stale. (Heck, that was a major criticism of last year's Pop
   Mart tour). This poses the same problem the writers had with the variety
   show segment of last season's spin-off showcase: how do you effectively
   parody something that is already a self-parody. Some good stuff, but
   asshole-Homer drags this one down to a... (B-)

Anthony Dean: This episode was a weak effort overall. Much of the episode's
   faults reminded me too much of other recent weak entries, such as
   "Homerpalooza" or even "The Principal and the Pauper" (this episode's
   decidedly unfunny and bizarre ending reminded me of PatP's). The few high
   points were Lisa's reaction to Homer's David and Goliath statement and his
   refusal to pay for a copy of the Springfield Shopper. Still, these didn't
   overcome the rest of this episode's faults. At the end, all I could think
   of was that I had taped over this morning's hilarious "Pinky and the
   Brain" episode for this. (D)

Nathan Mulac DeHoff:  This week's episode was somewhat of a mixed (garbage)
   bag.  Some parts worked, and some, well, didn't.  The episode started out
   well enough, with a clever blackboard/couch gag, and a good satire on
   holiday merchandising.  The events that led Homer to run for sanitation
   commissioner were not done especially well.  Being stubborn is within
   Homer's character, but he seemed to carry it to extremes.  His campaign
   was amusing, and Homer's solution to the garbage problem was a good
   example of Homer being clever and stupid at the same time.  I didn't care
   for the scenes with the garbage erupting into the town, though.  It was
   too unrealistic, and I think that the garbage could have been discovered
   in a different manner.  Moving the town was ridiculous, but creative.
   U2's appearance didn't live up to the hype (What does?), but I enjoyed
   Homer's potato man disguise, and the ending scene on the plane.  Overall,
   it was a decent episode, but a bit too ridiculous, and not handled quite
   so well as it could have been. (B-)

Jordan Eisenberg:  I'm starting to wonder why I bother reviewing these
   anymore.  Mike Scully rightfully held this episode until now, and the
   high-quality animation and extra attention to detail given to it because it
   was the 200th are the only things that can compliment it enough.  I'll soon
   be quoting everything like crazy so watch out... everyone with 14.4kb
   modems thank me for my short review. (A+)

Alex Flandonwittsy:  Homer owned this episode. Surprisingly, he was also one of
   the least enjoyable aspects of it. Our hero acted too "in your face" and
   cruel. Some other problems occurred in this 200th episode, including the whacked
   out plot, the even wackier(and stupider) ending, and the little air time
   the other four Simpson family members got. Good laughs at the U2 concert,
   though. (C-)

Alex Foley:  Great first 2 and a 1/2 acts, ruined by the Season 9 staple of a
   horrible ending. Good song, but Steve Martin talents are wasted and Homer
   the jerk returns. (B-)

Andrew Gill:  Put simply, this is looks like the best show that a FOX exec
   could produce. Unfortunately, this was not done by FOX execs.  The dialogue
   was horrible (Quimby, especially).  Homer was back to idiocy, the lowbrow
   humor reared its ugly head, again, the pacing was off, and the zany plot
   wormed its way in.  Fortunately, the characterization was good (except
   Homer) and the plethora of problems made it too hard to focus on any one.
   Keeping that in mind, the grades are: Technical merits: (D) Artistic
   quality: (B)

Tony Hill:  Once again plastic reality ruins an episode.  The whole city
   moved five miles away?  Everything up to the golf course scene was cute
   and funny. It seemed odd to see Steve Martin playing a straight character.
   But two Homers would be too much.  I give it a... (B-)

Kevin Hinrichs:  I thought the episode was pretty good. Homer's fight with the
   garbage man, his election campaign, and the town being destroyed. Homer
   proved he has gotten even stupider. The gags, such as Mr. Bunny, Cletus's
   appearance,  and U2s appearance were pretty funny. Good conclusion. (A)

Haynes Lee:  For once the big name guest stars actually contributed to the
   boot. But why another non-sequitur ending? (B-)

Jake Lennington:  One of the (in the minority) bad episodes of Season 9.  We
   have an episode that gives us the classic 8th season, jackass, out of
   control Homer trying out for a job he was never meant to have.  Overall a
   bland outing with few laughs. (I like the songs, but the garbage song was
   not funny, IMO)  IMO, the best scene was when U2's guards were beating the
   tar out of Homer on the big TV screens.  I was hoping that would shut him
   up. (D+)

Ondre Lombard:  High-energy forced gags and celebrity cameos outweigh the
   pursuit of good storytelling as The Simpsons reaches its 200th episode.
   This episode is a pointless, predictable, stupid and unfunny illustration
   of just how low-brow and down in the trash The Simpsons has gotten.  If my
   sentiments haven't been expressed the best way that they could be, I must
   say that I agree with everything Michael Neylon had to say about this
   episode 100%. (D-)

Ewan Macdonald : The song finally put some long-gone musical greatness and
   humour back into the show. I haven't heard a song that good since 'Flaming
   Moe's' or 'We put the Spring in Springfield'. The ending was a bit
   disappointing however,   but the number of 'laugh-out-loud' moments for me
   were the highest for a VERY long time.  Even watching it for a second time
   was good, as many of the gags still were funny, and the song was
   excellent. (A-)

Benjamin Robinson:  A nice show, but one that suffers a bit from "Very Special
   Episode" syndrome.  In the rush to pull out all the stops, some of what
   made the show last 200 episodes in the first place was lost.  On the other
   hand, we did get a good showing from U2 (Steve Martin was wasted, though),
   some good satire, and a plenitude of DYN's and references.  A decent show,
   but I'll be glad when the get to episode 201 and can move on.  (B-)

Yours truly {hmw}:  Yawn. Was reasonable until things started getting out of
   hand (ie. Homer becomes the sanitation commisioner). Steve Martin was
   fabulous! U2 were amusing, but unneccesary. Too much music. The ending was
   a pile of garbage (No pun intended. Well.. I suppose it was intended.) (C-)

>> Two hundred and counting

Mark Aaron Richey summarises the other animated shows which fell before the
   Simpsons in the race to the 200 mark. Note: this was posted on the night
   5F09 aired (26th April 1998) so today's figures may very well be -- and
   are -- different, but at the time of this capsule compilation, The Simpsons
   is still way ahead:

   Tonight, "The Simpsons" becomes the first prime-time animated series to
   reach 200 episodes.   How long did the others last?  Here is a list of how
   many episodes each of the 21 animated series (I think that's the right
   number) that aired on one of the six broadcast networks in prime time
   (7:30-11:00 EST before 1972, 8:00-11:00 EST afterwards, Sundays from
   7:00-11:00).

   This list does not include early evening series on the networks  (The
   original "Rocky and His Friends"), shows on cable ("Daria", "Rugrats"),
   one-time specials, primarily live action shows with some animation ("The
   Tracy Ullman Show--sorry, original OFF shorts), shows on PBS, or shows in
   syndication.

   - "The Simpsons"-200 and counting (assuming it airs tonight as scheduled)
     Fox 1989-present (was seen in shorts on "The Tracy Ullman Show" prior to
     becoming a regular series)

   - "The Flintstones"-156 [Mike Smith says 166. --hmw]  ABC 1960-1966 (new
     episodes and spin-off series were seen on Saturday mornings)

   - "The Bullwinkle Show"-107?  NBC 1961-1964 (number of episodes an
     estimate, since I couldn't find an episode guide that listed the exact
     number of episodes.  Follow-up to the non prime time "Rocky and His
     Friends")

   - "The Bugs Bunny Show"-52  ABC 1960-1962 (mostly the theatrical shorts
     with new connecting animation)

   - "King of the Hill"-33 and counting (assuming it airs tonight as
     scheduled) Fox 1997-present

   - "Top Cat"-30  ABC 1961-1962

   - "The Alvin Show"-26  CBS 1961-1962 (new episodes seen on Saturday
     mornings)

   - "Calvin and the Colonel"-26 [Mike Smith says 39. --hmw] ABC 1961-1962

   - "Jonny Quest"-26  ABC 1964-1965 (new episodes seen in syndication)

   - "Batman: The Animated Series"-24?   Fox 1992-1993  (I couldn't find the
     exact run dates, and all prime time episodes appear to be reruns from the
     afternoon series.  How many different episodes actually aired in prime
     time I don't know.  New episodes seen on weekday afternoons and Saturday
     mornings)

   - "The Jetsons"-24  ABC 1962-1963  (new episodes seen in syndication)

   - "The Critic"-23  ABC 1994, Fox 1995

   - "The New Adventures of Huck Finn"-20  NBC 1968-1969

   - "CBS Cartoon Theater"-13?   CBS 1956  (series was mostly theatrical
     Terrytoon shorts, with connecting commentary from an unknown Dick Van
     Dyke. It aired for 13 weeks, but I don't know if the show was ever
     pre-empted or any reruns were shown)

   - "Pinky and the Brain"-13  WB 1995-1996 (new episodes seen on Saturday
     morning)

   - "Where's Huddles?"-10  CBS 1970

   - "This is America, Charlie Brown"-8  CBS 1988-1989  (only first four were
     shown as a series, during the fall.  The remaining four were shown once a
     month the following spring)

   - "Capitol Critters"-7  ABC 1992

   - "Family Dog"-5  CBS 1993 (pilot episode seen in 1987) [Mike Smith says,
     "The `Pilot Episode' is, in fact, an episode of `Amazing Stories'. --hmw]

   - "Fish Police"-3  CBS 1992

   - "Jokebook"-3  NBC 1982 (mostly theatrical shorts connected with new
     animation)


>> The skinny of the 200 episodes

Haynes Lee counts up the episodes that led to this single milestone, compiled
   in a handy-dandy table:

     PC:   #
     7G:  13
     7F:  24
     8F:  24
     9F:  22
     1F:  22
     2F:  25
     3F:  25
     3G:   4
     4F:  24
     5F:  17
     -------
         200

   Does not includes are 48 Ullman shorts, 2 Bart music videos,
   and 7 unaired 5F episodes (3 to air in May, 4 next season).


>> To enter, you must be two hundred or over

Jeff Wildman shows us how The Simpsons stack up against over shows
   exceeding the two hundredth episode mark:

   1. "My Three Sons" had 370 episodes
   2. "Peyton Place" (Prime-time) had 514 episodes
   3. "Bonanza" had 430 episodes
   4. "Rawhide" had 216 episodes
   5. "Perry Mason" had 270 episodes
   6. "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" had 265 episodes
   7. "Wagon Train" had 283 episodes
   8. "The Andy Griffith Show" had 249 episodes
   9. "Father Knows Best" had 203 episodes
   10. "The Real McCoys" had 223 episodes
   11. "The Loretta Young Show" had 255 episodes

   Also, I don't have the final counts, but "The Beverly Hillbillies" and
   "Petticoat Junction" both exceeded 200 episodes.


>> What's with the animation?

At the time of the airing, various people complained that the animation on
   this episode was below standard. Ben Collins explains why this could be:
   The Korean production company Anivision (the clowns behind "The Cartridge
   Family," "Lisa the Skeptic," "The Joy of Sect," and other badly-animated
   Season 9 episodes) may have had something to do with this episode's poor
   animation quality. There are obvious differences among Korean houses.
   Akom's work tends to be clean, slick, and professional. Rough Draft is
   somewhat less refined but well-angled and focused, with the best color
   choices. Anivision specializes in lousy colors, misshapen figures
   (especially the eyes), and generally unfinished-looking, sloppy work.


>> Happy Holiday Day!

Benjamin Robinson shares his knowledge on selling schemes: For years now,
   greeting card companies have had a reputation for starting new holidays
   just to increase card sales.  This reputation is largely deserved, if the
   example of Mother's Day still holds.  Now, Hallmark and friends didn't
   actually invent Mother's Day; that was the work of one man who felt there
   should be a day to honor America's mothers.  (His name escapes me, sorry.)
   He intended for it to be a quiet, reverent day when children would travel
   to be with mom and thank her for not leaving them to the wolves.  The
   greeting card companies started innocuously enough with some cards, but
   things sort of blew up from there, and today we have Mother's Day candy,
   flowers, balloons, and Heaven knows what else.  The originator eventually
   turned on his own holiday, trying to keep people from celebrating it.
   Eventually, he wished he had never thought of the idea.

   Other holidays, like Father's Day, were probably even more the idea of 
   the card makers.  And if there's any reason for Secretary Day and Boss's
   Day, other than keeping card companies in clover, I'd like to hear about
   it.

Ben Collins: Anyone remember "Grandparent's Day"? It was invented around the
   early 80s (?), caught on quickly, then fizzled out within a couple of
   years.


>> Car & Truck Watch

Eagle-eyed Benjamin Robinson does some car-spotting: There's a lavender
   Beetle in the plant parking lot (which you see as Carl and Lenny walk
   home).  Perhaps someone took the one from "Girly Edition (5F15)" and
   restored it.  Or, given the p-code order, perhaps someone from the plant
   junked it in time for Bart to use as a hiding place.

   Springfield's garbage trucks resemble Ford's C-series midrange trucks.  
   Ford made this same truck for what seemed like eternity, so it could 
   come from a pretty wide range of model years.


>> The real Ray Patterson

There is a real guy named Ray Patterson who has been working on animation
   since the 1940s. He's been an animator for too many cartoons to count,
   and produced the Sixties "Spider-Man" cartoon.


>> Local nut at it again

The newspaper headline could possibly be a jab at capsule lovin' folk such
   as ourselves. Internet fans have been complaining recently that all the
   new episodes are not decent family-based episodes, but whacky Homer
   adventures.


>> U2

Andrew Gill gives us some details on the band who lend their voices to this
   episode: U2 is probably the only band that came from the 80's that has
   spanned two decades(1980-1998 and beyond).  U2 largely gained stardom
   status through "The Joshua Tree" and "Achtung Baby", and attained
   superstar status through their Zoo Tour.  Last year, U2 decided to make
   their return via the dance CD "Pop".  Most people either like the old U2
   or hate U2 completely.  I suspect that a few like only the "new" U2.  I
   myself like both.


>> "Take a hike, Kojak!"

Tony Hill explains why Homer called the bald operator "Kojak": Kojak was a
   bald detective played by Telly Savalas on the series of the same name,
   which ran on CBS from 1973 to 1978.  (There was a revival on ABC in
   1989-90.)


>> "So let me give you the 911!"

Benjamin Robinson explains what on earth Homer meant by his 911 remark:
   When Homer said "the 911," he really wanted "the 411," which is the
   slang for "the information."  In the United States, 411 is the number
   for information and directory assistance.


>> I'm just a grouch sitting on the couch...

That green thing in the trashcan during the episodes main musical number
   was none other than Oscar the Grouch, from TV's "Sesame Street," the
   popular young children's show. On the show Oscar is grouch who lives in
   a trashcan.


>> Wan... ker?

Younger readers, stop here and view another capsule.  Gone? Good.  "Wanker"
   is a British insult used not by children, but by teen/adult folk. For those
   unclear on what it means (which will be most of the non-Brits reading
   this), to "wank" is to "masturbate," so "wanker" inevitably means
   "masturbator".  Due to the confusion around the term in North America,
   the censors let this one slip, but in the UK the mention of the word was
   cut, and hasn't been put back in on any of its syndicated screenings. For
   what it's worth, Sky allow words like "bastard," "bitch," etc.


>> Unheard voices

Dale G. Abersold: Marcia Wallace got a voice credit again.  Did Edna say
   anything in the episode?  I'm wondering if Ms. Wallace has a new contract
   that states she gets a special guest voice credit for every episode Mrs.
   Krabappel appears onscreen, whether or not she actually says anything.


>> Goofs that will plague us forever

As of tonight's episode, there will be a bunch of goofs that will
   undoubtedly be made in future episodes:

   - Springfield will no longer be next to Shelbyville, unless of course
     the stench of the garbage ruins is too much for them, in which case
     they'd have to move five miles down the road, too. Wouldn't <that>
     be conveinient.

   - Moving the power plant would be impossible. Will Burns rebuild from
     scratch? Most probably, although I doubt we'll actually <see> it
     being done.

   - Somehow they'll have found a way of moving their basements.

   - Ye Old Fishin' Hole? Springfield Gorge?  Gone for the sake of a
     cheap gag, although their exact doubles will be found down the road.     


>> Lyrics to "The Garbageman" {je}

   Oh, the garbage man can, Marge.  The garbage man can . . .
   Who can take your trash out?
   Stomp it down for you.
   Shake the plastic bag and do the twisty-thingy too?
   The garbage man . . . oh, the garbage man can.

   The garbage man can and he does it with a smile and never judges you.

   Marge: Who can take this diaper?
   GM: I don't mind at all.
   Wiggum: Who can clean me up before the big policemans' ball?
   The garbage man . . . yes, the garbage man can.

   U2:
   The sanitation folks
   are jolly, friendly blokes.
   Courteous and easygoing!
   They mop up when you're overflowing . . .
   and tell you when your arse is showing!
   Apu: Who can?
   Mel: Who can?
   Ned: Who can?
   Oscar: Who can?
   The garbage man can!
   Bart & Lisa: 'Cause he's Homer Simpson man!

   He cleans the world for . . . YOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!


>> Meta References

Benjamin Robinson looks at the blackboard/couch gag:  For the couch gag,
   Bart writes "I will not mess with the opening credits," on the old
   chalkboard.  Would that the production staff felt the same way:  They've
   been shortened, lengthened, and the blackboard quote itself made a
   (thankfully temporary) hiatus.

Haynes Lee:  It's most likely a reference to how ending credits are screwed
   up when the Fox affiliate butts in with a split screen. And Bart was
   writing in two columns.


>> Where is Springfield?

Jordan Eisenberg: A map appeared on the walls on several occasions that
   depicts a large peninsula protruding from the left to fill most of the
   map.  Suggestions, anybody?

Andrew Gill: About 5 mi down the road, I guess...


>> Scenes likely to be cut in syndication

Haynes Lee: The "ash-hole" remark.


>> Thoughts

Benjamin Robinson:

   - Here's an odd p-code coincidence:  Both this season's "09" episode and
     last season's ("Grade School Confidential (4F09)") aired <way> out of
     order.

   - One of the men at the door, the one who asks, "Where have you been,"
     was drawn pretty realistically.  Does he represent some real-life person?

   - The Springfield Shopper is fifty cents?  Why, that's inflation for you.
     I remember when it was free!

   - "Sanford & Son" was a mid-Seventies series about a junk dealer.  Pretty
     appropriate choice for a sanitation commissioner, no?


>> Musical references

   + "Love Will Keep Us Together" by Captain and Tenille
      - Care Bears music {hl}

   + "Für Elise" composed by Beethoven
      - the music Lisa plays in her mental jukebox

   + "Pride" by U2

   + "Candy Man" by the late Sammy Davis Jr

   + "Sanford and Son theme" {hl}


>> Details on the musical references

Tony Hill sheds some light on some of the musical references in this
   episode:

   "Love Will Keep Us Together," words by Howard Greenfield, music by Neil
   Sedaka was introduced by Sedaka in 1973.  It became a big hit in 1975 in
   a recording by the Captain & Tennille (not of "Simpson Tide" fame).  For
   a lot of people it epitomizes the crassness of a lot of 70s music.

   Lisa's escape music is Beethoven's "Für Elise," a piece which bears her
   name, sort of.

   "The Candy Man," written by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, was
   introduced by Gene Wilder in the 1972 film "Willy Wonka and the
   Chocolate Factory" and was a number one hit for Sammy Davis Jr. (whom
   Bart is not a reincarnation of) that same year.  It did seem to me that
   OFF changed the song just enough so they can't get sued.  They didn't
   stick close enough to the original music to suggest it was an authorized
   parody.

Marge: Homer, this has gone far enough!  Will you please just apologize to

Lisa:  Yeah, Dad, you're always telling me and Bart to apologize.
Homer: Yeah, but I'm always secretly disappointed when you do.  Anyway, I

Marge: Aw, Homer, you didn't beat City Hall!  They picked up our trash 
       because I wrote a letter of apology to the Sanitation Commissioner,
       and signed your name.  Period.
Homer: [hurt] You signed my name?  I feel so violated.
Marge: You've signed my name lots of times!
Homer: But this isn't like a loan application or a will!  You've signed away

       [quieter, but still over PA] You're gonna get such a beating!
-- Where did it go wrong? "Trash of the Titans"

% At the nuclear plant, Homer greets his fellow workers as they come through
% the gates, encouraging them to vote for him.  Lenny and Carl walk up.

Lenny: So, Homer, if we vote for you, what are you going to do different?
Homer: What am I, the answer man?  Just vote for me.
Lenny: [walking off with Carl] Heh, you know, I don't know Ray Patterson,
       but, he's no Ray Patterson!
Carl:  Yeah, Homer's a great nuclear safety inspector, but I don't know if
       I trust him with my garbage.
Lenny: Yeah, that's a peace of mind issue, you know...
-- "Trash of the Titans"

% As Lenny and Carl head off to work, Homer decides that educating these
% "geezers" is a wasted effort, and declares that it's time to "rock the 
% vote"...at a U2 concert at Springfield Stadium.  At the backstage door, 
% Homer attempts to gain entry, disguised in a plaid cap, a jacket, and
% carrying a big brown sack. He gets inside, posing as potato man.
% Backstage, in the control room, a female with a shaven head directs the
% camera crew through a headset.  Homer wanders in and starts messing with the
% controls, where he encounters a female technician. She tries to stop him.
% Homer kicks her (wheeled) chair off camera as she screams.  He then
% manages to rig the controls so that his giant head appears on the three 
% screens behind the stage, interrupting U2's "Pride (In The Name of Love)".
% Homer appears on the large screen, and spreads his message, trying to
% sound hip.  Homer comes out on stage, and the crowd boos him, until Bono
% speaks up.  The rest of the band decide they'll go to Moes for a pint.
% The Edge and Larry stop and look at Adam as they walk off, who whistles 
% and fiddles with a knob on his bass guitar.  Meanwhile, Bono, with Homer at 
% his side, addresses the crowd.

Bono:  Why should they vote for you?
Homer: That's a good question, Bono.  'Cause I'd be the most whack, tripped
       out sanitation commissioner ever!  Can you dig it?
       [The crowd is quiet; we hear some crickets chirping.  After a few
        moments, the crowd begins booing again.  Homer, unsure of what to do, 
        starts dancing half-heartedly.]
-- At the U2 concert, "Trash of the Titans"

[into microphone] Wow, look at him go.  You're the real Lord of the Dance,
Homer.
-- Bono, of U2, "Trash of the Titans"

% Bono motions to some security guards standing by and points to Homer.  
% They take Homer off, kicking and screaming, calling to Bono for help.

[into mic] Don't worry, folks.  He'll get the help he needs.
-- Bono, on Homer, "Trash of the Titans"

% By this time, the rest of the band is back, and they finish the song.
% On the screen above the band, four security guards pummel Homer, punching 
% and kneeing him repeatedly.  Later, in Moe's bar, Homer moans about his 
% problems.

Homer: [melancholy] My campaign is a disaster, Moe. [angry] I hate the
       public so much! [melancholy] If only they'd elect me. [angry] I'd
       make 'em pay! [melancholy] Aw, Moe, how do I make 'em like me?
Moe:   Eh, gee, you're kind of all over the place, Homer, you need to focus 
       here.  You gotta...think hard, and come up with a slogan that appeals
       to all the lazy slobs out there.
Homer: [moans] Can't someone else do it?
Moe:   "Can't someone else do it?", that's perfect!
Homer: It is?
Moe:   Yeah!  Now get out there and spread that message to the people!
Homer: Woo hoo! [walks off]
Moe:   Woah, hey, you didn't pay for the beer.
Homer: "Can't someone else do it?"
       [Moe and Homer laugh together.  As Homer starts to leave the tavern,
        Moe cocks and points a shotgun at him and clears his throat.]
Moe:   Seriously, give me the money.
-- Foreshadowing a la Moe, "Trash of the Titans"

% The next day, standing by the Jebediah Springfield statue, Homer talks
% with the people of Springfield.

% Homer stands before a crowd, and explains his "can't someone else do it"
% philosophy. Homer unveils a banner with his catch-phrase on it.  The crowd
% seems to agree.

% Later, Homer stands behind a podium on stage.  An empty one stands to
% Homer's right.  Patterson hasn't arrived, Homer says he had more important
% things to do, and makes gulping noises and drinks from an imaginary bottle.
% The crowd laughs.  Suddenly, Ray Patterson bursts through the door, panting.
% Patterson arrives late, as Homer jokes with the crowd.

% The crowd discusses the matter with themselves.  Later, a newspaper
% headline informs us of Homer's landslide victory.  Homer, seeing the 
% headline through the window of a newspaper vending machine, says "Woo
% hoo!"

Lisa:  Aren't you gonna buy it, Dad?
Homer: Fifty cents?  Huh, not likely.
-- Homer sees himself on the cover of the newspaper, "Trash of the Titans"

[End of act two.  Time: ]

% Homer whistles as he visits his new office.  He sees Ray Patterson, who
% is just leaving. Homer tries to make peace with him, but fails.
% Ray walks off.  Later, Homer, at his desk, is talking on the phone.  As
% he talks, he motions for the rest of the Simpsons, who have come into his 
% office, to come closer, as he talks on the phone, and finishes his call.
% Homer explains he has a lot of crazy promises to fulfill, and they will.
% With a snap of the fingers, Homer appears on top of a garbage truck
% and directs it out of the Sanitation Department facility.  Music plays, 
% and Homer sings his song to the tune of "The Candyman Can".
% Music continues.
% Krusty laughs nervously as two happy garbage man dispose of his "used up 
% pornography" in their truck, and drive off, waving their hats.  For the 
% next segment of the song, Marge offers one of Maggie's soiled diapers to 
% Bart and Lisa, who refuse it and hold their noses.
% Garbage men rush in and wipe up mustard stains on Chief Wiggum's 
% tuxedo.  At Moe's bar, the band U2 enjoys a beer.
% A garbage man mops the bar counter free of spilled beer.  Another whispers
% to Bono during The Edge's line.  It seems that while sitting at Moe's bar,
% U2's trousers have sagged a bit.
% Outside, a parade of garbage trucks, with Homer at the lead on top of
% a garbage bin, get cheered on by people lining the streets.  Popping their
% heads out of trash cans are Apu, Mel, Ned, and Oscar.
% Bart and Lisa run up to Homer's side, who leads the parade into the
% Springfield Dump.
% When the song ends, we see Homer humming the tune in his office.  The 
% Mayor bursts in angrily.

Quimby: Simpson, you idiot!  You spent your entire year's budget in a month!
        Your department's broke!
Homer:  [panics] Uh...oh no!  Wait!  I think I've got the perfect solution.
Quimby: You'd better!  'Cause those garbage men won't work for free!
Homer:  D'oh!  
-- Bright ideas, "Trash of the Titans"

% At home, Homer is losing confidence.  Marge goes over his expenses while
% sitting on the couch with Bart and Lisa.

Homer: Oh...Patterson was right!  I'm crashing and burning!
       Crashing and burning!
Marge: How could you spend 4.6 million dollars in a month?
Homer: They let me sign checks with a stamp, Marge!  A stamp!
Lisa:  You know, Dad, there's a lesson in all this.  Many cities have
       problems with garbage disposal, and it's time we realize you can't
       just...
Homer: Wait!  Shut up!  I just thought of something!
-- Homer think now, "Trash of the Titans"

% Homer runs out the door and drives away.  The next day, Homer, at his
% desk, is confronted by the sanitation workers.  One holds a baseball bat
% in his hands. They demand their pay.
% Homer opens a briefcase full of money on his desktop.

Homer:       Will cash be okay?
Employee #1: Will it!
Quimby:      [opens office door] Did I hear a, uh, briefcase opening?
-- Pavlovian Quimby, "Trash of the Titans"

% Homer drives with his family at night.

Homer: Okay, before I show you, who wants to guess how I got the money?
Bart:  Dealing drugs?
Lisa:  Drugs?
Marge: I'll have to say drugs, too.
Homer: Close, but you're way off.
-- "Trash of the Titans"

% Homer pulls the car onto an off-ramp to the "Outskirts" of Springfield.
% He shows his family his idea: garbage trucks from around the country are
% lined up, and each dumps its contents in front of a mine shaft.  A bulldozer
% crams the trash inside.
% Bart points at a dump truck from the city of New York, which spills various
% kinds of drug paraphernalia, as well as guns and grenades, on the ground 
% next to the mine shaft.

Marge: Good God, Homer!  You're turning our wonderful little town into
       America's trash hole!
Homer: Marge!  Ixnay on the ashhole-tray!
-- Ashhole? "Trash of the Titans"

% Lisa tells Homer that he can't cram garbage under Springfield forever, but
% Homer insists that he can.  Later, he plays golf with Mayor Quimby.
% Mayor Quimby putts.  Underground, a mound of garbage bubbles up and 
% pushes a section of the green up, knocking the Mayor's putt off its path.
% Out of the hole shoots a stream of garbage.  Quimby runs over to 
% investigate.
% The Mayor turns to Homer, who is driving off in their golf cart.  
% Elsewhere in Springfield, Ned, Rod and Todd prepare to say good-bye to 
% a dear departed pet rabbit, whom they have buried in the yard.
% The ground rumbles, sending the rotting corpse of Mr. Bunny up to ground
% level, its mouth wide open.  Rod and Todd scream.  At the home of Cletus
% and Brandine, a pile of garbage knocks over their outhouse.  Cletus opens
% the door and pokes his head out.

% On the streets of Springfield, chaos erupts, as fire hydrants explode
% garbage water and trash shoots out of mailboxes and manholes.  Outside City
% Hall, where a town meeting is in progress, the statue of Jebediah lies
% overturned in a pile of rubbish.  "Aye!" the crowd shouts at Quimby and 
% Homer, standing on stage at the meeting.  Quimby suggests re-electing
% Ray Patterson.  The crowd lets out a cheer.  A triumphant Mr. Patterson
% strides out onto the stage and stands at the podium while a band plays.

Oh...oh, gosh...you know, I'm not much on speeches, but it's so gratifying to
leave you wallowing in the mess you've made.  You're screwed, thank you, bye.
-- Ray Patterson, "Trash of the Titans"

% Mr. Patterson walks off as the band plays the same song used to introduce
% him.  The crowd stares silently. Quimby reassures the crowd.
% At that very moment, the Mayor's podium explodes, shooting trash into
% the air and soaking him.  It seems the town will have to use... Plan B.
% Quimby reaches into his jacket and extracts a large yellow envelope, 
% breaking the "B" seal.  He opens it.  Later, Homer eats potato chips at
% the front door of his house.

Marge: I can't believe it's come to this.
Homer: Come to what?
Marge: Moving the whole town five miles down the road, it's crazy!
Homer: Yeah, it's something all right.
-- "Trash of the Titans"

% Lisa argues that they'll just trash the new Springfield.
% Homer jumps out the front door, and hops over to Moe's bar, which is
% being driven down the street right next to the Simpsons' house.  As the
% houses pass, Homer throws the empty potato chip bag out the window, which 
% floats through the air.  It lands at the feet of a lone Native American, 
% standing at the side of the road.  A tear wells up in his eye.  Another 
% Indian approaches him and says, "Do yourself a favor; don't turn around,"
% for behind him sits the remains of the old city of Springfield, covered
% in garbage, at which we take one last look.  After a brief pause, a four 
% second off-camera scream is heard, followed by the second Indian's voice.  
% "I told you not to turn around." he says.

[End of act three.  Time:]

% Over the credits, the members of U2 sit on an aeroplane.  The Edge,
% seated to the left of Bono, strums his guitar.  Adam pokes his head over the
% seat in front of Bono, and takes a spoon out of a paper bag.

Adam:      Look, guys.  I got a Springfield spoon for my spoon collection.
The Edge:  Aw, 'ere we go...  
Bono:      How many spoons have you got now, Adam?
Adam:      Nine.  If I didn't have my spoons, I'd go insane.
Bono:      Can I see it?
           [Adam hands him the spoon; Bono promptly throws it behind his
            head.]
Adam:      My spoon!
           [the spoon lands on the head of Charles Montgomery Burns, who sits
            in the seat directly behind The Edge.]
Mr. Burns: [muttering] Wankers.

Hari's final thought:  Bah. What can I say? Homer had the chance to make
   Springfield's sanitation grand, but blew it because of the almighty
   dollar. My advice is to think about what you've got, and use it wisely,
   because it could be gone in no time. Take care of yourself, and each other.
