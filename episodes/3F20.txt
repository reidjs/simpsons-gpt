=======================================================================

    Marge and Homer staunchly support a proposal to deport all illegal
    immigrants from Springfield, until they learn it would affect Apu,
    who buys fraudulent identification documents from Fat Tony (voice
    of Joe Mantegna).

=======================================================================
> Opening Sequence
=======================================================================

>> COUCH SCENE

     Homer is a carpet and the other Simpsons' heads are mounted on
     a wall; a hunter carrying a gun comes in and sits on the couch.
     He sets his gun next to the couch and lights his cigar.

=======================================================================

= In the first scene of the episode, the bear was standing at an 
  intersection, that promply disappeared.  Also, the house on the
  corner looked like the old Simpson place.  Of course, it could be
  track housing.  {mar}

= When Homer is watching TV, you can see directly through one of the
  house's front windows through a doorway, but one of the walls of the
  TV room should have its own front window (so you shouldn't be able to
  see the front of the house from the TV room through a doorway)  {ddg}

= There was no writing on the mailbox until Homer said "Impson family."
  {mar}

* When Homer rolled away from the house after Bart grabbed his pants
  and he fell, his pants should not have landed directly on top of him.
  {ddg}

* I'm not sure how Principal Skinner could have phoned ahead for a
  spur-of-the-moment mob.  [I think that was the joke --ed]  {vm}

= During the first dining room table scene, the close-ups had everyone 
  eating pie, while the long shots still had them eating dinner.  {mar}

= When Homer opens the envelope with his pay statement, the envelope
  instantly disappears, leaving just the statement.  {ddg}

= Why would Kearney need a fake ID when he's apparently not a minor?
  (See 3F13.)  {jl}

* There is an Indian Institute of Technology in 5 Indian cities, but
  Calcutta is not one of them.  {hl}

= While we see the full scoop on how Apu came to enter the United
  States, no mention is made of Sanjay and his children.  What about
  them?  {vm}

* What, nobody involved with the show has a passport?  Apu's did not
  have an expiration date, and all of the words were in English whereas
  a real passport has them in French as well.  {ddg}

* Apu's birthday in his fake passport is January 9, 1962, which can't
  be true considering it's been at least 16 years (nine for studies
  plus seven since his student visa expired) since he started graduate
  school.  {ddg}

- Apu's head is drawn much larger than usual when he says "Store credit
  only".

+ Selma's former marriage surname order was Terwilliger, then McClure
  in 3F15; now, Hutz is between them.  {vm}

+ Homer was registered to vote in 2F02, and you can't become
  "unregistered", yet he claims he's not registered now.  {ddg}

= On the first shot of the map, Michigan is colored orange, but it is 
  colored blue in the closeup.  {jh}

= Apu falls asleep in his open book with pages facing upward; when he
  wakes up the book is closed; in another shot, the book is open again
  with pages facing downward.  {am}
   
= During the long shot, Apu's book is not only back open, but there's a
  pen and paper on the table.  {mar}

= During the party scene, Dr. Riviera was first not at the picnic
  table, then there with no coat, then with a white coat, then with a
  brown coat, then gone.  {mar}

+ Apu has been summoned to jury duty before (see 1F19).  {jh}

>> Other References

Here are some references that don't fit anywhere else:

    Yoo-Hoo for Ganeesha: Haynes Lee: "There was a religious Hindu
    craze in India last year when the religious elephant statues drunk
    milk."

    Abe sees the Statue: Haynes Lee: "Chrysler chief Lee Iaoccoca
    immigrated from Italy and his first sight of America was the Statue
    of Liberty."

>> 24 = 187

The Prop. 24 controversy mirrors this real-life California proposition.
    Benjamin J. Robinson remarks, "Proposition 187 was one of the most
    divisive issues on the 1994 California ballot.  Essentially, it
    sought to deny government services -- such as education, and
    medical aid -- to people who had entered this country illegally.
    Backers of the new law said that it would stop the drain of public
    money by people who weren't even supposed to be in the country in
    the first place.  Opponents argued that this proposition unfairly
    punished people who were quietly trying to make a better life in
    America, and would not be of much benefit to the public treasury,
    either.  Since most immigrants -- legal and otherwise -- in
    California were of Hispanic or Latino descent, some Prop. 187
    opponents saw the law as racially motivated."  Jose Lafaurie notes  
    as well, "If your name sounded Spanish or you looked Spanish, the
    police could rightfully pull you over and ask for your green card
    under this law."  Proposition 187 passed at the polls and should
    have taken effect January 1st of 1995, but was recently overturned
    by the courts.

Benjamin Robinson adds, "No one ever spelled out what Proposition 24
    would do, but it appears that it gave the police the power to
    deport anyone who was not either a citizen or a legal immigrant.
    Ironically, they are already allowed to do this under federal
    immigration law.  (Well, actually, I think Springfield's finest
    would have to tip off INS rather than deporting people themselves.)
    Therefore, Prop. 24 is actually redundant."

Don Del Grande asks rhetorically, "If Proposition 24 deports people
    `from Springfield', why not just have the illegal immigrants go to
    Shelbyville?"  They hate the town enough to dump their problems
    there.  See 2F20 and 2F22.

Chris Courtois adds, "The main concept was to discourage illegal
    immigration by prohibiting illegal aliens from receiving any public
    moneys, including welfare, medical care, or public schooling.
    Notably absent from the proposition were any sanctions against the
    employers that hire illegal aliens. (Rush was spouting that all
    these aliens are not getting jobs as busboys, maids, and migrant
    farm workers, but are risking everything so they can go on welfare,
    a belief satirized with Apu's "Which way to the welfare office"
    line). The proposition also coincided with governor Pete Wilson's
    bid for reelection. Prior to the campaign, polls indicated only 2%
    of Californians were strongly concerned about illegal immigration.
    Wilson attached himself to the proposition and began hyping it,
    essentially turning an issue with which no one was concerned into
    the centerpiece of his campaign, while conveniently ignoring real
    issues like California remaining in a recession while the rest of
    the country was recovering. (Similar to Quimby diverting attention
    from the bear tax complaints to illegal immigrants).  A third
    parallel was as election day approached, proposition 187 became
    "politically incorrect" and only the most vehement dittoheads would
    publically admit to supporting it; however, come election day, the
    proposition passed with a huge majority (Just like crowds of
    Springfieldians chanting their opposition but 95% of them voting
    "yes".) One last parallel to the California election was pondering
    a proposition which contained laws already on the books. In the same
    election, California voters were asked to vote on the "3 strikes
    law", which had already been approved and enacted by the legis-
    lature several months back."
    
>> Product Placement Corner -- brought to you by Nike

Benjamin Robinson notes, "That bottle of Yoo Hoo Apu offered to Ganesha
    sure was realistically drawn, wasn't it?  (Yoo Hoo is some sort of
    chocolate-flavored soda concoction.)  Perhaps it is the favorite
    drink of the animation staff."

>> I'll be X's, you be O's

Benjamin Robinson says, "Contrary to what Apu thinks, the problem of
    computerized tic-tac-toe has been pretty well solved.  Indeed, one
    of my assignments in my sophomore year was to write a tic-tac-toe
    program.  The instructors took off points if they could beat your
    program.

    "Also, Apu's punch cards should have had sequence numbers on them.
    These numbers told you which card went first, which went second,
    and so on.  People in the punch card days weren't so accident-free
    that they never dropped decks of cards.  Therefore, several columns
    on the end of the card were reserved for a sequence number.  If the
    cards got out of order, you could put them in a card sorter, which
    would re-order them for you.  Or maybe it would just mangle them
    completely -- it was all in the hands of fate.

    "If you ever wrote code in FORTRAN-77 you may have wondered why
    your statements couldn't go past column 72.  It's because columns
    73 through 80 were reserved for the sequence number.  The
    restriction was kept even as FORTRAN gradually moved from cards to
    video terminals.  [Perhaps this is why my crappy NeXT computer  
    limits all my lines to 72 columns.  --ed]  Fortran-90 now gives you
    the option of coding past column 72."

>> Where you're coming from

Benjamin Robinson says, "Evidently, Lisa might not know (or might
    dispute) the Land Bridge theory.  This theory holds that the native
    Americans walked over -- immigrated, if you will -- an isthmus of
    land that used to exist between Russia and Alaska.  The land was
    covered over when the oceans rose.  Furthermore, according to a
    growing body of evidence, humans originated in Africa, and then
    emigrated to every other point on the globe.  So not only is
    America a nation of immigrants, but so is Canada, Mexico, France,
    China, India, Japan...."

>> All about India where their clothes are different from ours

Jason Hancock notes, "The size of the student body at the Calcutta
    Institute of Technology is a reference to India's large population
    (about 937 million, according to the 1996 World Almanac, which
    places it only behind China).  On top of that, Calcutta is one of
    the world's largest and most overcrowded cities with some 11
    million people (even though it's only India's second largest city,
    behind Bombay)."

Balaji Gadhiraju says of the Yoo-Hoo drinking Ganesha, "Six months back
    the whole of India went crazy about a statue of Ganesha drinking
    milk when it was offered to him with spoons.  Later some people
    came up with theories why it happened.  One theory is as most of
    the statues are made of marble and because of surface properties
    of marble the milk when offered forms a very thin and invisible 
    (for the naked eye) layer and drips down. This really became a very
    big issue six months back in India."

He continues, "Though there are some snake charmers, mainly in villages
    and small towns, people generally dont play with them. It is not
    that you can see people playing with snakes everywhere."

    About Apu's betrothed: "This custom was practiced upto 100 years
    back and that too in only certain regions of india. Nowadays it is
    so rare that practically it is not existing. Also it is Illegal."

>> I'll be in the cold ground before I recognize New Mexicah

Jason Hancock says, "New Mexico became a state on January 6, 1912,
    while Arizona was admitted on February 14, 1912 (according to the
    World Almanac).  I don't think there actually was a 47-star flag
    like Homer showed Apu, as the flag went from 46 to 48 stars, but I
    do know there was a 49-star flag between the times Alaska and
    Hawaii became states."

>> Dial-a-Waltz

Jason Hancock says, "Homer's map was published by the National
    Geographic Society, judging by its design.  Although it looks like
    the animators must have used a black-and-white Xeroxed copy (as NGS
    maps are usually in full color), the details are there, including
    rivers, airports, and highways.  BTW, the elevations (509 in Iowa,
    595 in Wisconsin, and 376 in Illinois) given on the map are in
    meters, not feet, and represent each state's highest point."

>> Where is Springfield? (a.k.a. who is Chuckie Finster's mom?)

Jason Hancock says, "The continuing saga of `Where is Springfield?'
    shows that in this episode, Lisa seems to be pointing to an Eastern
    state which we can't see thanks to Bart's head.  (Will we EVER find
    out where Springfield is, or will this thread go on forever?)  It
    would have to be between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians,
    as we see the Atlantic coastal states in one shot.  But now, thanks
    to Lisa mentioning that Springfield is nowhere near Chicago, we
    know it is NOT in Illinois as some people on a.t.s have said.  So,
    at least in this episode, Springfield seems to be somewhere in the
    southeast."

Don Del Grande notes additionally, "We now know Springfield (or at
    least `this Springfield') is not in the Great Lakes region or in
    the western half of the country, although the USA map is missing
    `Five Corners'."

>> Moe Knows Zilch

Veronica Marquez ponders, "Maybe the writers want to keep us guessing
    about just where Moe is from?  In `Flaming Moe's', Moe seemed to
    be of British origin, since the waitress refered to him as `Morris'
    but, in `Bart's Inner Child', Moe's inner child chides him for
    not talking with an Italian accent.  So much for that.  But wait,
    in `The Springfield Connection', Moe is revealed to have some sort
    of Arabic origin since his real name is Mohamar.  Just where is
    Moe from?"

>> Uter is not alone

Don Del Grande says, "I don't know what happened during, say, Desert
    Storm, but what happened to Uter in school definitely happened to
    a number of Middle Eastern (not necessarily Iranian, either) kids
    where I went to high school during the 1979-81 Iranian hostage
    incident."

>> Homer's Tax Refund

From Don Del Grande:

	"Homer makes about $25,000/year
	Standard deduction $6550
	Five exemptions $12,500
	Taxable income: about $6000
	Federal tax owed: $904
	Federal tax withheld: $2925
	HOMER'S REFUND: about $2000"

    Now that's something we need to know later in life.  :-)

>> Entertainment Weekly (a phrase that might or might not fit OFS :-)

From Mark Richey, "Entertainment Weekly is a popular magazine dealing
    with, of all things, entertainment.  It's TV critic, Ken Tucker, is
    an unabashed fan of OFF.  An article last September, about the
    discussions about Who Shot Mr. Burns on a.t.s., first brought me to
    this newsgroup.
    
    "Tom Cruise is a hugely popular movie star.  Nicole Kidman is his
    mildly popular movie star wife.  It's highly probable that if they
    haven't been on EW's cover together before, they will be before
    long.

>> Cotton Mather

Homer's 9th grade history notes start with his name.  Cotton Mather was
    the son of minister Increase Mather (they got weird names, don't
    they?), who was a Harvard graduate and a peacher in the 1680's and
    1690's.  He very much advocated against spectre evidence in
    witchcraft trials, and for smallpox inoculations.  He published
    more than 400 works.

=======================================================================
> Reviews
=======================================================================

Dale Abersold - Based on who the writer and director are, I was not
    expecting very much from this episode (they have produced some of
    my least favorite eps).  Much to my surprise, they put together
    this wonderful piece of political satire.  Homer's pro-immigrant
    speech at the end was a classic.  Grade: A-.

Chris Courtois - "Much Apu About Nothing" was a welcome return to the
    satirical tone of the early seasons which made me a fan of the
    show.  While not quite up to those lofty levels (it was a little
    too preachy and obvious in some spots, and OFF took a back seat to
    the "message"), it was certainly one of the strongest efforts of
    this season. As a Californian who went through the whole
    Proposition 187 scenario (the obvious model for Proposition 24) I
    found the jabs insightful, and downright hilarious. Even the anti-
    bear hysteria was on target!! And finally a "message" episode where
    Lisa got to behave as a real character instead of a platitude-
    spouting PC thug. The new writers are learning.  Only the
    obviousness of some of the moralizing weakened this episode. A-.

Don Del Grande - Better than usual, once the bear stuff was out of the
    way (although seeing Ned in a raging panic was a refreshing change)

Jason Hancock - Like last week, another mixed bag here.  The "Where is
    Springfield?" map gag was pretty funny when I realized it was a
    slam at one of the two a.t.s threads that will never die.  But
    aside from that (and the  bear scene, which had _nothing_ to do
    with the plot), the laughs were few and far between.  Lots of good
    FFF/DYN material here as well, but other than that, average.
    Grade:  C+.

Haynes Lee - A different type of episode with more substance but less
    of the references. However the linking material was weak. Jumping
    from bears to immigrants was a bit much of a non sequitur. GRADE:
    B

Adam Lipkin - Well, It was an odd way to get the main plot of the show,
    but once they did, man oh man was it a good one.  Everything from
    thinly veiled profanity to a dig at us here on a.t.s. Oh, and lots
    of great lines and laughs. Grade A all the way.

Veronica Marquez - This episode should have been hilarious to me for
    all sorts of reason, but it just didn't gel.  My grade is a D.

Mark Richey - A ridiculous plot makes for a subpar episode.  While I
    guess that it was supposed to be funny that banning illegal
    immigrants is a moot point, it simply wasn't funny.  Like [3F19]
    (...Flying Hellfish), this was an episode sorely in need of a
    subplot.  Grade: C

Benjamin J. Robinson - A refreshing surprise -- a message episode that
    doesn't get bogged down with the message.  "Much Apu About
    Nothing" makes its point, largely manages to avoid preachiness, and
    is consistently funny to boot.  The stories of Grampa's and Apu's
    past are the highlights, as is the answer (nudge, nudge, wink,
    wink) to the question of Springfield's location.  (B+)

Robert Gretta - [Responding to above] I wish that I saw the same
    episode that you did.  The one they televised here was horrible.
    D-.  [...] I think someone stole all the Simpson characters that
    I've known and loved and replaced them with humorless liberal
    zombies (I'm NOT a republican).  Even the animation of this episode
    was terrible.  This was by far the worst Simpsons show I had ever
    seen. In fact, if "She's the Sheriff" were on I would have turned
    the channel.

Matt Rose - Professor Frink in the 70's had me ROTF. I thought this
    episode was a bit void of jokes, but I liked the story idea. I also
    liked the bear thing at the beginning. (Was that Gentle Ben?)  I
    also was glad to see Lisa acting more like herself again. Overall,
    this one wasn't as good as 3F18, but it was better than last weeks.
    Still, it was good enough to keep the recent string of good
    episodes going. 3 stars (out of 5),  or if you want a letter grade,
    B+.

Glen Ryan - Grade: C-. I dunno, I just like the old days, and there
    just wasn't much to the episode...I might be flamed for this, but
    IMO if they can't consistently put out better material than this,
    OFF should be allowed to pass on before it turns to utter boring
    sitcom-style drek... 

Rick Senger - While this one had it's heart in the right place, it was
    too preachy at the expense of humor.  It displayed both sides of a
    highly controversial issue with some of the usual Simpsons wit and
    style, but it needed more jokes and less moralizing.  Due to the
    low volume of audible laughs in the group I saw it with, I would
    have to mark this as one of the lesser episodes this season in
    terms of entertainment value, although the political message was
    well-presented IMO.  C+.

Yours Truly - Much of the sentiment was direct and maudlin (even when
    it wasn't), and the question of where is Springfield was dodged
    more directly than usual, but the topic (anti-immigration fever)
    was long needed.  I'm a resident of California and went through all
    the Prop. 187 crap, so I can relate.  As far as the bear goes, it
    was useless (like the trampoline in 1F05).  I'm giving it a B+.

AVERAGE GRADE: C+/B- (2.65)
