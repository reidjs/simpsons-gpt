> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   (Canadian):  At a screening of his new movie, Mel Gibson takes Homer's
   critical opinions to heart and offers to fly the Simpsons to Hollywood
   where he asks the Ebert-in training to review a re-edited version of his
   film.  {hl}

Blackboard:     FRIDAYS ARE NOT \ "PANTS OPTIONAL"

Couch:          The Simpsons, drawn as they were in the Ullman era, sit on the
                couch.  Suddenly, they are joined by ... the Simpsons, drawn
                as they are today.  Confronted with one another, the two sides
                scream and run away.

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... we can see movie posters for "Space Mutants XII" and "McBane [sic] VI"
       in the theater lobby?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Maggie sits in the back seat?
   ... the plane managed to land without taking out any mailboxes?

Joe Green:
   ... "She's Having a Baby ... Again"?

Richard E. Green:
   ... Capt. McAllister on the pier?
   ... the "Braveheart" poster in the editing room?

Tony Hill:
   ... the divers sink but the car's other victims float?
   ... the comic book guy's mouse ball bouncing?
   ... it was Wiggum who started the rush on Gibson?
   ... Marge wears her wedding ring on her "middle" finger?
   ... [the President] arriving at the West Front of the Capitol unescorted?
   ... the comic book guy has switched to a portable computer?

Darrel Jones:
   ... Lulu Van Houten sits behind Homer at the screenplay?
   ... when Homer and Marge leave the screenplay, we can see Apu, Manjula and
       Sanjay talking?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Maggie is temporary shaken off the couch when the plane lands next to
       the Simpsons' house?

Haynes Lee:
   ... this  is the first audible flatulence?
   ... this is the first celebrity mooning?

Adam Long:
   ... Homer refers to Earth as "your planet?"
   ... Luann Van Houten and Pyro are still together?
   ... Mel comes to OFF's door with that celebrity "fake-smile," much like
       Troy McClure's?
   ... Marge rubs her wrist after Homer grabs it?
   ... John Travolta's jet has a horn?
   ... Anne Heche isn't wearing shoes?
   ... the ominous versions of "You're a Grand Old Flag" and "Hail to the
       Chief" in the new ending?

Patrick McGovern:
   ... Homer is apparently a member of the press in the movie?
   ... the cars in the museum all seemed to still be functional?  (Alright,
       THIS is nitpicking)

Tom Rinschler:
   ... an incredibly large amount of scenes with Maggie?  (it seemed she
       appeared more in this episode then all of last season!)

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Homer goes to church once a week, and he likes to (try to) fix things
       around the house, so he's two-thirds of the way to being Mel Gibson?

Evan Ross:
   ... Mayor Quimby leaves the movie with a woman other than his wife?
   ... when Mel Gibson says "Love thy Neighbor", Rev. Lovejoy appears next to
       Homer?
   ... Krusty can be seen in the opening shot of the audience?
   ... all the lamps in Homer and Marge's bedroom are exactly the same?

Mike Smith:
   ... it's the first episode written by Mike Scully since "Lisa's Date With
       Destiny" (4F01)?
   ... Maggie Roswell still with us (Hopefully, not for long -- I hope)?

        credits:  "A Spike Lee Joint"

   ~ "American Pie" (movie)  {gb}
      - Homer's reference to the "teen sex romp" movie sounds more like this

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  A weak offering of recycled themes of past, superior
   episode.  Like many other AABF episodes, this one featured the infamous
   "jerkass" Homer who is moronic and constantly angry for no apparent reason.
   And like the other AABF episodes, it treats Homer as if he were the only
   member of the Simpson family.  (D)

Greg Bigoni:  Several clever references to popular movies (especially Homer's
   "Lethal Weapon" analyses) and nice self-parodying from Mel Gibson do bring
   this a notch above the show's last attempt at Hollywood satire in "When You
   Dish Upon A Star."  Despite that, the constant barrage of celebrity
   appearances that The Simpsons has adopted is starting to get very old, and
   is allowing the family to drop further and further into the background.
   But because it made me laugh, it gets a  (B-)

Rich Bunnell:  Another "Homer gets a job and meets a celebrity" plot, but not
   that bad, just not spectacular.  It's nice to see Dr. Nick again for a
   brief second, and the "We're lesbians!" line is something which sounds
   stupid on paper but is actually rip-roaringly hilarious due to its complete
   randomness.  Some stupid stuff (such as basically the whole chase scene and
   the Travolta appearance) but a pretty solid ep by late standards. Haphazard
   compared to old seasons, but ... eh ... whatcha gonna do?  (B)

Ben Collins:  Yet another idiotic Jerkass Homer/Celebrity Guest episode.  Mel
   Gibson "teams up" with Homer for absolutely no reason to embark on a
   moronic project that's predictably destined for failure, "hilarity ensues,"
   etc.  For example, note how Homer forgets his jealousy and outright hatred
   of Mel and acts like his best buddy exactly when the imbecilic plot
   requires him to.  I give Mike Scully credit for the fact that he can, and
   has, done better than this.  (D)

Nathan Mulac DeHoff:  I suspect that the general opinion on this one is fairly
   negative, and my personal opinion isn't much better.  Most of the gags
   seemed to be closer to typical cartoon fare than is (or was, anyway)
   typical of the show.  The jet landing in the driveway, the car chase, and
   some other visual gags just didn't work that well.  Most of the rest of the
   episode was just random stupidity coming out of Homer's mouth.  Some of it
   was funny, and several of Homer's really dumb suggestions were amusing, but
   this stuff couldn't carry an entire episode.  I think Homer was hired as a
   script consultant for this episode.  (D+)

Nicolas Di Candia:  Beyond Blunderdome has many of the elements that made the
   show decline in the last few seasons.  It's the classic "Homer gets a wacky
   job and screws it" episode, packed with excessive guest star exposure.  It
   also has a car chase ending, which is unlikely to be found in any episode
   from the first seven seasons.  But it proved that these episodes can be
   very funny and entertaining.  I liked that they remembered to take the rest
   of the family to Hollywood (although they didn't do much) and the Space
   Mutants ad (first time we see the Space Mutants in years).  I have high
   hopes for this season and it began better than I expected.  (B-)

Jordan Eisenberg:  With a devilishly fast pace and the largest batch of
   cultural references I've ever seen in a TV show, "Beyond Blunderdome" is
   anything but boring.  But the problem is that this episode nothing else to
   offer ... it takes The Simpsons one step closer to being a much more astute
   "Family Guy."  From Homer's character to the gratuitous silliness to the
   lack of any really decent plot, it seems that all lingering threads of what
   The Simpsons was in its infancy are gone forever.  But at least it still
   offers a few belly-laughs every now and then.  (B-)

Richard E. Green:  Okay, I was probably too excited to finally see a NEW
   episode that I couldn't think too many negative thoughts, but I was not
   displeased with the season premiere.  [...] Act 1 was certainly the best of
   them.  [...] The comic book guy appearance was the best part of the
   episode, and I could really relate to him being thrown out (ever try to
   bring a laptop into a theatre?)  As usual, after the 1st act the show began
   to fall, and I thought the entire 3rd act was going to be laughless, until
   the very end with the dog.  I liked the voiceover in the Gracie logo, yet
   somehow saw it coming.  I thought that the Mel Gibson guest star was
   actually used well for once.  Overall I'd give it a  (B)

Tony Hill:  This was a hilarious ep.  The self-parody and the swipes at the
   Hollywood establishment were quite funny.  It was a typical ep which starts
   with something completely unrelated, but as usual the show's endings are
   the best on TV.  It's also funny Mel Gibson was willing to go along with
   all of that.  (A)

Kenneth J. Huck:  A pretty good episode overall, and I especially loved Homer
   and Mel's "movie".  However, at first I had a hard time finding the "star"
   of the ep.  Bart? Ha.  Marge?  Ha.  Lisa?  Double ha.  Maggie?  Has there
   EVER been an episode starring Maggie?  Homer?  Close, but until about the
   second act didn't do too much.  Then it came to me.  Mel Gibson was the
   star!  Now, isn't that something!  A guest playing more of a role than a
   regular!  Anyway the only thing that keeps me from giving it a perfect A+
   was it seemed to be following the "Homer the glorified buffoon" style of
   episode, a type that I, personally, loathe.  (B+)

Carl Johnson:  I had major doubts about this one, but was extremely surprised.
   I mean, effort went into this.  The story had the usual AABF problems, but
   that was just about all that was wrong with it.  It was extremely
   well-written, hilarious in places, and was, to an extent, plausible,
   character-wise.  The "new ending" scene in the middle of Act 2 was truly
   classic material.  I mean, that was "season four" hilarious.  Does this
   episode outshine "Lisa Gets an A", my previous vote for best AABF episode?
   Probably.  I'd have to see that one again, though.  But, I was in a bad
   mood before I watched "Beyond Blunderdome", and now I'm in high spirits
   again.  Good show, gov'nah!  (A+)

Darrel Jones:  Season Eleven's opener is a good (but not great) episode.
   Loved Act One, especially the stupid shock gags (God knows why).  I'm also
   glad jerkass, crazy-scheme Homer finally got screwed in the end.  I also
   liked a few little touches, like "Chinese Man's Theater" and the
   shifty-eyed dog.  Points off for the "Homer and Mel run from the producers"
   bit; too weird.  The movie deserved its fate.  (B)

Adam Long:  It was pretty good.  While there were some lame, non-Simpsonesque,
   and repeated gags (here comes 2) there were also plenty of hilarious
   moments  (She's Having a Baby ... Again, Chinese Man's Theater, the CBG).
   I liked Mel Gibson as well. I can't say it greatly thrilled me about the
   upcoming season, but it was entertaining.  I guess I expected a bit more
   from the season premiere, though.  (B)

Bill McNeal:  I'm really getting fed up with The Simpsons at this point.  I
   loved the first act of last night's ep, as I got to see many of my favorite
   characters (CBG: "How did you know?!").  The last two acts were
   unforgivable.  Why does Mike Scully assume that bigger gags and guest stars
   equals better episodes?  Mel Gibson?  Come on!  I would have been more
   satisfied if Adam West (again) and Burt Ward were actually recruited for
   those cameos.  No one needs Mel Gibson for a laugh.  I watch The Simpsons
   to see Springfield residents at their best, not to see a bunch of
   inconclusive jokes that I've already seen in Season Ten episodes!  And do
   we really need a new trip episode EVERY season?  I won't even get started
   on Tress MacNeille's latest disgracing of a Hollywood legend..  (C-)

Nick Orechwa:  This was not an impressive episode.  As hard as they tried to
   make Homer funny, he just wasn't.  This was also just another variation on
   7F16, and a mostly unfunny variation at that.  However, the episode did
   have some bright points, especially Homer's version of the Film, not to
   mention the whole idea of having Mel Gibson do a remake of "Mr. Smith goes
   to Washington".  (C)

Abhi Rey:  I have to say, this episode was much, much, much better than I
   thought it would be.  Of course, there were the usual problems we've got in
   the past 2 seasons: unsatisfying story, Homer screws up another job,
   crudeness, car chases, focus on guest stars.  However, there was comic
   energy, like the lesbians, the clip, the dog at the end, Dr. Nick, Batman
   and Robin, and many others.  Homer's preference to violent and lowbrow
   movies actually made sense and worked well into the story.  If there's
   going to be an episode that, as many people have complained, totally
   disregards plot and character, this is the best episode of the kind.  (C+)

Tom Rinschler:  Let's see, on the plus side: a linear plot, a great couch gag,
   and lots of Maggie.  On the minus side: not many laughs.  The plot overall
   was very similar to "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson" (Homer doing
   one thing while the rest of the family goes to see the sights), but there
   are much better episodes to emulate.  At least the rest of the family
   wasn't short-changed time-wise during Homer's escapades.  The storyline,
   while thankfully not meandering too much, unfortunately had little humor.
   Overall, a below-average effort.  (C+)

Matt Rose:  For the first time in memory, I couldn't have really cared less
   about the season premiere.  It makes me sad.  For what it is these days,
   this episode was pretty consistent with the Mike Scully sell-out era ...
   occasional mild laughs sandwiched between guest stars invited on the
   program only for the sake of adding another one to the celebrity guest
   list, a lot of cartoony sight gags that didn't work and a sad exploitation
   of characters that have lost most of their smart, human qualities and
   become completely one-dimensional.  Perhaps I wouldn't mind as much if show
   had always been like this, but watching early reruns never fail to hit home
   the reality that this once-great series has lost it's touch.  For the
   record I did enjoy a hearty chuckle at the Tracey Ullman couch gag.  (C-)

Jason Rosenbaum:  Two words to describe this episode: pretty good.  The plot
   was pretty good.  The jokes were pretty good.  Mel Gibson was pretty good.
   The ending was pretty good (albeit predictable).  Everything was pretty
   good.  Yep.  Pretty good.  (B)

Dan Touchette:  I expect one joke each episode to floor me and this time it
   was the Robert Downey Jr. gag.  Otherwise, OFF goes to Hollywood just
   didn't work this time.  I don't buy Mel Gibson would follow Homer's advice
   to make his movie more violent, nor did I think the new ending to "Mr.
   Smith" was funny.  I hope the guest stars won't drown the series this
   season.  (D)

Yours Truly:  The show's setup looked great, but the execution tended to
   emphasize the wrong things.  "The Simpsons" isn't an action-oriented show
   (like "Futurama" sometimes is), and "Blunderdome" would have been funnier
   with more insightful spoofing of the motion-picture biz.  Gibson's genial
   screen presence helps, as do a few funny gags here and there, but overall
   the new season is off to a slow start.  (C+)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Eleven -- count 'em -- eleven seasons

Ondre Lombard marks the occasion:  There's something special about an eleventh
   season.  It's one, or two years over the average long lasting lifespan of
   nine years.  It seems to say there's something above average about a TV
   show.  Simpsons is no exception. It is now joining the ranks of such
   brilliance as M*A*S*H, Cheers and other shows that reached 11+ seasons for
   one reason or another (even Married ... with Children, which taught the
   country to lighten up and recognize the sordid family life.)  OFF would
   still have gained its rightful place as an honorary long lasting TV program
   that did the medium justice even if it had ended after about eight non-
   shaky years, but alas, it prattled on, deciding that manufactured
   "situations" were better than honest, innocent down to Earth comedy.  And
   while this is so unfortunate, at least it got us here to year number
   eleven.


Jordan Eisenberg contributes an interesting perspective on the show's
   evolution:  I'll agree as much as the next guy that "The Simpsons" is no
   longer the writing powerhouse it used to be; that they are most definitely
   past their best years and in a decline ... but just looking at dozens of
   other shows from all corners of Prime Time this season and last, in which
   the driving force is either self-conscious avoidance of anything
   approaching "lame-ness," obviously network- and marketing-scripted plots,
   flat-out imitation of whatever else is popular, or perceived to be, or any
   other negative quality you'd like to accuse the Chattering Cyclops of ...
   the unabashed way in which new episodes The Simpsons flaunts themselves,
   with not much of a care for anything but throwing out diverse and (IMO)
   funny jokes one after another, while a huge departure from the subversive
   spirit of its old self, is refreshing in TV's current state.

   Not to try to generalize the entire show into a single statement, but "The
   Simpsons" has become, I think, what "The Family Guy" should be.  To say
   this is disappointing for anyone still clinging to the old Simpsons, which
   is essentially gone, and because what another show (of less cult-like
   status) should be is not what Simpsons should be ... but I suggest it to
   anyone out there who honestly wants to find some enjoyment out of Seasons
   Eleven and Twelve.


>> Writer Watch

Javier Vera:  Mike Scully is one of the best writers the show ever had,
   together with Dan Greaney and the Kogen-Wolodarsky duo.  His debut, "Lisa's
   Rival", got many mixed reviews, yet his next script "Lisa on Ice" was
   considered a classic, episode I loved due to its excellent ending.  He was
   also in charge of "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" and "Marge be not Proud",
   two episodes with mixed reviews.  But most people consider "Team Homer" as
   Scully's masterpiece in show story.  He was later in charge of "Lisa's Date
   With Density", the THOH short "The Homega Man" and was one of the
   contributors to "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday".


>> Meta-reference corner

Don Del Grande:  Homer says, "Now, in whatever year this is" -- that way, the
   episode isn't dated in reruns.  [{bjr} adds, " After all, doesn't it sound
   weird when some character on an old sitcom says, 'Hey get with the times!
   It's the 70s.'"


>> Now, shirts optional, that's another story

Tom Rinschler explains the blackboard gag:  The blackboard gag presumably
   refers to a recent change in business fashion.  Here in the US at least, it
   has become something of a tradition for businesses to have "casual
   Fridays", where the employees are allowed to wear something other than
   suits and other business wear. However, I would think very few businesses
   would allow a "pants optional" Friday.


>> Life Imitating "The Simpsons"

Haynes Lee:  Over the past summer JFK Jr. died in a private plane crash and
   most recently John Travolta had engine problems mid-flight.

   Also, Planet Hollywood has recently filed for bankruptcy protection.
   You're more likely to find bailiffs there now instead of Hollywood stars.


>> Life influenced by "The Simpsons"

Daniel L. Dreibelbis:  Just heard this on the radio -- the Ford Motor Company
   has pulled its ads from the Simpsons, in protest over the fact that Homer
   destroyed a car called "Electro-Taurus" in the season premiere "Beyond
   Blunderdome".  Ford, of course, makes the popular Taurus mid-sized car.

   Sounds like Herb Powell managed to get a job on Ford's Board Of Directors:)


>> Perhaps they'd sell more if they gave away free movie tickets

Jeff Cross:  The electric car was a good idea that just didn't pan out as well
   as the environmentalists expected. While they don't pollute, their range is
   something along the lines of a gasoline-powered car with a quarter of a
   tank left.  They also require special rechargers and take an entire night
   to charge.  The project isn't dead, though, as they are being targeted
   towards "niche markets" like park rangers or people who never leave the
   city.


>> What Matt Drudge does on a slow news day

Benjamin Robinson explains why internet spies aren't welcome at the movies:
   The internet and the movie making process crossed paths in an unexpected
   way recently.  For ages, movie studios have invited audiences for test
   screenings.  The process works pretty much like we see demonstrated on the
   show:  People watch a movie, and then fill out surveys on what they did or
   didn't like.  The final movie is then tweaked based on what people thought.
   (Or dumped to the direct-to-video market if it's really unsalvageable.)

   The sudden availability of internet access has become a problem for
   moviemakers.  Chances are, given an audience of reasonable size, that at
   least one person in the audience will later be on the internet, registering
   his disgust (or delight) with the film.  Producers probably don't mind if
   someone gives the movie high marks, but bad reviews can quickly build a
   negative buzz that sinks the film before it even opens.  Since the point of
   a test screening is to ferret out flaws in the film, producers would rather
   people keep their mouths shut until they can work in some improvements.
   "Hollywood Insider" web sites live or die on this kind of material, so the
   problem isn't likely to go away soon.


Jeff Cross explains how this "beta-testing" can change the ends of movies:
   JURASSIC PARK: Originally had just the two velociraptors.  The T-rex was
   added because they felt it was the real star of the film.

   STAR TREK: GENERATIONS: Originally Kirk just fell to his death without any
   real heroism.

   INDEPENDENCE DAY: Originally Russell Casse was flying his biplane into the
   city destroyer's cannon rather than an F/A-18.


Matt Ackeret reports:  Someone gave me a flier a year or so ago for a movie
   screening (it was for Species II -- by the time I called in they had
   already had enough people from my demo so I didn't get to go) ... and at
   the bottom they said something along the lines of "you promise not to
   report to any Internet web sites"..


Ondre Lombard:  Actually, the main problem with the Internet is that "nerds"
   of sorts bootleg movies using screeners of new films to create MPEGs or
   VCDs and distribute them throughout the Internet.  I'm not sure how this is
   done or if it involves sneaking into theater previews, though.


Tony Hill:  I wonder if I'm one of the "Internet spies" the ep made fun of.  I
   attended producer David Silverman's presentation where he showed part of an
   upcoming ep, and I described it in ATS the next day.


>> Don't quit your day job

Evan Ross:  The two agents who where pointed out at the screening were said to
   have made Shaq a star.  Shaquille O'Neal is a basketball player who has
   basically never made a quality film.  Such of his films are "Steel",
   "Kazaam", and some others which weren't even _that_ worthwhile.  None of
   them have been any more than box-office duds.  I think he stopped making
   them.


Joe Klemm adds:  Shaquille O' Neal, though a good basketball player, is awful
   when it comes to acting.  The best proof of this was his portrayal of the
   comic book superhero Steel.  The film that is referred here, "Kazaam,"
   features Shaq as a genie who grants three wishes to a pre-teen boy.


>> Makes you wonder about the director's cut of "Showgirls"

Tom Rinschler:  The "director's cut" of a movie is usually released on video
   and usually contains scenes that are too violent or risqué to be shown in
   theaters. Of course, the director's cut of "Booty Call" must have lots of
   violence, because it could hardly be much raunchier.


>> Leonardo DiCaprio in CASABLANCA?  Are You Insane?

Jeff Cross explains Hollywood's remake-mania:  From time to time Hollywood
   feels it's necessary to redo a classic film with current actors and better
   production budgets.  Some examples include "Cruel Intentions" (a 1990s
   teenager "Dangerous Liaisons"), "Independence Day" (a more modern "War Of
   The Worlds"), and the Vincent Vaughn "Psycho," which tried to stay true to
   the original by using the same script, camera angles, and production
   schedule.

   [Less-celebrated movies also get this treatment.  "The Thomas Crowne
   Affair" was recently redone with Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan.  Mel
   Gibson's own "Payback" was also done (with a different title, but based on
   the same book) in the 60's -- Ed.]


>> He may be "People's" Sexiest Man Alive, but can he stop a nuclear meltdown?

Benjamin Robinson:  If you've never heard of Mel Gibson before, then welcome
   to our planet!  Gibson is an Australian actor who got his start in the
   States when "The Road Warrior," the second of the "Mad Max" movies, became
   a sleeper hit here.  The film established him as an action star, and he
   went on to make many others in that genre, such as the "Lethal Weapon"
   series and film noir-ish "Payback."

   There's more to Gibson than shooting and clever wisecracks, though, and he
   has stretched into different roles in some of his recent films.  Most
   notable of these was "Braveheart," a film that netted him Oscars for best
   picture and best director.  He even starred in the title role of "Hamlet,"
   the quintessential serious actors' role.

   By the way, Gibson had a (not entirely true) reputation for showing his
   rump in each of his films.  The scene where Homer and he moon the studio
   execs was probably as much a comment on this as a parody of "Braveheart."


>> Pretty good stuff, huh?  Huh?  Huh?

Jack Burns (who played Edward Christian in this episode) is one-half of the
   Burns and Schreiber comedy team.  Bill Le May tells us more about their
   careers:  Burns and Schreiber were a comedy team in the 60's and 70's.
   They did a lot of different bits, as well as improv.  A recurring schtick
   for them was a taxi driver (Avery Schreiber) picking up a gabby fare (Jack
   Burns).  Burns would talk his ear off and at several points get into the
   "Huh? - Yeah." loop, almost along the lines of "Nudge-nudge" by the Python
   crew.

   Burns showed up later in "Andy of Mayberry" as bumbling deputy Warren
   Ferguson.  Burns and Schreiber also had their own variety show in 1973.
   The Internet Movie Database confirms that you heard Jack on "Wait Till Your
   Father Gets Home".  It also shows both of them providing voices on
   Animaniacs.


Millard Isobar adds:  Burns was also the announcer/MC of "Fridays", which was
   ABC's short-lived version of "Saturday Night Live".


>> The fifty-cent tour

About some of the spots seen on Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie's tour of
   Hollywood.


Tom Rinschler:  The most infamous spot associated with Hugh Grant wouldn't be
   the place where he filmed "Nine Months", but where he was caught soliciting
   a prostitute.


Tony Hill:  The Hollywood Brown Derby is long gone -- it wasn't shaped like a
   derby -- but the original Brown Derby -- which was -- is still partially
   standing. The owners tore part of it down in the middle of the night in
   1981 to evade preservationists, and it's been incorporated into a strip
   mall.


>> Celebrate Our Homosexuality Or Else!

Jeff Cross:  The romance between Anne Heche and Ellen Degeneres has been
   shoved into everybody's face ever since they came out.  Ever since then, it
   feels like they've been daring anybody to downgrade their relationship so
   they can scream homophobe.  The media also acts like they're pioneers in
   this regard, despite the fact that Sandra Bernhard and Amanda Bearse had
   been out long before and have played lesbian characters on "Roseanne" and
   "Married With Children" respectively.


>> "But we already bought five Golden Globes!"

There's a story behind this joke, and Joe Klemm tells it:  Back in the 1980's
   and early 1990's, the Golden Globe Awards were considered a joke to many
   film-makers.  The reason: in 1982, the award for Best Female Newcomer went
   to Pia Zadora for "Butterfly," which was considered an awful film. However,
   the real reason why she won it was because her husband bribed the Hollywood
   Foreign Press voters into voting her as Best Female Newcomer.  A similar
   example took place it 1993, when "Scent of a Woman," though an okay film,
   ended up winning Best Drama Film against "Unforgiven."


>> "Saving Irene Ryan"

David Brunt:  Irene Ryan (real name Irene Noblette) died on 26 April 1973, 18
   months after "The Beverly Hillbillies" finished.  She was 68 at the time of
   her death, but made-up to appear even older for the show.  Originally a
   dancer, she appeared in many movies, primarily westerns due to her southern
   accent. She made brief appearances in the original version of "Mighty Joe
   Young" and "My Darling Clementine."


Tony Hill adds:  Irene Ryan [...]  played the grandmother on the "Beverly
   Hillbillies."  She became an actress at middle age, and she joined the cast
   of the "Bonzo" movies only after Ronald Reagan stopped playing in them.


>> And the Oscar for most "Car Watch" references goes to ...

... this episode, according to Benjamin Robinson:  The Elect-Taurus is a clone
   of GM's Impact, an electric car available in limited release.

   As Mr. Gibson is nice enough to say, the minivan he's driving is a Dodge
   Caravan.  It's pretty hard to confuse this with the Toyota Previa, which
   looks kind of egg-like in comparison to the Caravan.

   At the museum, we see the Munster-mobile, the Monkeemobile, and Batmobile
   (all George Barris [?] creations; Barris was the king of the late-60s
   customizers), Herbie the Love Bug, and one of the makeshift vehicles from
   "The Road Warrior."

   [{jg} spotted the Flintstones' car.  {er} was the first to spot the
   Munster-mobile and the Batmobile.  Furthermore, he noticed the General Lee,
   a 1969 Dodge Charger from "Dukes of Hazzard," was also there -- Ed.]

   The executives chase Mel and Homer in a Mercedes Benz, either a C-class or
   the previous-generation E-class.


Don Del Grande adds:  Homer and Mel make their getaway in "The Road Warrior
   Car" -- but the second "Mad Max" movie isn't called "The Road Warrior" in
   some other countries, including Australia.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Mad Max Power


Andrew Levine's alterna-alternate title:  Homervan's Travels


Tony Hill:  Jack Valenti is the head of the MPAA but doesn't fit the way Homer
   described him.  His claim to fame before that was working in the White
   House for President Lyndon Johnson.


Noah Levine:  Did anyone notice the scene of Mel shooting on the floor while
   turning resembles Homer when happy that the Union strike is over with Mr.
   Burns?"


Al Denton responds:  He resembled something Homer would do because homer co-
   wrote the ending.


Tom Rinschler:  The first two "Godfather" films were critically acclaimed
   hits.  The third was a critically-bashed bomb.  Hence its mention as a film
   not to be emulated.


Benjamin Robinson:  Homer's "whatever year this is" isn't just a joke, but a
   practical way to keep from "dating" the show in syndication.  After all,
   doesn't it sound weird when some character on an old sitcom says, "Hey get
   with the times!  It's the 70s."

Marge:      Um, will you be reading the cards yourself, Mel?
Gibson:     Well, I'll be reading yours personally.  [kisses her on the
            hand, and growls playfully.  Marge giggles and almost
            hyperventilates.]
Homer:      [pushes his way to the front of the crowd]  That's it!  I'm
            telling Mr. Stupidest Man Alive what I really thought of
            his movie.  Hey, Gibson!
Gibson:     Uh, yes, sir.
Homer:      You got a pencil?
Gibson:     Here you go.
Homer:      [grabs pencil]  Thanks.  [mutters]  Waste my time in front
            of his stupid ... [hands pencil back] Appreciate it!

-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% On the flight home, Christian, Milo, Hannah, and Gibson go over the
% opinion cards.  They're all rave reviews.  All, that is, but one.

Gibson:        [reading from card]  Your movie is more boring than
               church.  All you did was yak, yak, yak.  You didn't even
               shoot anybody -- Damn!  I knew it!
Christian:     Aw, don't do this to yourself, Mel.  The guy's obviously
               a nut.
Gibson:        Maybe.  Maybe he's the only person with the guts to tell
               me the truth.
-- Nah, I'd go with that first answer, "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Gibson goes to the cockpit, and tells John Travolta to divert to 742
% Evergreen Terrace.  Travolta is kind of ticked, since Gibson did help
% him to move, but turns the plane around.

% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:34]
%
% At the Simpson home, a plane roars overhead, passing so close that
% the sounds jostles Maggie around on the couch.  It subsides, and then
% the doorbell rings.  Marge opens it, and is surprised to see Mel
% Gibson.

Gibson:        I'm looking for [reads card] Homer Simpson.
Homer:         And I've been looking for you too, pal.
Bart:          Pound him, dad!
Lisa:          Bart, don't!
Bart:          Quiet!  Dad's going to get his butt kicked by Mel
               Gibson.  Knock his teeth out, Homer!
Homer:         Listen, Gibson.  I'm tired of Hollywood pretty-boys like
               you and Jack Valente thinking you can have any woman you
               want.  You see this?  [holds up Marge's hand, to permit
               close inspection of Marge's wedding ring]  It symbolizes
               that she's my property, and I own her.
Gibson:        Mr. Simpson, I need your help.
Homer:         Duh?
Gibson:        I think you're right about my movie, and I want you to
               help me make it better.
Homer:         Really?  You want my help?  Marge, did you hear that?
               Mel Gibson wants my help.  Mel Gibson!
Lisa:          Dad, I thought you hated ...
Homer:         [interrupting] Shut up.
Marge:         Homer doesn't know anything about making movies.
Gibson:        Don't sell your husband short, Mrs. Simpson.
Homer:         She's always doing that, Mel.
Marge:         Mmmm.
Gibson:        Homer is a brutally honest man.  Completely tactless and
               insensitive.
Homer:         Hee, hee.  Guilty as charged.
Gibson:        The problem I have is people love me so much, they never
               criticize me.  I speed all the time but the cops never
               give me a ticket.  If I don't pay my taxes, the IRS pays
               them for me.
Marge:         [sympathetic] Oh, you poor thing.
Gibson:        It's hell being Mel.
               [outside, the plane honks]
Travolta:      C'mon, geez!
Gibson:        I don't have much time, Homer.  Will you come to
               Hollywood with me?
Homer:         You had me at, "hello."
Gibson:        I didn't say, "hello."
-- Hello?  "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Soon the family is winging its way to Tinseltown.

Marge:    Hollywood, here we come!
          [the plane lands in L. A.]
          Hollywood, here we are!
Lisa:     Stop doing that, mom.
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Gibson personally drives the Simpsons to Polystar Pictures.  Homer is
% thoroughly impressed with Gibson's wheels:  A Dodge Caravan, the
% Cadillac of minivans.  (No, wait.  That was the Oldsmobile Silhouette.
% Never mind.)

Marge:    Look, they're making a movie!  Robert Downey, Jr. is shooting
          it out with the police.
          [cut to see a squadron of cops shooting it out with Downey]
Bart:     I don't see any cameras.
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Homer gives Marge and the kids some money, and tells them to go see
% the sights while he and Gibson work on the movie.  Bart wants to come
% watch, but Homer says there's too much work to do.  ("Mel's movie
% really stinks," he says in a whisper loud enough for Gibson to hear.)
%
% Gibson doesn't think Homer's suggestions to improve the movie are
% much better.  Homer suggests upping the humor quotient by running
% several scenes in fast motion.  Nah.  A musical montage where Gibson
% wears funny hats would bring out Gibson's playful side, Homer
% suggests.  Nix to that, too.
%
% Meanwhile, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie take a bus tour of
% Hollywood.

Guide:    Uh, for those of you who always wanted to see the famous
          Brown Derby restaurant ...
Marge:    Ooh!
Guide:    ... that's where it used to be.  [indicated a vacant lot with
          several drifters milling about]
Marge:    [disappointed] Oh.
Guide:    And on your left is the notorious spot where Hugh Grant ...
Marge     Ew.
Guide:    ... filmed the movie, "Nine Months."
Marge:    Eww!
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Back in the notorious spot where Homer pitched movie improvement
% suggestions to Mel Gibson ...

Gibson:   You want me to replace the villain with a dog?  I mean nobody
          will know what's going on.
Homer:    They will if you set up that the dog is evil.  All you do is
          have to show him doing this.  [lowers eyelids and glances
          around in shifty-eyed fashion]
          The people will suspect the dog.
Gibson:   Maybe this wasn't a good idea, Homer.  I'm sorry I dragged
          you out here.  Let me pay your bus fare home.
Homer:    Uh, uh, uh.  Now here's your biggest problem of all.
Gibson:   The filibuster scene?  That was Jimmy Stewart's favorite.
Homer:    And it was fine for the 1930s; the country was doing great
          back then.  Everyone was into talking.  But now, in whatever
          year this is, the audience wants action.  And seats with
          beverage holders.  But mainly action.
Gibson:   You really think it's boring?
Homer:    Oh, Mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage I've ever
          seen.  And it's not easy for me to say that.
Gibson:   Hmm.  I guess it is a little flat.  Okay, let's reshoot the
          ending.  I'll call the hair and makeup ladies, and you see if
          the Teamsters will work for free.
Homer:    Piece of cake.  Now where's that kid with my latte?
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Marge and the kids have moved on to a walking tour.  Using a map, she
% points out the house belonging to the dog from "Frasier," which is
% across the street from where Ellen Degeneres and Anne Heche live.
%
% That next day, Mel and Homer prepare to show the new, improved "Mr.
% Smith Goes to Washington."  As it begins, Gibson, as Mr. Smith, is
% nearing the end of his filibuster speech.

Gibson:   Well, I'm not licked.  I'm going to stay here and fight for
          this lost cause.  Somebody will listen to me.  Somebody will
          ... [collapses on the floor[
Payne:    I believe the Senator has yielded the floor.
Gibson:   [wakes up]  Yield this, Senator Payne.
          [throws an American flag like a javelin, striking Payne.  He
          falls on his desk, the flagpole now standing upright]
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Gibson grabs two other senators and slams their heads inside two
% desks.

Gibson:   I move, we impose some serious term limits.
Homer:    [from the press gallery]  I second that motion.  [holds up a
          rifle]  With a vengeance!  [tosses rifle to Gibson]
-- Why didn't Jimmy Stewart think of this?  "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Catching the rifle, Gibson jumps up on a table and quips, "All in
% favor, say die."  Then, spinning around on a table like Curly, the
% guns down most of the senators.  The Senate leader complains that
% Gibson's actions are "highly unorthodox," and pounds a gavel.  Gibson
% throws a fire extinguisher under the gavel, and when the leader hits
% it, it explodes.  The explosion fills the building with smoke, and
% sends the statue on top of the Capitol Dome into the river.
%
% Just then, an aristocratic man storms in and identifies himself as
% the President of the United States.  He demands to know what all the
% commotion is about.  Gibson rips the National Seal down from the wall,
% and tosses it at the President, slicing off his head.  The head lands
% at Gibson's feet.  He picks it up and grimly says, "Happy birthday,
% Mr. President."  A crowd of happy schoolchildren bursts in and carries
% Gibson off, cheering.  Gibson takes his badge, and throws it into the
% dead Payne's hand.  Payne's hand clutches it, and then relaxes.  The
% lettering on the badge is changed to, "The End."
%
% The lights come up in the screening room.

Gibson:        Pretty cool, huh?
Christian:     You, uh, you chopped off the President's head.
Gibson:        Bet you didn't see that coming.
Hannah:        You impaled a United States Senator with the American
               flag.
Milo:          Why did Mr. Smith kill everybody?
Homer:         It was symbolism.  He was mad.
Christian:     But this was going to be the studio's prestige picture,
               like "Howard's End" or "Sophie's Choice."
Homer:         Ugh.  Those movies sucked.  I only saw them to get Marge
               into the sack.  [sotto voce]  P. S.:  Mission
               accomplished.  [high-fives Gibson]
Christian:     But we already bought five Golden Globe awards.
Gibson:        I don't make movies to win awards.  [holds up two Oscar
               statuettes; speaks in sotto voce]  Especially now that I
               have two Oscars.  [normal voice]  I make movies for guys
               like him.
Homer:         Yeah, guys like me.
Christian:     Who are you, anyway?
Homer:         Do the words Executive Producer mean anything to you?
Gibson:        Executive Producer?
Homer:         We'll talk.
Christian:     [takes film off the projector]  You desecrated a classic
               film.  This is worse than "Godfather III."
Gibson:        Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa!  Let's not say things we can't
               take back.
Christian:     All right, all right, I'm sorry.  But this film is never
               going to see the light of day.  [takes a lighter to the
               film, intending to set it aflame]
               [Gibson and Homer gasp]
Gibson:        [pointing out the window] Look -- they're towing away a
               Range Rover.
               [Christian, Milo, and Hannah run to the window to look]
Hannah:        There's no --
Gibson:        [grabbing film] Yoink!  C'mon Homer, we've got a movie
               to premiere.
Homer:         Woo hoo!  [Gibson and Homer beat a hasty retreat]
Christian:     We've got to get that film back or we're all going to
               get fired, you know what I mean?
Milo:          Yeah.
Christian:     Huh?
Milo:          Yeah.
Christian:     Huh?
Milo:          Yeah.
Christian:     Huh?
Milo:          Fired.
-- Another typical Hollywood screening, "Beyond Blunderdome"

% The executives give chase.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  14:49]
%
% The motor chase leads through the filming of the new McBain film,
% "Saving Irene Ryan."

Ryan:     [slung over McBain's shoulder] You put me down, you big
          lummox!  Jed!
McBain:   Shut up, old lady!  And stop kicking me there!
-- Coming soon to a theater near you, "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Gibson and Homer are forced to abandon their vehicle when they run
% into land mines, however.  They take refuge in a building.  The
% executives' car pulls into view.

Homer:    Aw, crap!  Here they come.
Gibson:   Well that's it, Homer.  We should have known better than to
          match wits with studio executives.
-- They're a pretty smart bunch, "Beyond Blunderdome"

% It turns out that Homer and Gibson are hiding out in a museum of
% Hollywood memorabilia.  In one of those movie-like coincidences, it is
% the same museum that Marge and the kids are touring.  Bart admires the
% surprisingly lifelike dummies of Batman and Robin sitting in the
% original Batmobile.

Bart:     Wow, these dummies look pretty good.
Batman:   Well, I've had a lot of surgery, old chum.
Robin:    Shh.  Mr. Amato's going to fire us if you don't stop
          bothering the customers.
          [Homer and Gibson run up]
Marge:    Homer, what are you doing here?
Homer:    No time talk -- need steal car.  Must save powerful but
          controversial picture.
          [looks around furtively, until he sees one of the "Mad Max"
          cars]
          Quick, Mel, get in!
Gibson:   [sighs] Forget it, Homer.  Let's just give them the stupid
          movie.
Homer:    Movies aren't stupid.  They fill us with romance and hatred
          and revenge fantasies.  "Lethal Weapon" showed us that
          suicide is funny.
Gibson:   That really wasn't my intention.
Homer:    Before "Lethal Weapon 2" I didn't know there could be a bomb
          in my toilet, but now I check every time.
Marge:    It's true, he does.
Gibson:   Do movies mean that much to you, Homer?
Homer:    They're my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
          [to family]  No offense.
Gibson:   Aw, what the heck.  Let's hit the road.  Shove over, junior.
          [pushes aside Mad Max dummy sitting in the "Mad Max" car]
          [starts the car and barrels through the wall of the museum]
Batman:   That thoughtless destruction will surely bankrupt the museum,
          old chum.
Robin:    Shut up.
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% The executives close in.  Gibson tells Lisa -- and he is insistent
% that it is Lisa -- to take the wheel.  The next thing we see is Gibson
% leap off the car.  He bounces off the executives' car and lands on the
% pavement, where several more cars run over him.
%
% Christian, who was driving, immediately concocts an alibi.  ("You all
% saw it -- he came at me with a knife, right?")  The excuse isn't
% needed, for the "body" that was run over was just the dummy Mel from
% the museum.  The execs resume the chase.
%
% Homer abruptly stops the "Mad Max" car, and announces that it's time
% they made a stand.  We switch back to the executives' point of view as
% they drive down the street to see ... Gibson and Homer mooning them.

Milo:     Who the heck is that?
Hannah:   Well, the one on the left is Mel Gibson.  I don't know who
          the other two guys are.
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% Gibson is having second thoughts about this strategy.

Gibson:   Will you please tell me the rest of the plan?
Homer:    It was your plan, from "Braveheart."  Your army mooned the
          enemy until they could take no more and surrendered.
Gibson:   No!  They didn't!  They attacked us in a horribly bloody
          battle.  Remember?
Homer:    Actually, I didn't see it, but on the poster it --
Gibson:   [interrupting] Jump!
          [Gibson leaps out of the way, but Homer is struck square in
          the rump]
          Homer, are you okay?
Homer:    I think so.  [walks a few steps, dragging the car along with
          him]  No.
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% The executives have apparently relented, because the movie -- revised
% ending and all -- is released to the public.  The reaction confirms
% the studio's worst fears.  Not only did the audience hate it, but
% Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter threatens to sue.  Homer regrets not
% including the shifty-eyed dog.
%
% Outside the theater, Gibson and Homer try to recover from the
% evening's debacle.

Homer:    Aw, I'm sorry I ruined your career, Mel.
Gibson:   It's not your fault, Homer.  I guess there's no room in
          today's crazy, gentle America for violent dinosaurs like us.
Homer:    How did the country lose its way, Mel?  When did we stop
          rooting for the man with a flame-thrower or an acid-spraying
          gun of some kind?
Gibson:   I blame the internet.  And the return of swing music.
Homer:    Well, whatever it is, we gotta get rolling on our next
          picture.  Hey, what about a prequel of something?  Everybody
          loves prequels.
Gibson:   I don't.
Homer:    [exasperated sigh] Okay, Mr. Difficult.  How about a teen sex
          romp, where you and your buddies are always trying to get
          some.  No, wait!  A ghost who wins the lottery.  [Mel and
          Homer get into a waiting limousine]  You can be the ghost, or
          the lottery commissioner.
          [the limo drives off]
          Ooh!  What about Indiana Jones?  Does anyone own the rights
          to that?
          [the limo door opens, and Homer is tossed onto the street]
          Hey Mel!  I fell out!
-- "Beyond Blunderdome"

% The camera pans back to the theater.  A lone dog with an evil, shifty-
% eyed, expression sits in front of the building.  Hmmm ... perhaps this
% was his doing all along.  The screen fades to black, and we hear a
% howl.
%
% The End, at least until the sequel.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time:  20:28]
%
% The closing sound bite is Gibson's Curly-like, "Woo woo woo!"
