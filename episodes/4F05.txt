> "TV Guide" Synopsis  {jmb}
==============================================================================
   Rodney Dangerfield is the voice of Mr. Burns' unrefined, illegitimate
   son, Larry, who's a hit with Homer but who gets "no regard, no regard
   at all" from his father. But Homer has a plan.

==============================================================================
> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Couch      :- Five clear, blue balloons, shaped like each member of the
              family, float down onto the couch. They take place -- with
              a little squeaking -- and then pop.

==============================================================================
> Did you notice...
==============================================================================
   ... this is the first episode written by Ian Maxtone-Graham?
   ... the episode starts in Mt. _Swartzwelder_?
   ... Burns is a Yale 1914 grad?
   ... the sweat marks under Larry's jacket when he meets Burns?
   ... Larry walks just like Burns (with arms out and fingers pointing
       down)?
   ... Homer was making a 64-piece jigsaw puzzle of Snoopy asleep on his
       doghouse?
   ... Homer's Santa suit and Xtapalopaqetl in the basement?
   ... the Krusty costume in the shop's window?

James R. Curry:
   ... the way Larry positions the "Gone Drinkin'" sign shows he knows
       about Burns' hidden camera?

Don Del Grande:
   ... the trees at the orchard are turning brown, but the ones in New
       Haven are green?
   ... each tree's leaves are all the same color?
   ... the first time Homer arrives home, Grampa is still in the car?
   ... Burns went to a "Uniplex" (a one-screen movie theater)?
   ... Homer says he has "unconditional love" for his kids, something he
       seemed to lack when Lisa ruined his barbecue?

Jason Hancock:
   ... the tour guide is named Randy?
   ... Larry wears a blue SNPP ID badge?
   ... Homer holds a fork with only three prongs (instead of four)?
   ... Groundskeeper Willy is in the crowd?  (Apparently his Proposition
       24-related deportation [3F20] was short-lived.)

Eric Hartman:
   ... Homer still has the turkey leg after dinner?
   ... all of the Flanders, Marge and Maggie wear apple hats?

Ryan Johnson:
   ... there is a river around SNPP?
   ... Homer's sector is off until he notices Larry?
   ... Larry has an ID tag but Homer doesn't?

Ricardo Lafaurie:
   ... Larry Burns looks and acts incredibly like Rodney Dangerfield?
   ... Larry's business is out in the middle of a set of train tracks?
   ... the giant gate at Burns Manor is OPEN?
   ... Burns doesn't threaten Larry with the hounds?
   ... Marge's idea is judged to be "idiocy"?

Lawrence Lam:
   ... Burns went to the movies at New Haven Uptown Uniplex?
   ... Lionel Hutz has blue hair at the end? Or there is a bluehaired
       Lionel Hutz lookalike?
   ... the Pawn Shop is next to the theatre?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... besides OFF and the Flanderses, only old people are at the mill?
   ... Flanders seems to look like he's put on weight?
   ... Flanders is the first (and probably only) one to have a season
       pass at the cider mill?
   ... Smithers gets drunk really quickly? (or perhaps he's just
       humoring Mr. Burns)
   ... it seems lately OFF has had very boring activities? (i.e., visit
       to the Bonanza mall reunion)
   ... Mr. Burns has a room for someone he wasn't even expecting?
   ... the shadow the absent couch has left behind in the TV room?
   ... Chief Wiggum is the first TV person to notice that 555 is a phony
       number?
   ... Maggie knows Homer calls her stinky?

Joe Manfre:
   ... Chief Wiggum's badge is on the left (i.e. correct) side?
   ... the distinct "Amtrak" styling of the train?

David Ney:
   ... the Duff Beer commercial on TV?
   ... the music in "Too Many Grandmas" is the same music from "Good
       Time Slim, Uncle Doobie, and the Great Frisco Freak Out"?

       Burns when the train screeches to a halt?
   ... none of the bar glasses or bottles fall over when the train
       stops?
   ... all the billiard balls go into the same pocket instead of being
       scattered at the one end of the table?

Mark Aaron Richey:
   ... the episode doesn't take place in 1996 (since there wasn't a
       World Series 7th game)?
   ... Burns's old roommate is still alive (making him in the 100+
       range, too)?
   ... Smithers has his ID card on at Burns's?
   ... the picture of Angus Burns over the mantle?
   ... the country club is not the club from 3F11?
   ... Burns's slamming the door blows out the candles on the table?
   ... Bart cluches his shirt, like Larry/Rodney Dangerfield cluches his
       tie, while insulting Marge?
   ... Burns is the only one not dancing in the first longshot outside
       the theater (though he does in the second)?
   ... the regular full closing theme has yet to play this season (not
       even in the reruns)?

Benjamin Jay Robinson:
   ... Ian Maxtone-Graham is both the writer and consulting producer of
       this episode?
       (How cushy is that?  "Ian, I think this joke is kind of lame."
       "Really?  I ran it by the consulting producer and he loved it."
       "Oh, okay, then.")
   ... Bart (and maybe Maggie) is the only one not grossed out by the
       rats?

Ana Robles:
   ... The streched out pepsi bottle has some sort of blue fluid in it?
   ... When Larry recounts the events of his life, he neglects to
       mention that he aparently had a wife and kids?
   ... Bart doesn't mention that Burns ran over him with a car?
   ... When ordering the Yale guys out of his office, Burns holds his
       pen up threateningly like a knife?

Liam J. Scanlan:
   ... Larry is from Waynesport, Connecticut?
   ... Burns came from New Haven, Connecticut?
   ... Larry calls Smithers "Chuckles"?
   ... Mr. Burns is a grandfather?

Mike Schiraldi:
   ... there is a Princeton pennant (orange and black) in the background
       of Moe's?

=  Larry's watch disappears.  (This could be counted as a goof since he
   didn't seem to exactly need to use the watch).  {ol}

*  World Series games are always played at night (even though it's late
   afternoon when they start on the west coast, so maybe it's not).
   {mar}

+  Marge knows how to pronounce "Nuclear" in 9F16.  ("You're a nuclear
   technician?")  {ddg}

*  It takes a train a little while to make a complete stop.  I assume
   the couch probably would've simply caused a very messy accident.
   {ol}

=  Smithers does not have a pool cue in hand when the train halts, then
   has one a second later after they see the balls go into the pocket.
   {dp2}

*  Smithers congratulates Burns for sinking all the pool balls in one
   pocket after the train stops; however, as Don Del Grande pointed out
   in the 2F09 capsule, this is a foul.  {jm}

c  The closed-captions have Smithers saying "Oh!  Where did that lamp
   come from?" when he's drunk, but nothing is heard.  {jh}

+  Marge has pronounced "nuclear" and "library" correctly in the past.
   {dga}

c  Also did you notice the way she pronounced "escape" as "exscape" but
   it was spelled correctly in the captioning.  {mc}

=  We don't see OFF's car pull into the driveway, but we see it pulling
   out.  (And we know their driveway isn't THAT long.)  {jh}

+  In 1F21, Jackie Bouvier was never Grampa's fiancee.  {ol}

   [Tara Seeley comments: "Yeah, but Grandpa can't be expected to
   remember this... he is Grampa after all..."]

+  "Burns Manor" doesn't appear to exist on Mr. Burns' gate anymore.
   {ol}

+  If Burns knew he had a son, why didn't he make him his heir in 1F16?
   {rl}

+  In "Simpson and Delilah", Burns was supposed to be as "bald as a
   plucked chicken" in his senior years at university.  At the reunion,
   he still has (what looks like) his natural hair.  {rb}

*  "Gone With the Wind" was released in 1939, but not until December, to
   qualify for the Oscars.  It didn't go into wide release (including,
   I'm assuming, New Haven, CN) until 1940.  {mar}

+  Burns said he has "never experienced the gentle sex" in 7G10.  {rl}

=  The jigsaw puzzle wasn't on the control panel when Homer was
   sleeping.  {ol}

-  The only corner missing from the jigsaw puzzle was the bottom right,
   which should be green, but the "loose" corner piece was pink - and
   the shape wouldn't let it fit.  {ddg}

+  The "demotivational sign" and pictures of Maggie are gone from
   Homer's work area.  {ddg}

+  Lisa, once again, appears to have meat on her plate (so much for the
   promise to the McCartneys).  {mar}

*  What is "the Admiral" an admiral in?  Dress blue uniforms in the US
   Navy and Coast Guard have ranks designated at the ends of the
   sleeves, but admirals have a 4" gold band, something this guy was
   missing.  {ddg}

-  You can't see into Larry's "glass" mug at Moe's.  {ddg}

=  Some of the food Homer takes from the dinner scene disappears.  {jh}

-  Larry's umbrella drink loses it's pink color for three frames while
   walking with Homer.  {dp2}

*  In Pai Gow Poker, the object is to make a five-card Poker hand and a
   two-card hand from seven cards that are both better than the house's
   hands (it's a "players against the house" game, like Blackjack), but
   Lisa shouldn't be happy that she has a Pai Gow, since it's a hand
   with no possible pairs.  {ddg}

=  The TV screen is blank when Marge orders Homer to take Larry back,
   even though Marge doesn't turn it off.  {jh}

*  Kent Brockman travels from Burns Manor to OFF's house in a few
   seconds.  {ljs}

=  The walkway in the auditorium wasn't sticky when Homer and Larry went
   into it.  {ol}

=  The seat behind Homer and Larry was unoccupied when they first
   entered the movie auditorium.  {ol}

=  When ordering Wiggum to shoot Larry, Mr. Burns was standing next to
   Wiggum's squad car. A few seconds later, he's in front of a
   fire truck.  {ol}

-  Standing next to the Van Houtens in the party scene at the end is
   someone who looks a whole lot like Lionel Hutz but with blue hair.
   Was this supposed to be Hutz?  {jm}

=  The fire truck is in front of the theater throughout the final scene,
   but at the end it's at the left.  {ljs}

-  The (C) is still missing from the copyright screen.  {ljs}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Yet another fine episode with a fine guest voice.
   Though the plot wasn't the strongest in the world, the quality and
   quantity of the gags kept me laughing consistently throughout the
   episode.  Ian Maxtone- Graham, in his first effort, proves himself
   worthy to join the ranks of Simpsons writers.  (A-)

Brad Barth:  Rodney Dangerfield with a supporting role would have been
   okay; him as the star wasn't. He and his brand of one-liner humor,
   which doesn't mix well with "Simpson" humor, almost completely take
   over this flat episode. Any amusing gags, like Homer's brain
   abandoning its body, and Grampa sitting on a pie, were overshadowed
   by Larry Burns' Dangerfield-esque character and irritating insult
   jokes. It was proper that Burns didn't bend in the end and accept his
   son; he's still a heartless old man. But, then again, I hope not to
   see much of  Mr. Burns' son in the future either.  (C-)

Jennifer M. Blaske:  While watching this, I couldn't quite decide
   whether I was enjoying it or not. I think it had to do with Rodney
   Dangerfield - he was funny, but too much like Himself. Also, the plot
   itself seemed a little stale, although I agree they did a nice job
   handling Mr. Burns' reaction. There were some pretty funny parts,
   however, including Homer's brain leaving, Marge's mispronunciations,
   etc.  (B)

Steve Frayne:  Losing only to "Two Bad Neighbors", this is the worst
   episode in the last 6 seasons.  I found it hard to sit through a
   second time because Larry just wasn't funny.  His cutdowns give a
   very brief chuckle, but there isn't a single line that sticks out as
   notably funny afterward. Include that with a poor plot and
   significantly less Homer humor than usual and you'll get a deadly
   combination which earns this episode an  (F)!

Jason Hancock:  Hmmm... I thought the story was a little shaky at times
   and the ending, like last week, was forced.  But this one had the
   funniest moment of the season for me (Hans Moleman in the movie
   theater), and the laughs in this one were good enough to eke out a
   (B+)

Ryan Johnson:  A fair episode, nothing exceptional.  I only laughed a
   few times and the ending seemed out of place and kind of ruined the
   episode. I'm still waiting for an episode about the rest of the
   family. 3F23 had a few bits, but everything so far has been about
   Homer.  (C+)

Ricardo Lafaurie:  Something wasn't right.  Granted, Rodney Dangerfield
   did a good job with the voice of Larry Burns, but the way he was
   acting, it was like Rodney Danger-field actually _was_ the son of Mr.
   Burns.  It felt very fragmented, too; a lot of funny jokes held
   together by some very weak glue.  The party scene at the end added
   nothing except a song to add to my music list. Generally, the show
   was funny -- but funny isn't everything.  We need something that
   makes sense for it to be ha-ha funny.  (C)

Joe Manfre:  Seemingly an unhealthy premise, mixing the one-liner style
   of Dangerfield's comedy with the historically plot-driven comedy of
   OFF. Still, they came off with a fairly tight story and some clever
   little jokes (Marge's consistent mispronunciations, etc.), although
   the "trip to the apple-cider farm" at the beginning seemed tacked-on.
   (B)

Blaine Moller:  The first actually funny episode of this season!  I
   liked the trip to the orchard.  Alot of good gags in this one;
   homer's brain, picking up hitchhiker when they reach the driveway
   etc... Classic homer stupidity, especially homer's line "what are you
   going to do, call the cops" (duh). A really good episode (finally).
   (B+)

David Ney:  Kind of a silly episode.  It was nice to see Homer caring
   about the well being of a "drifter" again.  Rodney Dangerfield's
   jokes were funny, and the part about Homer's fake bloody death on the
   news was hilarious!  I'm also a sucker for Disco Stu and Handsomr
   Pete.  It was nice to see them in another episode.  (A-)

Keith Palmer:  The well isn't quite dry yet when it comes to long-lost
   relatives.  While Larry Burns was a little too Rodney Dangerfield to
   make him a truly memorable character, Mr. Burns was nicely
   characterized as the father who realises that he can only love
   someone like himself.  (B+)

Damian Penny:  This episode seemed to be just an excuse on which to hang
   lots of Dangerfield one-liners, at the expense of the plot.  Worse,
   they're Dangerfield one-liners which we've all heard many times
   before. Still, there were some very funny bits (especially Barney's
   scene) and the makers deserve credit for bringing back Disco Stu and
   Handome Pete for the bizarre finale.  (B-)

Mark Aaron Richey:  A very funny episode, even if it did turn into a
   vehicle for Rodney Dangerfield (the first episode, I think, where a
   guest star so dominated the episode).  Probably the best episode of
   the season (so far), but it did suffer from the annoying "nice Burns"
   syndrome, even though there was a reason for it, and he (sort-of)
   returned to himself by the end.  (B+)

Matt Rose:  Overall, I can't say I liked it as much as last week but it
   was decent. I thought the first two acts held up but the way the plot
   was solved was a little disappointing. Since "Caddyshack" is my
   favorite movie of all time I was delighted to see some references to
   it. I still think they aren't throwing in quite as many jokes as I'd
   like to see, though. And Bart and Lisa still need more lines.  (B)

Liam J. Scanlan:  "Burns, Baby Burns" was better than "The Homer They
   Fall" and that was hard to beat. Rodney Dangerfield was brilliant and
   Ian Maxtone-Graham's first episode is the best there is, the best
   there was and the best there ever will be. The best ending I ever
   saw.  (A+)

Vishal Sharma:  Burns Baby Burns is annoyingly uneven. To begin with it
   promised to be a good episode (with a possible subplot), but after
   the first act is seemed to dwindle into a bad episode (without a good
   subplot). I'd given up all hope on the episode redeeming itself, but
   somehow it managed to still put a smile on my face during the final
   act. The "Ransom" homage was slick and the jokes towards the end were
   quite funny ("stupid economic recovery!"). However, special guest
   Rodney Dangerfield was this episode's biggest miss-fire. Larry Burns
   was so underdeveloped, but some of his one-liners were pretty good.
   It's a shame, this episode had great potential - and to a certain
   extent it showed it - but overall it's still not up to the standard
   we expect from OFF.  (C)

Ryan Siebel:  IMHO, "Burns, Baby Burns" was inferior to "The Homer They
   Fall" not just because of the forced appearance of Rodney
   Dangerfield, but the fact that the first and second act were very
   slow.  The apple cider mill visit took more time and produced less
   laughs than you would expect. And the whole "see Larry act like
   Rodney Dangerfield" idea seemed too predictable.  But the third act
   was terrific.  "Too Many Grandmas"!  And the party was terrific.
   First two acts: C-  Last Act: A-  (C+)

Yours Truly: A rather nice episode, with many clever jokes and funny
   moments. However, the abundance of recurring gags, threads and
   characters was somewhat over-whelming, making me wonder if I was
   watching a new episode or a clip show. Nevertheless, I enjoyed
   Larry's lack of tact, although I'm not sure if it was worth a whole
   episode, especially when I find it harder and harder to care for
   long-lost relatives. This sums up to something less than a great
   episode, but still fun to watch.  (B)


AVERAGE GRADE:  B- (2.77)

NIELSON RATING:  7.7  (ranked 65th out of 113)  {ol}

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> The Dangers of Rodney

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Rodney Dangerfield has been a big name in comedy
   for a long time, starting from the time that the earth's surface
   cooled.  Dangerfield's shtick  was playing the put-upon schmo who, in
   his words, "can't get no respect."  Larry Burns is a very
   Dangerfield-esque character, right down to the kind of zingers he
   tells and physical mannerisms.

Dale G. Abersold:  Rodney Dangerfield is a stand-up comedian made famous
   by his trademark line "I don't get no respect" (which the writers
   made fun of by using synonyms of "respect").  More recently
   Dangerfield has tried acting, in films as diverse as "Back to School"
   and "Natural Born Killers." Interestingly, he has been animated
   before... as "Rover Dangerfield."

Ondre Lombard:  Rodney Dangerfield's new movie "Meet Wally Sparks" is
   apparently a movie starring him as a crass man who mingles vulgarly
   with swanky, upper-crust people.  This similar situation occurs in
   4F05, in which Dangerfield as Larry Burns insults Carstairs, the chef
   and the debutante's mother.  Ironic how this happens before his movie
   opened.


>> Apples and World Series

Although funny by itself, Marge's comment about the World Series was
   ironically suited to this season's debut. After a whole summer
   without any rerun, FOX decided to set the season premiere's date
   right after the World Series, which they were broadcasting this year.
   (Many will recall FOX announcing 4F02 several weeks in advance: "The
   Simpsons -- after the World Series".)

   What brought so much turmoil on a.t.s. was that the possible Sunday
   for 4F02 fell on the *seventh* game. In other words, the outcome
   could be decided as late as the day before, if the Series lasted at
   least six games. And it did. That Saturday, many Simpsons fans who'd
   never watch baseball followed the game just to know when to set their
   VCRs. And Braves supporters, whose team was losing to the Yankees,
   were torn apart between their love for the Braves and their love for
   the Simpsons.

   To the joy of all -- especially Yankees fans -- there was no seventh
   game, and we were glued to our TV sets the next evening.  [Jason
   Hancock reminds us that the last Series to go seven games was the
   Minnesota-Atlanta matchup of 1991.]


>> Me Mispronounce Nucular? That's Unpossible!

Elson Trinidad:  It's a common pronounciation, but it's still
   technically incorrect. It's sort of like how most people can't write
   out contractions (i.e. words like "Won't" , "You're") correctly. Most
   Americans mis-pronounce "nuclear" because in everyday American
   English, it's rare for a word to contain a hard consonant followed by
   a soft consonant followed by a vowel. Worse yet, it was, of all
   people an American president (Jimmy Carter) who popularized the
   mispronounciation of "nuclear."

Len Freedman: "Nucular" is definitely wrong.  Nobody talks about the
   "nuculus" of an atom, do they?

   But in American English, grammar and usage is _descriptive_ not
   _prescriptive_.  We don't have a committee, like some countries do,
   that gets together every few years to decide what's a good new word
   and what's not allowed.  Instead, our lexicographers go around and
   listen to how people talk, and then they compile the dictionaries
   based on that.

   And there are lots of words in American that are so commonly
   mispronounced we don't notice.  Who says "comfortable"?  Instead we
   say "comfterble". "Ouija" should be pronunced "wee-ja" or "wee-ya",
   not "Wee-ji".  And everyone I know says "sherbert" for "sherbet".

Bob Beecher:  For another dose of the "word" NUCULAR, check out "SIMPSON
   TIDE" (4G02)!  Homer corrects a "nucular" sub captain (voice by Rod
   Steiger).


>> The boorish manners of a Yalie

Joshua Naftalis:  Dink's character refers to a Book called "Stover at
   Yale" by Owen Johnson.  Dink Stover is the main character of the book
   and it is set at exactly the same time the Burns was supposed to be
   at Yale.  The book was published in 1912.  The book chronicles Dink's
   life at Yale as a star on the football team and his efforts to make
   it into Skull and Bones.  Dink Stover came to represent the "Yale
   Man" because he was succesful, good-looking, and athletic, as well as
   a result of a fine prep-school (Lawrenceville).  This book is about
   the pinnacle of Yale life and elitism.


>> Where was that Outtake?

Joe Manfre:  Interestingly, according to Dave Hall's "Where is
   Springfield?" document, a preliminary script for "Brother, Can You
   Spare Two Dimes?" (8F23) had a similar joke wherein Herb was at a
   train station asking for tickets to Springfield and a train whistle
   drowned out the name of the state.  In this episode, the guy on the
   train seemed to be yelling for quite a long time to tell a simple
   state name... maybe he was trying to call out a whole sentence (such
   as "It's just a state of mind," or "It's not just another state")...

   Anyway, is this a case of writers getting lazy again?   ;)

   [Personally, I think it sounded a little like "The state of Alabama".
   But of course, we could debate for hours on this...  --ed]


>> Old as the Burns

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Monty Burns was a member of Yale's class of 1914.
   Assuming that he graduated at the usual age of around 22, Mr. Burns
   would have been born in 1892.  That would confirm his age as 104 in
   1996, when this episode aired.  His son, conceived in 1939 (and born
   either that year, or 1940) would be about 57 now.

Don Del Grande: Then again, maybe he spent 8 years in second grade, like
   Lisa...


>> Gone to the Movies

Mark Richey:  Gone With the Wind was one of the greatest movies ever
   made. According to "Variety", when adjusted for inflation, GWTW is
   the highest grossing film of all time, with earnings over 1 billion
   worldwide (take that, "Independence Day"!).  It tells the story of
   the stormy relationship between Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara
   (Vivian Leigh) and Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) during and after the
   Civil War in Georgia.  At the end of the film, Rhett tells Scarlett
   (whom he was leaving...again) "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a
   damn", a very controversial line in 1939/40, though today, the movie
   is rated "G".


>> Alliteration 1, History 0

Benjamin J. Robinson:  The Merrimac was a famous fighting ship from the
   Civil War -- the South's first iron-clad battleship.  It fought the
   Monitor, the North's first iron-clad battleship, in 1862.

   Incidentally, while it was in the service of the Confederacy, the
   Merrimac was known by another name.  In "The Dictionary of
   Misinformation," Tom Burnam writes that the South had salvaged a
   Northern frigate called the Merrimac, placed iron armor on it, and
   renamed it the Virginia.  Thus, the battle was between the Virginia
   and the Monitor.  "The popular term for the battle," concluded
   Burnam, "is a triumph of alliteration over history."  You may use
   this fact to impress you history teacher.


>> Flight 827 to Yale Departing Now

Matt Burstein:  I believe that this comment by the admissions director
   was meant to be a satire on Yale's attitude about itself.  New Haven
   is a small city of about 130,000 people, and the center of a small
   metropolitan area with well less than a million people.  Add this to
   the fact that New Haven is less than two hours from JFK and Newark
   international airports and less than an hour from Bradley in Hartford
   (which has flights to Canada), and you have a city that most
   certainly does NOT need an international airport.  Tweed, the small
   airport just east of New Haven, serves the city's purposes fine. Thus
   the remark may be a shot at the (often correct) assumption that Yale
   has a superiority complex - even though the airport idea makes no
   sense, it would be in character for Yale officials to think that if
   they want it, it must be a good idea.  This may be a reference to the
   talk earlier this year about expanding Tweed to a major airport,
   which most Connecticut residents would probably agree is a waste of
   money.


>> Too Many Grandmas

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Olympia Dukakis is a respected performer, but not
   that big of a box- office draw.  Mostly, she plays a supporting,
   rather than starring, role.  Her most well known appearance would be
   in "Moonstruck."  And yes, she is related to Democratic Presidential
   nominee Michael Dukakis.

   Bo Derek is Hollywood's equivalent of a one-hit wonder.  She was in
   the movie "Ten," where she played the object of Dudley Moore's
   affections. She got a lot of press attention for the role, but
   couldn't parlay this early success into a long-term career.  One
   movie, the soft-porn "Bolero," was so bad that just the mention of
   the title would start Hollywood types laughing.  I think Ms. Derek
   has since renounced acting, and now lives on some kind of ranch with
   her spouse.

Dale G. Abersold:  Olympia Dukakis and Bo Derek are in another in a
   series of horrible movies shown at the Aztec theatre.  Who can forget
   "Honk If You're Horny" with Pauly Shore and Faye Dunaway [3F05] and
   the unnamed movie with Liza Minnelli and Mickey Rourke [9F03]?
   (Ah-ha!  The formula seems to be one once-respected Oscar-winning
   actress, costarring a never-respected vomit- inducing pop-culture
   figure!  So the next movie may well star Ellen Burstyn and Paul
   Hogan.  Another one might star Cher...all by herself!)


>> Jimmy Hollywood

Michael Maxwell:  The ending to this episode paralleled a fairly recent
   movie with Joe Pesci called "Jimmy Hollywood". The end of this movie
   has Pesci and his friend locked in an empty movie theater at night in
   a stand-off with the cops. Pesci's character even fantasizes about
   going down in a hail of police bullets, just like the "possible
   outcome" that showed in the Simpson's news report.  At the end of the
   movie, the two guys turn themselves in, just as Homer and Larry did.


>> Any Way You Want It

Here are the lyrics for this Journey song, courtesy of Joshua Bancroft:

          Any way you want it
          That's the way you need it
          Any way you want it
          
          She loves to laugh
          She loves to sing
          She does everything
          She loves to move
          She loves to groove
          She loves the lovin' things
          
          Ooh, all night, all night
          Oh, every night
          So hold tight, hold tight
          Ooh baby, hold tight
          
          Oh, she said
          "Any way you want it
          That's the way you need it
          Any way you want it"
          She said, "Any way you want it
          That's the way you need it
          Any way you want it"
          
          I was alone
          I never knew
          What good love could do
          Ooh, then we touched
          Then we sang
          About the lovin' things
          
          Ooh, all night, all night
          Oh, every night So hold tight, hold tight
          Ooh baby, hold tight
          
          Oh, she said
          "Any way you want it
          That's the way you need it
          Any way you want it"
          She said, "Any way you want it
          That's the way you need it
          Any way you want it"


>> Those Immortal Threads

   - Is Smithers Gay?

Haynes Lee:  When Burns asks Smithers to take off his belt, Smithers
   smiles and says "With pleasure sir".


>> Loose Ends

Matt Burstein:  Peabody Museum is indeed the actual name for Yale's
   natural history museum. I have no idea if there are or ever were
   Eskimos on display there.

Mark Aaron Richey:  I'm going out on a limb here, but I think when Larry
   says he's stepped on a peacock might be a reference to NBC, a
   competeing network to Fox that uses a peacock as it's logo.  In real
   life, of course, it's NBC that's stomping Fox.

James R. Curry:  Looking at the episode capsule, I spotted just one
   ommision from the SKY version - "Come on.  If this stuff is too nice
   for ya, I've got some crap!"

  Abe: He stole my fiancee.
Homer: He made fun of my weight.

% The family drops Larry off at the Burns Manor and drives off.  The
% gates are open and Larry lets himself in.

Ho, this guy's got more bread than a prison meat loaf.  He's rich, I
tell ya.  I never seen a place with a walk-in mailbox. [realizing] Hey,
who am I talking to?
-- Larry comments on Burns' mansion, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Larry rings the doorbell.  Smithers answers.

Smithers: [eyeing Larry]  Yes?
   Larry: [sweating]  Yeah, uh... Hi, my-my name is Larry.  I'm here to
          see Mr. Burns.
Smithers: Well, I hate to break it to you, Larry, but if Mr. Burns
          ever wants to see a stranger, he will observe him through a
          powerful telescope.
-- Hasn't lost the common touch, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Mr. Burns opens the door, asking Smithers what's going on.  He sees
% the visitor and scolds him for interrupting his Lime Rickey.  He takes
% a finishing sip of his drink and asks the man to state his business.

Larry: Well, uh... sheesh... uh... I'm a little nervous here. What I'm
       trying to say is, I'm...
Burns: You're what?  Selling light bulbs?  Worried about the whales?
       Keen on Jesus?  Out with it!
Larry: Well, Mr. Burns, I'm your son.
        [Burns is shocked]
Larry: Oh, and I stepped on one of your peacocks.  You got a paper
       towel?
-- "Burns, Baby Burns"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 6:22]
%
% Mr. Burns looks underneath Larry's toupee and sees three circles on
% his head just like the ones on his. This cannot lie.

Larry: Ah, Pop, don't get me wrong; it's great to be here.  But how's a
       guy like you wind up with a son like me?
Burns: Ah, Larry, my lad, I've gone over this story in my mind a
       million times.  It was 1941, the... No, '39...
-- Two million times wouldn't have hurt, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Burns flashes back to the outdoors of the 25th Yale reunion feast of
% his Class of 1914.  A much younger C.M. Burns sees his unrequited love
% of his college years, Mimsy Bancroft, a middle-aged woman staring back
% at Young Burns.  Young Burns becomes wide-eyed as the narration goes
% on. "Of course, by then, Mimsy had her share of wrinkles and a grey
% hair or two, but my adoring eye saw past those minor imperfections --
% to her 21-year-old daughter, Lily," a much younger, dainty blonde
% standing in a pink dress with her hand on her hip.

I took Lily to the local cinematorium, where our passions were inflamed
by Clark Gable's reckless use of the word "Damn".
 [Young Burns and Lily leave the theater, Burns covered in kisses]
We sneaked into the nearby Peabody Museum. There, under the smiling eyes
of four stuffed Eskimos, we expressed our love physically, as was the
style at the time.
 [a janitor inside the eskimo exhibit watches the two make love on the
 floor with glee]
-- Burns narrates love at the time, "Burns, Baby Burns"

Larry: Well, how do ya like that?  I have been in a museum.  So, what
       happened with you and Ma?
Burns: Oh, there was a terrible scandal.  Lily's family forced her to
       give you up, and bundled her off to a convent in the South Seas.
       I never heard from her again.  But I prattle on.  Tell me
       everything about your life.
Larry: Oh, what's to tell?  I was at the orphanage till I was 18, then I
       got my job at a souvenir stand.  Oh, and once I saw a blimp.
-- Uh-huh, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Mr. Burns shows Larry his luxurious suite of a room.  Larry is very
% impressed, and smothers Burns with gratitude.  Burns nicely fights him
% off, and shows him to the playroom, in case he ever gets bored.  On
% the other side of the playroom door is a play in progress.

Actor: ...you can't just eat the orange and throw the peel away!  A
       man's not a piece of fruit!
Burns: This show was supposed to close last week!  Close this show!
       Close it, I say!
        [Burns slams the door shut]
        [Larry comes back]
Larry: Hey, don't worry about it.  You're all right.
-- He probably saw the play as cartoon strips, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Homer is sleeping on his post at the SNPP when he awakens to stretch
% and finds Larry in a chair behind him.  Both are startled, and Homer
% panics when he learns he's talking to the boss' son, cleaning his
% panel from an unfinished jigsaw puzzle and turning on sector 7-G.

Larry: Ah, relax.  I don't wanna work.  I'm so lazy, I took lessons on a
       player piano.
Homer: Wow, that's really lazy.
Larry: Lazy?  You're not kiddin'.  Why, I'm like a rug on Valium, I'm
       talkin' lazy.
Homer: Soo lazy.
        [later, eating with his family]
Homer: ...and Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than
       you and me.  If I could be stranded on an island with anyone,
       it would definitely be Larry.
-- But I still prefer you for snuggling, "Burns, Baby Burns"

Marge: [bored] I think we've heard enough about Larry Burns for one
       evening.
Homer: Why?  It's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else
       today.
        [pan to the kids]

% At the Springfield Glen Country Club, Mr. Burns is preparing Larry to
% meet some high-class minglers at a dinner party. The first victim is
% Admiral Carstairs, an elderly man in a metal-laced admiral uniform.

Hey, Skipper, [slaps him in the back] good to meet ya.  Hoo, where'd you
start out, on the Merrimack?  Hey, I should talk.  I hope I look that
good when I'm 200.
-- Larry's charms at work, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Carstairs is not amused, and Larry is pulled aside by Mr. Burns, who
% notes to him that Carstairs is very sensitive about his age.  Just
% then, a distinguished, elderly woman wearing a tiara approaches Larry
% and Burns.

Woman: Oh, Monty, this must be the son I've heard so much about.  Larry,
       you must meet our daughter, the debutante.
       [reveals a short, chunky girl in glasses with a huge nose]
       She came out last spring.
Larry: Whoa!  Put her back in!  She's not done yet!
Woman: [through her glasses] Hmmph!
-- Tactless, yet rude, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Mr. Burns and Smithers are getting some food from the banquet table
% and discuss Larry.  Burns is starting to notice Larry is an unusual
% character and Smithers says he's rough around the edges.  Just then,
% Larry is seen on the other end of the serving table in a bib eating
% out of the shrimp pyramid.  "Pull up a seat, Pop.  You too, Chuckles.
% I mean, the food ain't great, but the portions are terrific."  An
% angry chef approaches Larry, glaring.  "Hey, I'm kiddin', relax. Hey,
% give my regards to Mrs. Boyardee."  Burns is disappointed in Larry's
% lack of refinement and sends for "the boys at Yale admissions."
%
% In Burns' office, a man and woman from Yale Admission go to Mr. Burns'
% desk to discuss Larry.

Burns: Well, did you meet Larry?
  Man: Oh, yes.  He made light of my weight problem, then suggested my
       motto be "semper fudge."  At that point, he told me to [making
       quotes with fingers] relax.
Burns: How were his test scores?
Woman: Let's just say this: he spelled "Yale" with a six.
-- Y0u mu5t 6e k1dd1ng!, "Burns, Baby Burns"

Burns: I see.  Well, I -- ooh, you know, I just remembered, it's time
       for my annual donation.  [brings out checkbook and pen]  I wonder
       how much I should give.
  Man: Well, frankly, test scores like Larry's would call for a very
       generous contribution. [opens book] For example, a score of 400
       would require a donation of new football uniforms, 300, a new
       dormitory, and in Larry's case, we would need an international
       airport.
Woman: Yale could use an international airport, Mr. Burns.
-- Then maybe a stock exchange market, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Burns gets ticked off: "Are you mad?  I'm not made of airports!"  He
% sends them off, and orders Smithers to summon Larry.  Smithers looks
% at the monitor screen of Sector 7-G and only finds a sign in Larry's
% chair reading "Gone Drinkin'"  Mr. Burns is furious.
%
% Homer and Larry are hanging out with the barflies at Moe's.

 Larry: Everybody go nuts! I'm buying!
        [to Moe]  Hey, Handsome, send the bill to my dad.
   Moe: Okay, but the last guy who charged a drink to Burns turned up in
        a landfill.
Barnet: [covered with garbage]  Yeah, but it was worth it.  [belches out
        a fish skeleton]
-- Already exhausted your life supply?, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Larry doesn't understand why everyone in town is against his dad,
% which he compares to a pussycat. To prove his point, he invites Homer
% over.
%
% An awkward silence overshadows the long dining room table where Mr.
% Burns, Homer and Larry are all having dinner.  Homer is making a pig
% of himself despite the silence, broken by Larry. He asks his dad to
% make an effort and "make with the yakkety-yak-yak."

Burns: You, Foodbag.  Do you have a son?
Homer: Yes, sir, I do.
Burns: And is he a constant disappointment?  Does he bring home nitwits
       and make you talk to them?
Homer: Oh, all the time!  Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse?
       He's a little wiener...
Burns: Fascinating.  Good night.
-- Milhouse? Fascinating?, "Burns, Baby Burns"

Larry: Dad, what's with you tonight?  I mean, I'm getting frostbite over
       here.
Burns: I'll tell you what's with me!  The humiliation of having a
       coarse, boorish ignoramus for a son!
Homer: [quietly]  Uh, I should go.
        [gets up slowly from his chair, about to go]
        [returns to the table, pigs up more food for the way home]
-- Keep fighting, I'll keep eating, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Larry questions his father's love, but Burns slams the door without
% answering.  Homer walks over to Larry to comfort him, while feeding
% off of a chicken leg.
%
% A rejected Larry walks out of Mr. Burns' house with Homer (still
% eating his chicken leg).

Larry: Sheesh, Dad and I, we started out great.  But now it's falling
       apart like a Chinese motorcycle.
Homer: It's so unfair.  You're everything a dad could hope for.
Larry: Yeah, I tell ya, I don't get no regard.  No regard at all.  No
       esteem, either.
-- Larry Dangerfield, "Burns, Baby Burns"

Homer: Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he
       loves you.  And that is a phony kidnapping.
Larry: Yeah, right.  I don't know.  Maybe I should just leave town.
Homer: [singing persuasively]  Phony kidnapping...
Larry: Nah... I know what I gotta do.  I gotta clean up my act.  No more
       joking around all the time.  No more slacking off at work.  And
       most important, no more booze!  [throws down glass of alcohol]  I
       know I can do it.
        [later...]
Burns: [reading a letter] "Your son has been kidnapped."
-- Well, almost, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:41]
%
% Police officers are busily searching for prints in Mr. Burns' office.
% Mr. Burns can't believe someone's kidnapped Larry, and won't rest
% until he's returned.  Smithers notes that as recently as two hours ago
% Mr. Burns wanted him out of his life, but it's the principle of the
% matter to Mr. Burns, who won't stomach being stolen from--whether it
% be a Sunday newspaper or Larry.

Wiggum: All right, Mr. B.  When the kidnappers call with the ransom
        demand, you tell them you'll leave the money under the big net
        in the park.
   Lou: And then down comes the net, right, Chief?
Wiggum: Heyyy, I like it!  I like it a lot!
-- "Burns, Baby Burns"

% At home, Marge sees the couch missing from the TV room, replaced by a
% mess of wires.  She grunts when she sees the wiring join other wires,
% all leading to the basement. She continues to follow the lead, up to
% finds Homer, Bart and Lisa watching TV with Larry inside the basement.

Marge: What are you doing in the basement?  It's like you're hiding out
       down here.
Homer: Hiding out??  Pfft.  Marge, you've been reading too many hideout
       books.
Marge: And what's that hitchhiker doing here?  Is every drifter we meet
       going to move in with us?
Homer: Of course not.  We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
-- Practical Homer, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Lisa introduces her to Larry.

 Bart: He's great at pointing out everyone's foibles.
Larry: Hey, how're ya doing.  Ooh!  Look at your hair!  What happened?
       You saw yourself in the mirror?
 Bart: He's kiddin', Mom.  But seriously, I'd love to have hair like
       yours.  I just can't get the zoning permits.
 Lisa: Hey, that reminds me, Mom; Buckingham Palace called.  They want
       their hat back.
        [Marge growls]
Larry: Hey kids, how about a hand for your Mom?  She's all right.
        [everyone applauds and cheers for Marge]
Marge: [more shy than annoyed]  Oh, yeah, thank you.
-- Open mike night at the Simpsons, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Mr. Burns and Smithers are at the police station, where Wiggum scarfs
% down doughnuts while his band of officers work on tracking down
% information on tracking maps.  The phone rings.  Mr. Burns answers.

Burns: Ahoy-hoy?
Homer: [speaking through a kazoo]  Hello, Mr. Burns.  This is the
       kidnapper.  Do you miss your son?
Burns: Yes, I'm missing one son.  Return it immediately!
Homer: If you really love Larry, prove it, and you can have him back
       today.
Burns: Oh, how much proof do you need?  5,000?  6,000?  I swear, that's
       all I've got.
Homer: Don't you care about your son?  This is more important than
       money.
Burns: More important than money?  Who is this?
Homer: Uh...  [panics, loses control of the phone]  Just a second.
       [hangs up]
-- Still better than giving out your name, "Burns, Baby Burns"

Wiggum: Beautiful.  Eddie, did you trace the phone number?
 Eddie: Sure did, Chief.
Wiggum: [reading paper] 5-5-5... Aw, geez, that's gotta be phony.
        [discards the number into a fire]
-- "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Everyone's still in the basement.  Bart, Lisa, Homer and Larry play
% cards.

Lisa: Hey, I think I got a Pai Gow.
Bart: [groans]  I hate Pai Gow.  Can't we just play Quang Jong?
-- Those games they play, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Marge becomes impatient and wants to go back upstairs, but Homer
% hastily objects.  On TV, Kent Brockman, saddled in a newschopper,
% reports that Mr. Burns' son has been kidnapped.  Marge is shocked, and
% doesn't approve more when she learns it's a hoax.

Marge: I want you to take Larry back to Mr. Burns right now, before you
       get in a lot of trouble.
Homer: But the.. wh.. Marge!  It's broad daylight and there's cops
       everywhere!
Marge: No excuses.  Just do it.
        [Homer reluctantly obeys and takes Larry upstairs]
        [they walk out the house, to be spotted by Kent's air newsteam]
 Kent: Of course, we'll bring you updates just as soon as they...  Oh!
       Wait a minute!  There they are!
        [Homer shreaks and both he and Larry break for Homer's car and
        drive off]
 Kent: Appearing in broad daylight with police everywhere, ladies and
       gentlemen, there's only one word for that: idiocy.
Marge: [groans]
-- Still not tired of being wrong all the time?, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Homer recklessly drives Larry and himself to a hiding place.  They
% drive through a narrow alley, throwing off the police.  Homer and
% Larry get out and try to climb the fence.  Hanging onto it, the fence
% breaks forward and slams into the ground.

Larry: We've gotta find someplace to hide.
Homer: [gasps]  The abandoned warehouse!
        [they enter a dilapidated warehouse]
        [inside, people are busily working]
Homer: D'oh!  Stupid economic recovery!
-- "Burns, Baby Burns"

% The next resort is a local costume shop.  Moments later, two men
% dressed in a gorilla and organ-grinder costume exit the shop.  The
% owner of the store catches Homer and Larry sitting fearfully inside
% the bathroom, and orders them out.
%
% Running out of options, Homer declares that they need to find a place
% that no one would ever go to.  Instantaneously, Homer spots a movie
% theater playing "Too Many Grandmas," starring Olympia Dukakis and Bo
% Derek.

Bo Derek: [v.o.] Drive faster, Grandma!  Grandma's gaining on us!
-- Homer and Larry watch "Too Many Grandmas," "Burns, Baby Burns"

  Homer: [chuckles]  They'll never look for us here.
  Larry: Yeah.  This place is emptier than a Scottish pay toilet.
Moleman: [behind them]  Shh!  Some people are trying to watch the movie.
  Homer: You don't like it, call the cops.  [throws popcorn at him]
-- Professional hiding-out, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Moleman excuses himself out of the auditorium. Soon enough, police
% cars surround the theater, with one carrying Mr. Burns and Smithers.
% Kent Brockman does a news report.

This is Kent Brockman, live from the Aztec theater, where police have
learned that kidnapper Homer Simpson and hostage Larry Burns are inside,
talking loudly.
-- "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Worried Marge and Bart and Lisa watch the news coverage.

Marge: Oh, give yourself up, Homie!
 Bart: No, Dad!  Shoot your way out!
Marge: [grunts at Bart]
        [On TV, Homer barges through some doors in the theater, and is
        shot quite graphically through various parts of the body.]
  All: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!
 Kent: A bloody end for Homer Simpson... is just one of several possible
       outcomes according to our computer simulation.  Now, here's how
       it would look if the police killed him with a barrage of
       baseballs.
 Lisa: We've gotta go down there and help Dad!
        [they walk out]
        [Only heard on TV, Homer is pelted with a barrage of baseballs]
Homer: Ouch!  Oooch!  Eeech!  Ouch!  Oooch!  [whining] Oh, stop it!

 Burns: [through amplifier] The negotiations have failed.  Shoot him!
-- Hostage negociation subliminal tapes at work, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Wiggum takes the safety off the gun and prepares to shoot when Larry

          this gawking rabble.
          [away from amplifier]  Smithers, take off my belt.
Smithers: [giddily]  With pleasure, sir!
-- Don't give out too much clues, now, "Burns, Baby Burns"

% Homer intervenes.

Homer: Maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime?
       All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love.  I'm a
       father myself, sir.  And sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious
       [Bart glares], or boring [Lisa glares], or stinky [Maggie
       glares], but they can always count on one thing: their father's
       unconditional love.

Burns: Uh... well... uh... [hugs Larry]  There there, sonny boy. I
       suppose I have been a bit... Oh, no, I can't do it.  It's just
       not me.  I'm sorry, Larry.  I can't be the family that you need.
Larry: Aw, that's okay.  I got a wife and kids.  Oh, that reminds me.
       They're probably wondering where I went.  I told 'em I'm going
       for coffee.  That was a week ago.
