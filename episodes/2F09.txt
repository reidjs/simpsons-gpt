> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
===============================================================================
How could the cat's meows be heard when it is underwater?  {dh}

Homer pulls the pan from thin air.  {dh}

The sound of the helicopter's rotor blades during Arnie's radio
broadcast don't sound as though it had crashed.  {dh}

The parking lot behind the back yard conflicts with many, many episodes,
most notably 1F22.  {th}

Isn't Bart supposed to be on the school bus by the time Homer has to be
at work?  {mk}

The space around Homer's parking spot closes in on him.  {dh}

Homer's ID card is missing from his shirt.  {dh}

In other episodes, Homer's chair has been nicer than that stool.  {dh}

As Homer adds "Econo Save" to the list, his last E appears fully drawn
in one frame before he's actually finished writing it.

The buttons on the Buzz Cola machine are on the left.  Most pop machines
have the buttons on the right, underneath the coin slot.  {av}

The dining room layout is different.  {th}

Things appear and disappear from the dining room table.  {dh}

In the first shot of Grandpa having dinner with OFF, he has something to
eat, and a napkin.  But after that shot, there is nothing on the table.
{ag}

The Stonecutter meetings are Wednesday nights.  But Moe's already busy
Wednesday -- he reads to the homeless then.  See 9F14.  {dh}

I thought it took more than following two people just once to one place
to be considered "stalking".  {mk}

Lenny's coffee cup turns into an egg sandwich.  {dh}

Homer's already saved everyone's life in 8F04.  {dh}

It appears to me that membership is signified by a ring.  Where's
Grampa's ring?  {mk}

Number One's book disappears.  {dh}

Despite the water flowing in the basement for days between plumber
visits, the water level does not rise.  {ddg}

The plumber's wrench disappears.  {dh}

Homer's rulebook disappears.  {dh}

When Homer drives through the tunnel under the freeway, the paintings on
the left are all different in the first shot.  In the second, there are
no paintings on the left side, and all the paintings on the right side
are copies of the Mona Lisa (which was also one of the paintings on the
left in the first shot!)  {mk}

The stripes on the shields on the Stonecutter Mugs go from diagonal to
horizontal and back to diagonal.  {ddg}

The Declaration of Independence signing scene is incorrect.  (see below)

During the Stonecutters' song, Number One can be seen raising his cup
and singing along with the others (at least twice).  But when the song
finishes, Number One's cup disappears.  {ag}

Homer has never had that birthmark before.  (Why wouldn't Dr. Hibbert
have seen the birthmark during a physical?  Or Lenny, Carl, Mr. Burns,
or Smithers during showers at the plant or the plant physical?  And why
wouldn't Grampa have noticed it and mentioned it to the Stonecutters a
long time ago?  {av})

Why would Homer wonder if there's a God?  He met him in 9F01.

In the pool game, the cue ball changes color after striking the front
ball of the rack; also, all 16 balls go into a pocket, which is a foul
(OOPS - a foul EXCEPT when the Chosen One does it).  {ddg}

Miss Hoover's door should be on the other side -- see 9F03, 7F19, 7F02.
{mk}

In Miss Hoover's classroom, the calendar (which says "March") goes from
five weeks (which is normal) to four, and Lisa begins in the second
column from the wall but is soon in the third.  (Also, Lisa and Janey
are in the front row this time.)  {ddg}

The lockers should be full-length rather than half-length -- see 1F07,
8F15.  {mk}

Bart paddles Homer right-handed, and Lisa is ready to paddle him left-
handed.  It should be reversed.  {av}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Tony Hill: This was a positively zany and unpredictable episode.  Homer
    shines at his moronic best.  Some of the gags detracted from the
    credibility but not the humor of this episode.  Best of all, we
    added a new song to our repertory.  I give "Homer the Great" an A.

Matthew Kurth: On its own, this episode is pretty good.  However, it
    discards continuity almost completely and is just too over-the-top
    for me.  The outstanding drinking song stole (and saved) the show.
    7/10

Mike Kraus: What a great episode tonight.  One of my favorites in a long
    time.  Seems like a pretty great idea for men of a town to have a
    club like that.  Maybe the name we should call Simpsons fans is
    Stonecutters!

Dave Hall: I liked it.  Two thumbs up.  Patrick Stewart was great.
    There was a lot of DYN/FF stuff in this episode.  I'm sure a lot of
    you guys/gals are busy right now listing them.

Warren Hagey: I think it was great, IMHO the best this season.  The
    repetitive jokes were excellent and Moe's objection to the oath is
    the funniest thing I've heard in my life.  A+

Bailey Irwin: The best shows combine Homerish goofiness with blistering
    social satire and a kind of Pythonesque surrealism.  It's been done
    before, but tonight may be the first time they've done all that in
    ONE plot, with the elements overlapping totally.  Brilliant.  A+.

Marc Singer: It was decent, but I left it feeling it was decidedly
    average.  Perhaps most irritating was the fact that by the time they
    really got to the interesting part of the episode, Homer as Chosen
    One, it was already 2/3 over.  Not a bad show, but not a great one
    either.

John J. Wood: This is the first time I've ever been disappointed by a
    episode with "Homer" in its title.  First, the plot was simply too
    UNbelievable.  Second, many of its gags just didn't work: They were
    either predictable, stale, cheesy, or just plain embarrassing.
    Grade: C.

Don Del Grande: In line with the subject material, this episode pulls a
    "gentleman's B"; good overall, but nothing really stood out.  For
    once, it had a decent ending.

Yours truly: Hmm.  Swartzwelder usually writes excellent episodes, but I
    didn't enjoy this one much.  I hate to say it, but the continuity
    errors were glaring and wrecked my enjoyment a little.  Thank God
    for the Stonecutter's song!  Grade: C-.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Parchment translation

Bob Yantosca makes his best effort at translating the parchment:
    
    OBSTUPUI STETERUNTOUR
    COMAE, ET VOX PAUCIBUS MAESIT.

    - OBSTUPUI: (noun) loosely derived from 'obstupesco', to be
      dumbfounded.  I take it to mean "the dumbfounded" or "the
      astonished".
    - STETERUNTOUR: No such form in Latin.  The verb must come from
      'sto, stare, steti, status' (to stand).  The closest forms I could
      find are:
        - STARENTUR: Imperfect Subjunctive Passive (they might be stood)
        - STANTUR: Present Active Passive (they were stood)
        - STENTUR: Present Subjunctive Passive (let them stand)
    - COMAE: (noun) plural of 'coma', hair.  In English 'hair' is a
      collective noun, but in Latin, the plural is used.
    - PAUCIBUS (adj).  Dative plural of 'paucus' (to the few, to a few)
    - MAESIT: (verb) obviously derived from 'maereo' (to mourn).
      Confusing because there shouldn't be a 'maesit' form unless maereo
      is declined 'maereo, maerere, maesi, maesum', which is irregular.
    - So, putting it all together, and substituting for STANTUR for
      STETERUNTOUR (this makes the most sense), we get (drumroll,
      please):
      
      The hair of the dumbstruck [people] is stood on end;
      And a voice mourned to the few.

>> Errors in signing the Declaration of Independence

Matthew Kurth notices, "Actually, when the Declaration of Independence
    was signed, the signers' intent was to sever ties to and post
    grievances against King George, rather than create a democracy - at
    the time they had no idea what form the government would take.
    Furthermore, the Second Continental Congress created 13 independent
    states, rather than a single nation."

>> Orville Redenbacher

Tony Hill asserts, "Orville Redenbacher is an entrepreneur who founded a
    popcorn company.  He sold out twenty or more years ago, but
    continues to serve as the commercial spokesperson for his product."

>> Mr. T

Tony Hill explains, "Mr. T was a character in the short-lived series
    'The A Team' in the 1980s.  It's unfortunate that he'd want to kill
    Homer, after Homer wrote a song about him.  'I pity the fool who
    doesn't like he,' as the song was quoted in 'Homer's Barbershop
    Quartet.'"

>> Who _isn't_ a Stonecutter?

Elson Trinidad noticed some notable absences from the ranks of the
    Stonecutters.  Here are his explanations:
    
    1.  Ned Flanders: Refuses to be involved in "evil, godless"
    activities.
    
    2.  Rev. Lovejoy: Ditto.
    
    3.  Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Either the Stonecutters discriminate
    against Indians, or Apu could not afford to let go of the Quick-E-
    Mart every Wednesday night.
    
    4.  Snake: He is a stonecutter, but in a different sense.
    
    5.  Otto: Quit after finding out that Stonecutters don't get stoned.
    
    6.  Lionel Hutz: No lawyers allowed.

%
% The scene opens on the Stern Lecture Plumbing van ("I told you not to
% flush that"), then focuses on the Simpsons' basement window.  A
% plumber stands in a foot of water in front of a leaky pipe.

Plumber: Looks like you got a leak.
  Marge: Could you start fixing it pretty soon?  The basement is getting
         awfully flooded.  And I think the cat's down there.
          [Snowball II meows balefully from underwater]
Plumber: Yeah, I probably won't be able to get the parts I need for two,
         three weeks and that's if I order them today -- which I won't.
  Marge: Oh, dear.
          [his pager beeps; he looks, it shows "Low Battery"]
Plumber: Hmm, emergency call.  Gotta go.  [starts to leave]
  Homer: What should we do until you get back?
Plumber: Ehh, put a pan down there.
          [Homer puts one down; it floats away]
  Homer: Aw, it didn't work!
-- A good use of $75/hour, "Homer the Great"

% On Homer's way to work, he gets stuck behind a huge lineup of cars on
% the freeway.

Homer: Lousy traffic jams...[laughs] the traffic report will get me out
       of this one.
        [turns on KBBL]
Arnie: [from a helicopter] This is Arnie Pie!  Looks like we got a
       little accident that's backing traffic up as far as this reporter
       can see.
        [camera pulls back; the helicopter is causing the jam]
-- At least he's not lying, "Homer the Great"

% Homer arrives at work quite late and pulls into the last available
% spot, right on the end of a row.  From the other side of a fence, Bart
% waves to him from his bedroom window: "Hi Dad!"  Homer makes
% dismissive noises and walks towards the power plant entrance.  As he
% gets close, Lenny and Carl pull up in their cars into parking spots
% right at the entrance.  "Hey," asks Homer suspiciously, "how come you
% guys got such great parking places?"  Lenny answers quietly, "It's a
% secret."  Carl tells him "Shh!  Shut up!"
%
% Homer walks to his station at work and sits on his chair, which
% promptly collapses.  He looks at the bottom of the stool, which reads
% "Econo-save budget stool: Factory Second".  "All right, Econo-save,
% you just made the list!"  Homer says menacingly, pulling out "Homer's
% Revenge List" and adding "Econo Save" to the end.
%
% He walks into the room where Carl and Lenny work and asks, "Hey!  Will
% you guys help me fix my -- " but stops when he sees them sitting in
% big, comfortable, vibrating chairs with their names on them.  "Hey...
% how come you guys got better chairs than me."  Lenny answers him
% again, "It's a secret!" and again Carl warns, "Shh!  Shut up!"
%
% At the soda machine, Lenny presses a ring with a special pattern onto
% it into a special place on the machine and gets a soda without paying
% for it.  Homer walks up, starts putting change in some change, and
% asks the boys if they want to go bowling tonight.  "Naw, we're busy,"
% replies Lenny, and Carl adds, "Yeah, we got, er, things to do."  "Like
% what?" asks Homer, slyly.  "Uh, it's a secret," says Lenny for the
% third time.  Carl, in the middle of drinking, stops and eyes Lenny,
% leaving Homer to say, "Shut up!"
%
% At dinner, Homer tells the family about his day.

Homer: So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays and they
       don't tell me where they go.  It's like a conspiracy.
 Bart: A conspiracy, eh?  You think they might be involved in the
       Kennedy assassination in some way?
Homer: I do...now.  Anyway, I'm going to follow them tonight and see
       where they go.
Marge: Oh, Homer, don't start stalking people again.  It's so _illegal_.
       Remember when you were stalking Charles Kuralt because you
       thought he dug up your garden?
Homer: Well, something did!
Marge: I don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
Homer: Oh, OK, have it your own way, Marge.  I'll be back in a minute
       [gets up]: I'm...[sly] going outside.  To..._stalk_...Lenny and
       Carl.  [realizes] D'oh!
-- Homer has a garden?, "Homer the Great"

% Homer's head pops up from some bushes, then disappears again.  He
% tiptoes up to Lenny's car, attaches a can of yellow paint to the
% trailer hitch, pokes a hole in the bottom of it, then jumps out of
% sight just in time as Lenny and Carl get in and drive off.  "Heh heh
% heh, all I have to do is follow the yellow drip road," Homer chuckles.
%
% The pair stop in front of a strange-looking building.  Homer's mouth
% opens wide in amazement.  Getting out, Lenny asserts, "There's our
% secret meeting place."  Carl agrees, "Yes.  Let's go inside."  "Sounds
% good," answers Lenny, and the two walk in.  A large man in a strange
% robe guards the door menacingly.  Homer walks up innocently, humming,
% and when the man blocks his entrance, he turns around quickly, still
% humming.
%
% Inside, a large open hall is filled with men all wearing the same odd
% robes.  Homer, not deterred, is sprawled over the glass-dome skylight.

  Homer: [giggles] I can see everything and they're none the wiser!
          [the glass starts to crack, then it breaks and he falls in]
    Moe: An intruder!
Skinner: He will pay the ultimate price.
Hibbert: Yes...the ultimate price.
    Moe: Get outta here!  [tosses him out the front door]
-- "Ultimate" is relative, "Homer the Great"

% At work the next day, Homer confronts his two chums.

Homer: I saw weird stuff in that place last night.  Weird, strange,
       sick, twisted, eerie, godless, evil stuff!  And I want in.
 Carl: We don't, uh, know what you're talking about, Homer.
Lenny: And you can't join the Stonecutters because it's too exclusive!
 Carl: [sighs] Well, it was a real nice secret organization we had once.
-- And he'll tell two friends, and so on..., "Homer the Great"

Homer: Stonecutters, eh?  How do I join?
Lenny: There are only two ways to gain membership: be the son of a
       Stonecutter --
Homer: Next?
Lenny: -- or, save the life of a Stonecutter.
        [starts to eat a sandwich]
Homer: Hey!  [grabs it, stomps on it]
       I saved your life!  That egg sandwich could have killed you by
       cholesterol.
Lenny: Pfft, forget it, Homer.  While it has been established that eggs
       contain cholesterol, it has not yet been proven conclusively that
       they actually raise the level of serum cholesterol in the human
       blood stream.
Homer: So one of those Egg Council creeps got to you too, huh?
Lenny: Aw, you've got it all wrong, Homer.  It's not like that.
        [a man in an egg costume creeps, then runs, away]
Homer: You'd better run, egg!
-- The insidious Egg Council, "Homer the Great"

% Homer whines to Marge in bed.

   Homer: Why don't people like me, Marge?
   Marge: Mmm, everyone likes you, you're a wonderful person.
   Homer: Why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for
          jerks?
   Marge: I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer.
   Homer: It is.  It's been happening to me all my life.
           [flashback to kids climbing into a treefort]
     Boy: Hey Billy!  Hey Joey!  Come on in.  There's plenty of room.
          Sorry, not you, Homer.
   Homer: Why not?

          But you let in Homer Glumplich.

   Homer: I felt so left out.
   Marge: Kids can be so cruel.

% Homer continues to mope the next day at dinner.

Homer: I'd give anything to get into the Stonecutters.
 Lisa: What do they do there, Dad?
  Abe: I'm a member --
Homer: What do they do?  What _don't_ they do?  [laughs] Oh, they do so
       many things they never stop.  Oh, the things they do there, my
       stars.
 Lisa: You don't know _what_ they do there, do you?
Homer: Not as such, no.
  Abe: I'm a Stonecutter --
 Bart: Dad, remember those self-hypnosis courses we took to help us
       ignore Grampa?
Homer: Do I ever!  It's five years later and I _still_ think I'm a
       chicken.  I'm a chicken, Marge!
Marge: I know, I know.
 Bart: Maybe we should be listening to him now.
-- Bart, the voice of reason, "Homer the Great"

  Abe: I'm a member!
Homer: Huh?
  Abe: What?
Homer: What?
  Abe: Huh?
 Lisa: You're a member of the Stonecutters, Grampa?
  Abe: Oh, sure.  Let's see...[pulls out wallet, starts going through
       it] I'm an elk, a Mason, a communist.  I'm the president of the
       Gay and Lesbian Alliance for some reason...ah, here it is.  The
       Stonecutters.
Homer: This is it!  My ticket in: they have to let me in if I'm the son
       of a member.  I'll take this communist one too.  [walks out]
-- McCarthy, no Springfieldian he, "Homer the Great"

% Homer drags Abe into the next meeting.

Homer: Coming through!  Can't throw me out, my father's a member.  I'm
       in, I'm in.
Lenny: OK, OK, Homer, you're in.  Just don't point that..._thing_ at me.
Homer: [pushes Grampa over] Aw, thanks, Lenny.  When am I going to be
       initiated?
 Carl: As soon as Number One gets here.
Homer: [scoffing] Number One?  Heh heh, what kind of stupid weiner name
       is that?  [dumb voice] Hello, my name is Number One.  Hee hee...
       [tiring of it] and so forth.
-- Mockery has its day, "Homer the Great"

Lenny: We call each other by number, not by name.  Carl is Number
       Fourteen, I'm Number Twelve.  Burnsie's Number 29.
Homer: [incredulous] _You_ outrank Mr. Burns here?
Lenny: Sure.  Watch -- hey, 29, get over here!
        [Burns walks over; Lenny pinches his nose]
Burns: [shudders] Thank you, Sir.  May I have another?

Homer: OK, OK, I didn't ask for your life story.
-- Homer the sympathetic listener, "Homer the Great"

% The blindfolded Homer is led to the front of the stage by Moe.

      Carl: Let the initiation begin.
Number One: All Stonecutters must take the Leap of Faith.  If you
            survive this five-story plunge, your character will be
            proven.
             [Homer whimpers]
       Moe: Happy landings!  [pushes him]

     Homer: [from the bottom] I think I have to do it again.  My
            blindfold came off.
-- Playing by the rules, "Homer the Great"

% Number One leads the blindfolded Homer to the next test.

Number One: This ritual is called...Crossing the Desert.
             [Homer gets paddled on the butt by Hibbert, Skinner,
            Brockman, Krusty, Moe, Quimby, and Willy in succession]
Number One: And this, we call the Unblinking Eye.
             [he gets paddled by the same people in reverse order]
     Homer: Hey...have you ever noticed that the Crossing the Desert is
            a lot like the Unblinking Eye.  And it's _exactly_ like the
            Wreck of the Hesperus.
Number One: And now, the final ordeal: the Paddling of the Swollen
            Ass...With Paddles.
-- Homer's initiation continues, "Homer the Great"

% At last, Homer takes the final oath.

     Homer: And by the sacred parchment, I swear that if I reveal the
            secrets of the Stonecutters, may my stomach become bloated
            and my head be plucked of all but three hairs --
       Moe: Um, I think he should have to take a different oath.
Number One: Everyone takes the same oath.  Welcome to the club, Number
            908.  You have joined the Sacred Order of the Stonecutters
            who, since ancient times, have split the rocks of ignorance
            that obscure the light of knowledge and truth.  Now let's

% Back in the Simpson basement, the pipe is still leaking.

Plumber: Well, to be honest, I never got around to ordering that part
         for you, so, uh, it's still going to be a couple of weeks.
  Homer: [sly] Oh, really?
Plumber: Yes...
  Homer: Really?
Plumber: Yes, yes.
  Homer: But what if I were to shake your hand in _this_ wise?
          [he and the plumber do a ridiculous handshake and pull up
         their shirts to reveal Stonecutters T-shirts]
Plumber: Whoa, I didn't realize you were a member!

% On the way to work, Homer finds himself in a huge traffic jam again.
% "Heh heh heh, so long, suckers!" he calls, driving down a seldom-used
% road.  He stops in front of a big rock, pushes a Stonecutter garage
% door opener, and the rock splits in two, revealing a covered tunnel
% that leads straight to work.  Its walls are lined with paintings;
% Handel's "Water Music" plays over speakers.
%
% Homer parks at the plant next to the fence again.  Bart walks up on
% the other side and asks, "Same old space, huh, Dad?"  Homer affirms,
% "Yes, but they gave me these rollerblades so I can glide to the front
% door."  "Gliding" proves to be more like balancing with difficulty,
% but Homer laughs and says, "Sweet!" nonetheless.
%
% At Homer's work station, a workman brings in a new, nice chair for
% him.  Carl and Lenny watch.

Homer: Jealous?
Lenny: Well...no, we've got the same chair.
Homer: [smug] You're jealous.
Lenny: Your membership pack.  [hands it to him]
Homer: [pulls out a decal] What's this?
Lenny: You put that sticker on your car so you won't get any tickets.
       And this other one keeps paramedics from stealing your wallet
       while they're working on you.
 Carl: Oh, and don't bother calling 911 any more...here's the _real_

% Marge walks in with a phone message for Homer, who drinks a beer on

Marge: Homer, a man who called himself You-Know-Who just invited you to
       a secret wink-wink at the you-know-what.  You certainly are
       popular now that you're a Stonecutter.
Homer: Oh, yeah.  [reads from a book] "Beer busts, beer blasts, keggers,
       stein hoists, A.A. meetings, beer nights..." It's wonderful,
       Marge!  I've never felt so accepted in all my life.  These people
       look deep within my soul and assign me a number based on the
       order in which I joined.  [sniffs tearily]
-- A true measure of worth, "Homer the Great"

% At the next meeting, everyone raises their glasses and sings.

Everyone: Who controls the British crown?

Number One: Homer Simpson, for your continuing and baffling desecration

            from the stonecutters forever.  And as a final humiliation,
            you must walk home naked, dragging behind you the Stone of

% Homer, newly dressed in a special outfit, runs out onto a stage and
% marvels as the rest of the Stonecutters bow down.  "Wow.  Mental note:

 Lisa: "Beware the Ides of March."
Homer: No!
 Lisa: Dad, I know you think you're happy now, but it's not going to
       last forever.
Homer: Everything lasts forever.
 Lisa: Don't you see?  Getting what you want all the time will
       ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
Homer: Remove the girl...

% At the bowling alley, Homer bowls with the Chosen One ball.  He hits

% Wiggum unholsters his gun and shoots it down.  "Another strike for the
% chosen one!  Hurrah!" calls the assembled group of Stonecutters.  "Woo
% hoo!" cheers Homer.
%
% At the pool table, Homer breaks, and all the balls follow roundabout
% paths to the right corner pocket.  "Well that's just an excellent
% break," comments Moe, and the others agree.  The camera pulls back to
% reveal a man tilting the table strongly.
%
% At the poker table, Carl shows a pair of tens, Wiggum a pair of kings,

   Homer: [bored] Oh, I win again, don't I. Woo hoo.
           [everyone congratulates him]
          You know, I think you guys are letting me win.
Everyone: No!  No...
   Homer: From now on you want me to be honest with me.  I mean, I'm not

% In Lisa's class at school, Skinner walks in.

 Skinner: [to Lisa] The Grand Exulted Leader requests a moment of your
          time.  [claps hands] Class dismissed!
Children: Yay!
  Hoover: Yay.
   Homer: [walks in] Lisa, you were right.  My happiness _is_ fading.
    Lisa: You're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has
          isolated you from other human beings.
   Homer: What do you mean, isolated?
           [echo in the class: "ated...ated...ated...ated"]
    Lisa: Well, maybe you could reach out to the community and help
          other people.
   Homer: Hmm...I _could_ help others.  [slowly] I'll get a bunch of
          monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the civil war.
    Lisa: Dad, that doesn't help people!
   Homer: Couldn't hurt...unless the monkeys start hurting people.
          Which they almost certainly would.
-- It was the best of times..., "Homer the Great"

% At the next Stonecutter meeting, Homer bangs his gavel as the crowd
% toast each other with beer steins.  They turn to face him and cheer.

Homer: Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson: helping others makes
       our own lives better and makes us better people.  So instead of
       just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use
       what we have to help the less fortunate.

  Moe: He's gone mad with power like that Albert Schweitzer guy.
-- Albert, Adolf, what's the difference, "Homer the Great"

% So Homer starts a "Stonecutters Daycare Center" in front of the
% Stonecutter temple.  Homer seesaws with a bunch of kids at once;
% Barney is covered with children as he walks; Lenny and Carl play
% jumprope with a child.  At the top of a twirly tube slide, Moe calls
% "Whee!" and slides down with a child in his lap.  Only the child makes
% it to the bottom, though, as Moe calls out, "Ooh, for the love of God!
% Somebody get the jaws of life."
%
% Herman throws a ball at a child with his arm, and Monty Burns tries to
% push a child in a swing.  "Higher!" screams the hardly-moving child,
% "Higher!"  Monty intones, "Oh, I'll give you higher, my filthy little
% urchin," and pushes hard.  He forgets to move out of the way, though,
% and gets smucked in the face first, then the back of the head.
% "You've won this round," he concedes, only to get smacked by the child
% again.
%
% Homer assembles the crew to repaint an apartment building covered with
% graffiti.  The superintendent walks out and kisses Homer.  "It looks
% so much better...a beautiful sky blue," she admires as a helicopter
% crashes into it.
%
% At home, the pets watch Homer with respect as he talks to his family.

     Homer: You were right, Lisa: I've never felt so spiritually
            fulfilled.  And with my brothers the Stonecutters behind me,
            this is the beginning of a better world for all of us.
       Moe: We've got to kill him!
Number One: Take it easy, Moe.  Let's hear from the Stonecutter world
            council before we act too rashly.
   Orville: Kill him.
 Nicholson: Kill him.
     Mr. T: Kill the fool!
      Bush: I'm afraid I have to disagree with Orville, Jack, and Mr.
            Can't we just do something to his voice box?
-- Sage World Council advice, "Homer the Great"

Number One: We might as well face the truth: as long as we're
            Stonecutters, he will control our lives.
       Moe: Maybe...but _maybe_ we don't want to be Stonecutters no
            more.

    Marge: [walking in] Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with

    Homer: Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club.
    Marge: Oh, Homey.  You know, you _are_ a member of a very exclusive
           club.
    Homer: Black panthers?
    Marge: No, the family Simpson, which has just five members -- and
