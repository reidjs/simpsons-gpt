Blackboard :- I will not celebrate meaningless milestones.
              I will not celebrate meaningless mi/ at cutoff.

Lisa's Solo:- None due to shortened intro.

Couch      :- The family run in and sit on the couch, which is missing
              its middle cushion.  When the FOX logo appears in the
              corner of the screen, Homer jumps up, rips it off, and
              stomps on it angrily.

> Did you notice...
===============================================================================
    ... Skinner sweating as he talked on the phone?
    ... Ned's parents were beatniks living in Greenwich Village, New
        York?

Dave Hall:
    ... the tiny feet on young Homer's T-Shirt?  (cf. 9F14)
    ... Marge wears a red strapped dress in the film?
    ... Homer's cake only has six candles?  (Is that for dog or Homer
        years?  :>)
    ... Homer doesn't follow the tradition of first blowing out the
        candles and then opening his gifts?
    ... Homer only receives one gift?
    ... Homer actually tried to put his beard out with his hands?
    ... Abe isn't wearing slippers in the film?
    ... compared to the other kids, Bart's geode is puny?

        follow him?
    ... Martin isn't impressed with SLH?
    ... SLH's exposed eyelid when Nelson petted him?
    ... the sadness in every kid's face but Martin's when Bart took SLH
        away?
    ... the glee on Lunch lady Doris's face as she inhales the flavor of
        her "horse" soup?  And that her apron isn't even soiled?
    ... Willy doesn't want anyone in the way when he lands on the
        ground?
    ... Willy's butt imprint on the superintendent?
    ... Ned's several diplomas hanging on the walls of the Principal's
        office?
    ... it sounds like Skinner only owns one pair of underwear?

        doesn't stop Bart?
    ... Homer only appears at breakfast and in Bart's bedroom?
    ... who filmed those OFF private moments?

Tony Hill:
    ... nobody notices the box walked?  (Perhaps the class was
        desensitized from its visit to the box factory.)
    ... the frequent appearance of clocks in this episode?
    ... the school heating system uses technology similar to that for
        tracking objects at Mount Splashmore?
    ... Willie leaves a greasemark on the Superintendent?
    ... the sun sets on a line with the shoreline?  How can this be if
        Springfield is near the Atlantic?
    ... Skinner calls his CO "Colonel," yet officers only address their
        subordinates by rank?

Vaughn Jett:
    ... the clock in the background advances 10 minutes during Little
        Bart's five-second potty scene?
    ... the drink flavors behind the counter in the Kwik-E-Mart are
        "RED" and "GREEN"?
    ... the "plan" Bart comes up with to get Flanders fired doesn't
        actually involve any action on Bart's or Homer's part?
    ... the flag in Skinner's bedroom has 27 stars?

Matthew Kurth:
    ... the calendar is on April in Bart's class?
    ... OFF's doormat has fake plastic flowers on it?

Don Del Grande:
    ... Maggie smiles when she stamps the floor; the others are angry?

Adam Mottershead:
    ... the MP at the gate is looking _right at_ Bart, letting him
        through, despite the "secret project" at the base?

> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
===============================================================================
The logo is one frame behind Homer's arm movements (for example, when
Homer throws the logo down, it remains suspended in mid-air for one
frame).  {ddg}

When Maggie goes back to the couch, she goes through Homer's right leg.
{ddg}

The water spray doesn't actually get Homer wet.  (It's only afterwards
we briefly see water streaming down his head.)  {dh}

Young Homer's car seems to roll out of the driveway, yet the water
stream from the hose seems to follow a different course.  {dh}

Bart is playing the old home movies on their _green_ refrigerator, in a
*lighted* kitchen.  The image should have a high green tint, and should
be very faint in that kind of light.  {mk}

The projector cord appears to stop short of dangling over the edge of
the kitchen table.  {dh}

When Homer's birthday book falls, it should be upside down.  {dh}

It would be a little hard for Bart to see the film with his back to the
fridge.  (This is corrected in the next scene, though.)  {dh}

How could Homer afford a Super-8 *sound* movie camera?  (Matthew Kurth
{mk})

Marge pulls her potato out of thin air.  (Or did she pull it out of her
hair? cf. 7G08) {dh}

Lisa gets her books for school, yet she doesn't carry them onto the
school bus.  {dh}

Bart's geode switches hands when he arrives on the bus.  {dh}

Kids switch places on the school bus.  Also note Nelson and one of the
purple-haired twins vanish.  {dh}

Bart's geode disappears.  {dh}

The ruler on the blackboard ledge changes size.  {dh}

The number of Martin's cookies changes.  {dh}

Martin's cookies don't appear on Ms.  Krabappel until needed.  {dh}

Once again, Martin's pens are missing from his pocket in some scenes.
{dh}

Aren't geodes metamorphic, not of volcanic origin as Martin (IQ 216)
described?  {th}

Mrs. Hoover's classroom clock depicts ~9:21, yet Bart presents SLH to
his classroom at 10:22.  {dh}

Skinner's microphone doesn't seem to have an on/off button.  {dh}

Skinner's soiled look disappears in several scenes.  {dh}

Overhead air ducts disappears in some scenes.  {dh}

The windows depict the gymnasium to be a self-contained building, so
there shouldn't be any air ducts overhead.  {dh}

The exit doors shouldn't open in; in fact we could see the crash bars
the whole time.  {th}

It seems the store policy sign and "Cash" place mat are missing from the
Kwik-E-Mart.  {dh}

Just what is Leopold's job?  {ddg}

The tape reels were both full, reprising an error from "Bart Gets An
Elephant."  {th}

Bart pulls his drink glass out of thin air.  {dh}

The windows of the Springfield Laundromat change size.  {dh}

Bart doesn't actually walk into the Laundromat.  {dh}

The street drain disappears from front of the Laundromat.  {dh}

In 8F03, Skinner lives by himself.  {dh}

Skinner's hair looks much darker at night.  {ddg}

In the picture from Vietnam, Skinner's uniform doesn't have any rank
insignia, which should rate him as an E-1 (the lowest level of private,
although back in 1969, an E-2 had no insignia either -- note a Private
First Class, or "PFC", is an E-3); his current rank is E-7 (Sergeant
First Class -- "three up, two down", although there shouldn't be a
circle in the middle).  {ddg}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Tony Fafoglia: All in all an enjoyable episode not a great one.  B+.
    Could it be a self referential tribute to their 1st season perhaps!

Dan Saltzstein: Well, the new one was hilarious.  I remember watching
    the old one when it was on originally.  Let's not beat around the
    bush.  It sucked.  The new more satirical edge the show was
    developed is much more clever.  It was fun to watch, but not funny
    at all.  Did any else watch it in a room full of people?  No laughs
    at all.

Tony Hill: This episode had a lively, lilting plot with plenty of funny
    scenes.  Skinner and Bart together was a delightful story twist.
    The Italian restaurant scenes added a touch of whimsy.  SSSBAS is
    good enough for a B.

Matthew Kurth: I expected the 100th Episode to be a celebration.
    Instead, we had a funeral.  The script had no meaning, no depth, no
    punch, and no respect for good taste.  Bart and Seymour becoming
    fast friends was totally unbelievable.  What wasn't cringeworthy in
    this one was merely mediocre.  Pathetic and worthless.  Only Santa's
    Little Helper and Willie as the "greased Scotsman" saved it. 4/10.

Tom Parker: My 7 year old sat up half way through and said: "Dad, it's
    just not funny tonight."  Better fire the new writers and hire the
    old ones back, the Simpsons are in _real_ trouble and living on past
    glories.  Pains me to write it.

Don Del Grande: C...It started out as if it was shooting for "best
    episode of the season" (certainly the couch opening rates among the
    best), but after Skinner got fired, it just died.  The detergent bit
    in the laundromat had all the makings of a rake scene with different
    colored rakes.  And the ending was just "let's get Flanders out and
    Skinner in - Flanders is out - Skinner is in - roll the credits".

Ron Carter: [D+] All the 100th episode hype and this is what we get?  A
    hackneyed setup that leads to a warm and fuzzy "moral" ending?  Only
    redemption came from Willie, great as always; on the downside,
    everything else.

Yours Truly: Sort of fun, to be sure.  Nice blackboard _and_ couch gag
    (more evidence that "they _do_ read this group").  I thought
    Skinner's character was developed well here -- a big plus, almost
    hearkening back to Bart's development in "Bart Gets an F".  Ned as
    principal, though?  I give it a C.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> The Springfield Elementary gymnasium

Matthew Kurth says, "The gym in Springfield Elementary is woefully
    outdated -- the scoreboard doesn't have a clock, there are no three-
    point lines on the floor, and the overhead lights are reminiscent of
    lights installed in 1950s gyms."

>> Joey Heatherton and Sebastian Cabot

Tony Hill writes, "Joey Heatherton was an actor/singer, the daughter of
    comedian/ ventriloquist Ray Heatherton.  Later, she became a
    frequent guest on game shows.  Sebastian Cabot was a bearded British
    actor, although the explorer of the same name may have had a beard
    as well."

> Quotes and Scene Summary
===============================================================================
% [Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of
% Ricardo Lafaurie and Frederic Briere.]
%
% The scene opens a la "Wonder Years" with "With a Little Help from My
% Friends" being covered in the background.  A young Homer washes his
% muscle car with his fairly new girlfriend Marge.  He grins at the
% camera as Marge turns the hose on him, dousing him.  Homer has
% neglected to put the parking brake on in his car, it would seem: it
% rolls off the driveway and onto the street.
%
% In the next shot, it is Homer's birthday.  As Abe and Marge watch,
% bearded Homer opens Marge's present -- a book about beards.
% Delighted, he shows it to the camera, then leans forward to blow out
% the candles on his cake.  But his beard catches fire, and he runs back
% and forth in a panic while Marge worries and Abe laughs.

            [Bart watches a home movie of Homer's birthday]
      Bart: [laughs] They're going to eat this up at Show and Tell.
     Marge: I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the idea of your
            classmates laughing at our family's private moments.  How
            would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were
            laughing at things _you_ did?
      Bart: Not likely.  Come on, have a sense of humor about yourself!
             [the movie turns to baby Bart, naked, sitting on the
            toilet]
Young Bart: I'm a big boy today.
-- Maybe Mom _was_ right, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"

% Lisa laughs, and Bart sees reason.  He looks around for something else
% to take to school, and Marge suggests a largish potato.  "Mom, you're
% always trying to give me potatoes.  What is it with you?"  Marge
% explains, "I just think they're neat."  Bart runs up to Lisa's room.

Bart: I need something for Show and Tell.
Lisa: Just take one of my geodes.
       [Bart stares blankly]
      The rocks on my desk.
       [Bart goes over, picks up something]
      No, that's a trilobyte.
       [Bart picks up something else]
      That's petrified wood.
       [Bart picks up something else]
      Bart, that's a bran muffin!
-- No petrified birds, however, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss
    Song"

% Otto honks the bus horn outside, and Bart and Lisa walk out to it.  As
% Bart steps on the bus with his geode in hand, he notices everyone else
% has brought geodes, including Martin, who says, "Greetings, fellow
% geodologist!"  Bart groans, steps off the bus, and looks around for
% something else to take.  His eye falls on Santa's Little Helper; he
% tears the dog away from chewing up the morning paper.
%
% In class, {it is Nelson's turn at Show and Tell.}

  Nelson: {The ingredients were: fresh pureed tomatoes, water, salt, and
          sodium benzoate used to retard spoilage.  Once again, if I'm
          not mistaken, this can contained tomato paste.}
    Edna: {Thank you, Nelson.  I look forward to seeing it again next
          week.}  Bart, you're up.
           [Bart walks up as a cardboard box follows him]
    Bart: Boys and girls, Mrs. Krabappel, I come before you today to
          solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries: What
          has four legs and ticks?
Milhouse: A walking clock?
  Nelson: A walking clock!
  Martin: I'd wager he has some variety of walking clock in that box!
    Edna: Bart, is it a walking clock?
    Bart: [mystified] What?  No, it's my dog.
-- That was my next guess, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"

% Everyone gasps with delight.

    Edna: [looking at SLH] Oh, he is a gem!  Here boy.  [kisses] Would
          you like these cookies Martin made for me?
  Martin: My raisin roundies!
    Bart: My dog's name is Santa's Little Helper.  One time he crawled
          under the house and when he came out he was covered with ants.
          Then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water.
Everyone: Wow!
-- Amazing but true, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"

% Mrs. Krabappel thanks Bart: "Great job!"  Everyone cheers as he walks
% off.  "I knew the dog before he came to class," brags Milhouse.
%
% Martin walks up, places his geode on the floor, and narrates
% histrionically.

  Martin: Kaboom!  That, the sound of the thunderous volcanic explosion
          that gives birth to the magnificent geode, one of nature's
          most --
  Nelson: You're doing it wrong.  You gotta pet him hard so he can feel
          it.
           [he demonstrates; SLH sneezes]
  Sherri: Look, look, look!  The doggie sneezed.
    Edna: Hah!  It thinks it's people.
   Willy: [on the other side of the door] Hey, poochie!  Here, poochie,
          poochie, poochie!
  Martin: Ahem.  My geode must be acknowledged!
    Edna: [angrily] Oh, brother.  All right, back to Show and Tell!
          Bart, why don't you put the doggie away.
Everyone: Aw.
-- Short attention spans, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"

% Bart leads SLH to a closet and shuts the door on him.
%
% Later, SLH awakes to smell something good coming from the vent.  Lunch
% lady Doris' soup that day is particularly redolent, no doubt due to
% extra helping of horse testicles she's added to it.  "More testicles
% mean more iron!" she exclaims.  SLH can't resist, and he paws the vent
% open and crawls inside.  He crawls past the grade two room.

 Ralph: Um, Miss Hoover?  There's a dog in the vent.
Hoover: Ralph, remember the time you said Snagglepuss was outside?
 Ralph: He was going to the bathroom.
-- The boy who cried "dog", "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"

% Principal Skinner is on the phone in his office to the superintendent.

Skinner: [on the phone] I know Weinstein's parents were upset, uh,
         superintendent, but, but -- but I was _sure_ it was a phony
         excuse.  I mean, it sounds so made up: "yom kip pur".  [laughs
         sheepishly]
  Willy: [bursting in] Sir, you've got to come quick!  There's a dog
         running around in the air ducts.
Skinner: I understand.  [over PA] Children, this is Principal Skinner.
         Remain calm.  There is a dog in the vents.
          [In Bart's class, everyone cheers and gallavants]
-- That's not what he asked you to do, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's
    Baadasssss Song"

% Willy pushes Skinner's desk over to the corner of the room for Skinner
% to stand on.  He removes the vent cover and sticks his head into the
% vent.  SLH licks his face happily and wanders off.

Skinner: Willy, go into the vent and get him.
  Willy: What?  Have you gone waxy in your peaster?  I cannot fit in
         tha' wee vent, you croquet-playing mint muncher.
Skinner: Grease yourself up and go in, you...you guff-speaking work-
         slacker.
  Willy: Ooh, good comeback.
-- Indeed, "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"

% Willy approaches lunch lady Doris and asks her if they have any
% grease.  When she replies in the affirmative, he strips his shirt off
% and asks to be greased up.
%
% It really is a tight squeeze for him in the ventilation system.  He
% sees a flash of brown cross the T junction at the end of the shaft in
% front of him; behind him, at the other end, he sees another flash of
% brown shortly after.  Skinner monitors Willy's and SLH's flashing dot
% on a radar screen.  "Good Lord, it's coming up right behind him!"
%
% Although SLH has no malevolent intentions.  He simply licks Willy's
% foot repeatedly, but Willy is ticklish and begin laughing
% hysterically.  Several children are standing just under where he
% laughs, and they toss books and other things at the vent, denting the
% metal.  Willy implores them to stop.
%
% Skinner rushes out and orders everyone back to their room.  "Uh oh.
% Whenever I get this upset, I get hiccups!  (hic) Oh, right on cue..."
% he moans, and everyone points and laughs.
%
% Willy, meanwhile, has managed to orient himself so that he faces SLH,
% who runs away from him.  But the wily Scotsman manages to catch up and
% snag the stray mutt.

Willy: There's nary an animal alive that can outrun a greased Scotsman.
       Now, out we go --

 Chalmers: [voice rising] Skinner...!
  Skinner: Superintendent Chalmers!  You didn't have to come all the way
           down here.  Everything's under control.

 Chalmers: Seymour, you are in very, _very_ big trouble.
            [SLH falls into his arms]
           Why, looking into this lovable mutt's eyes just melts my
           heart.  Seymour, all is forgiven.
    Willy: [yells] Make way for Willy!  [lands on Chalmers] I said "Make
           way for Willy," you bloated gasbag.
 Chalmers: Seymour...
  Skinner: Hmm?
 Chalmers: You're fired!
            [Bart gasps]
  Skinner: I'm sorry, did...did you just call me a liar?
 Chalmers: No, I said you were fired.
  Skinner: Oh.  That's much worse.

% Next morning at breakfast, everyone but Bart eats their food noisily.

Bart: I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner got fired.  Now
      all I have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head.
Lisa: That's guilt.  You feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing
      a man his job.
Bart: I guess it is guilt.

% At Springfield Elementary, Chalmers has called an assembly.

Chalmers: Boys and girls, because of Mr. Skinner's sudden departure,
          I've had to appoint a new principal.  Leopold?
           [hulking Leopold stands, and everyone gasps in fear]
 Leopold: All right, you little punks: pick up your freakin' ears,

          -- with your new principal Ned Flanders!

     Ned: Well, tippety-top of the A.M. to every-good-body here.  As
          chairman of the PTA, I am de-diddley-lighted to take over here
          and I think I can put the "pal" back in "principal".
           [everyone laughs]
Chalmers: Heh heh, yeah.  And I'll put the "super" back in
          "superintendent".

          on, uh, lunch?
     Ned: Well, let me just say I want to put the "stew" back in

    Bart: [approaches him] Principal Skinner?  Um, I'm real sorry about
          my dog getting you fired, and biting you, and then getting it

 Skinner: Well...maybe it was for the best.  Now I...I finally have time
          to do what I've always wanted: write the great American novel.
          Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are
          brought to life through advanced cloning techniques.  I call
          it "Billy and the Cloneasaurus."

      cups, you seem to be getting in trouble every hour.
Bart: [through a full mouth] Must have been a coincidence.
 Ned: Uh, anyhoo, Bart, you're going to have to be punished.  This isn't

   Bart: Uh, I'll pass.  Hey, what's this?  [points to photo]
Skinner: Oh, that's my old unit from Vietnam.  I was their sergeant,

% Seymour and Bart go out to the backyard where Skinner, donning a

Skinner: [laughing hard] Ned Flanders actually eliminated detention and
         put the whole school on the honor system?
   Bart: [laughs] Yeah.  And the teachers are afraid to leave the

Skinner: [chuckles] Oh, ho ho, that place must be falling apart.  Oh,

% along with a colonel.

  Colonel: It's good to have another combat veteran around here.  I
           myself received a number of medals for, um, securing that

  Skinner: Hmm, yes, colonel.  Now I understand it will be my duty to

    Homer: [mouth full of peanut butter cups] Yes.  Deeply concerned.
      Ned: I may go a little easy on the old hickory-dickory stick, but
           that's just because my dad was hard on me when I was a boy.
            [flashback to New York City; a young Ned spills some ink]
Young Ned: Whoopsie doodle.
Ned's Dad: Oh, man!  Ned spelled ink all over my poems.  He's a real

   Homer: That is true.
    Bart: Here's the plan: once Chalmers comes for his next inspection
          and sees how crappy the school has gotten, he'll fire Ned on
