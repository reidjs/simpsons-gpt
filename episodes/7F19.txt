   ... when the twins nominate Bart, he was about to shoot a triangular paper

   ... the cracks in the wall of the Simpsons basement?  (And I have a

===============================================================================
Watch Lisa's mouth when she says the word `have' during her final scene
with Mr. Bergstrom.  She curls her lower lip into her mouth, and you can
see her teeth poking out from under her top lip.  This happens also when
Mr. Bergstrom says a word with the letter `v' in it, but it's more
noticeable with Lisa.

> Who was Sam Etic?
===============================================================================
From the 29 Apr 91 USA TODAY:

    MRS. ROBINSON:
    If you saw Fox's `The Simpsons' Thursday, you may have noticed a new voice
    in the credits---Sam Enid [sic].  Enid's voice sure sounded familiar,
    almost like Dustin Hoffman.  And gee, there sure were a lot of references
    in `The Simpsons' to Hoffman's first hit, `The Graduate', thrown into a
    story about Lisa falling into love with her substitute teacher.  Shazam!
    It turns out Enid is none other than Hoffman, whose contract with `The
    Simpsons' stated that his real name could not be used on the credits or in
    publicity.

===============================================================================
> Was this a `feel good' episode?
===============================================================================
Marc Colten (colten@cbnewsb.cb.att.com):

* Lisa found a truly good and wise teacher---and he left.

* She called her father a baboon and Bart agreed ("... I never thought _she'd_
  be the one to say it").

* Homer then goes "3 for 3".  How?
  - He acts like a baboon in front of his daughter.  She loves him, but she'll
    never respect him.  His attitude was that "Yeah, I'm a baboon, learn to
    live with it."
  - He then went to Bart and convinced him to aim low and be a jerk the rest
    of his life.  What an accomplishment.
  - Then he gives his baby daughter her pacifier.  Wow, what a father!

I don't think there's much to "feel good" about this episode.  As Lisa
observed in another episode [Dead Putting Society], she'll be telling all this
to a psychiatrist some day.

===============================================================================
Paul Kornreich (etzhadat@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu):

One of the important themes of this show was to respect people as they are and
not try to mold them into the ideal images that we want them to be.  The main
example is of course Lisa's need for understanding throughout the episode.
However, just as important, except slightly more hidden, is the fact that she
must accept her parents and brother as they are. This is evidenced by the
following additional scenes.

* Lisa notices Bart's classmates cheering him and makes some remark that you'll
  never fail by appealing to the lowest common denominator.  Mr. Bergstrom
  then, as well as assuring Lisa that she will one day be successful warns her
  that she will miss her brother.

* In my favorite scene in the laundry room, Lisa gushes about her crush on Mr.
  Bergstrom. She then tries to tell Marge that her love for Mr. Bergstrom is
  "different" (=> more real) than Marge's love for Homer.  Marge finally snaps
  at Lisa and tells her that if she expects Marge to understand her crush, she
  is going to have to accept the fact that Marge loves Homer.

* [re Homer's visit to Bart]  Assuming that Bart, like MG, is not stupid, but
  instead has an artistic bent Homer correctly surmised that Bart would not be
  happy with the responsibilities that class presidency brings.  His campaign
  was somewhat of a joke anyway.

* [re Homer's visit to Maggie]  If babies don't see something right in front of
  them, they sometimes think the object is gone. Maggie finds the pacifier
  necessary as she goes through teething.  On top of all this the room was
  dark, and she was probably groping for it.  The simple act (to us) of this
  restoration was a great relief to Maggie.

  In short (cliche and pun aside), the little things DO mean a lot.

===============================================================================
> Animation goofs
===============================================================================
When Lisa plays her sax, notice that the baseball diamond is pointing away
from the school building.  (A good idea.)  Unfortunately, there is no backstop
and there is a tree in left-center field.
===============================================================================
Mary Claire Pugh (pug2@ellis.uchicago.edu) and Merlyn LeRoy (merlyn@digibd.com)
were the first to point this out.

When Homer is in Lisa's room trying to cheer her up, Lisa's vanity has a
mirror with three photos taped to it (an elf, etc).  In most of the scenes,
the photos eclipse Homer when he is seen in the mirror, but at one point,
Homer is eclipsing the photos, as if the photos are not on the mirror but
on the wall behind him.

===============================================================================
% At 9:15am, while Lisa reads a book, her classmates are throwing things
% around the classroom.

1: Did you hear about Miss Hoover?
   She drank a bottle of drain cleaner by mistake.
2: Oh, I heard she fell down a well.
   [Principal Skinner comes in with Miss Hoover, who is crying]
Lisa:  My God, she's been dumped again...
-- ``Lisa's Substitute''

Miss Hoover: [shakily] Children, I won't be staying long.
             I just came from the doctor, and I have lyme disease.
             Principal Skinner will run the class until a substitute arrives.
Ralph:       What's lyme disease?
Pr. Skinner: I'll field that one.  [goes to blackboard]  Lyme disease
             is spread by small parasites called `ticks'.  [writes `TICKS'
             on blackboard]  When a diseased tick attaches itself to
             you, it begins sucking your blood...
Miss Hoover: [not calmed] Oh...
Pr. Skinner: Malignant spirochetes infect your bloodstream, eventually
             spreading to your spinal fluid and on into the brain.
Miss Hoover: The brain!?  Oh, dear God...
Class:       Wow!
-- ``Lisa's Substitute''

% was that Mr. Bergstrom appears Jewish, but there were no Jewish cowboys.
% Mr. Bergstrom rewards her with his hat, though he intended the third
% point to be that is was wearing a digital watch.

And, for the record, there were a few Jewish cowboys, ladies and gentlemen.
Big guys who were great shots and spent money freely.
-- Mr. Bergstrom's lesson on the American West, ``Lisa's Substitute''

% Mr. Bergstrom introduces himself and suggests ways the class could make
% fun of his name.  Ms. Krabappel begins the process of electing a class
% president, and she endorses Martin, who gives his nomination speech.

Martin: As your president, I would demand a science-fiction library,
        featuring an ABC of the over[something] genre.  Asimov,
        Bester, Clarke!
Student: What abouy Ray Bradbury?
Martin: [dismissing]  I'm aware of his work...

% During the cookie break, Mr. Bergstrom sings `Home on the Range'
% (with editorial commentary) to the class, and the kids pass to Lisa a
% picture of `the singing dork'.  Mr. Bergstrom catches Lisa with it.  She
% insists she didn't draw it, though that doesn't seem to bother him.  The
% kids then pass to her a picture of `the singing dorkette'.

% [End of Act One.  Time: 6:52]
%
% While helping Marge fold the laundry, Lisa gushes about her crush on

% cried when he read the end of Charlotte's Web.
%
% At school, Lisa's class is dismissed for lunch, and Mr. Bergstrom calls
% Lisa aside.

Mr. Bergstrom: Lisa, your homework is always so neat.

Lisa: No.  Homework's not my father's specialty.
-- ``Lisa's Substitute''

% Lisa is not very flattering in her description of Homer.  Meanwhile,
% the campaign for class president continues.

Martin: [campaign speech]  In a sample taken in this very classroom,

Bart:   That's not enough!  We demand MORE asbestos!
        [leads the class in a chant of `MORE ASBESTOS']
-- Martin and Bart run for class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''

% The campaign confrontation makes the front page of `The Daily Fourth Grader',
% headlined, ``Bart to Martin:  Eat my shorts!''

Bart:  Aw, Dad, it's just a popularity contest?
Homer: JUST a popularity contest?
       Excuse me.  What's more important than popularity?

% dismissed, Mr. Bergstrom mentions that the Springfield Museum of Natural
% History is closing due to lack of interest, and urges that they go see it
% while they can.  At home...

Marge: Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow,
       and I think you should take her.
Homer: Museum?  Tomorrow?  Oh, oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning
       on... [thinks to himself] Sleeping?  Eating a big sandwich?  Watching
       TV?  Spending time with the boy! [speaks up]  Spending time with the
       boy!  The boy needs attention, Marge.
Marge: Homer, I've been talking to Lisa, and I'm concerned about your
       relationship with her.
Bart:  Me too, Mom.  I think you're drifting apart.
Homer: Shut up, boy.
Marge: Homer, please.
Homer: Marge, you don't understand.  I can't do it because...
       [thinking to himself] You're trapped.  If you were smarter, you
       might think of something.  But you're not, so you just might as
       well... [speaks up]  All right, all right, I'll take her.
       [sotto voce]  Lousy brain.

Homer: Ooh, so it's up to me, is it?

Mr. B: I <am> giving her an A.
