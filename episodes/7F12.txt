When Artie Ziff arrived at the door, Patty/Selma says ``Don't we look
handsome.''  Although we hear only one voice, Patty's mouth moves for
the first two words, and Selma's for the last two.  Warner Losh suggests
this was intentional (and that we really heard two voices).

===============================================================================
> General comments
===============================================================================
Note that, since Homer was born in May 1955 (`Simpson and Delilah'), and
he graduated in the class of 1974 (`The Way We Was'), this means he was just
barely 19 years old at graduation.  Assuming he entered kindergarten at age
five, this means Homer had to repeat a year.

===============================================================================
Al Wesolowsky:

I enjoyed the reference to the Norman Rockwell painting of the young girl
looking a bit glumly at her reflection in the mirror, just before Homey
arrived to pick up Marge.

===============================================================================
> Shelbyville and the size of Springfield
===============================================================================
I asked:

Exhibit A:
  Artie: Woe unto Shelbyville, should they underestimate our strength
         in dramatic interpretation.

Exhibit B:
  Marge:  You KNEW the city forensics finals are tomorrow, and you
          kept me here until 1am pretending to be stupid?

What does this say about the size of the city of Springfield?

1.  It's big enough to have more than one high school.  (Springfield High
    and Shelbyville.)  Perhaps Shelbyville is a private school?

2.  It's big enough to have regions of town with their own names.
    (Shelbyville.)

3.  It's big enough that the writers goofed.

David Tamkin tries to explain:

Given that Shelbyville has its own baseball team in the same league as the
Springfield Isotopes (``Dancin' Homer'') and that the Shelbyville Orphanage
is in Shelbyville (``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''), we expected Shelbyville
to be a separate city.  Would a neighborhood of the city have a separate
baseball team while the other team in the same city called itself by the
entire city's name?  [Yes, I'm aware of the NL's former New York Giants and
Brooklyn Dodgers, but Brooklyn's relationship to the rest of New York City
can hardly be called a ``neighborhood''; it's more like a separate planet.
Let's consider that <both> teams were named for the boroughs they
represented, though I highly doubt that the Giants' home field was in
Manhattan.  ``Bronx Yankees''?  ``Queens Mets''?]

There being a Shelbyville Orphanage in Shelbyville doesn't require
Shelbyville to be a separate city.  Still, if it were part of Springfield,
wouldn't its director be familiar enough with the medical community to have
met Dr. Hibert or for someone far brighter and more observant than Homer to
have met them both and brought them together?

Consider these:

4.  Artie's ego was big enough that he assumed Springfield High would win the
    city forensics championship and go on to face Shelbyville in the regionals.
    (Shelbyville could have already clinched its spot.)

5.  Springfield High had two debate matches coming up: one for the city
    championship and one against Shelbyville High.  Neither was dependent on
    the outcome of the other.

6.  It's not unknown for a city to have a neighborhood with the same name as
    another municipality in the area.  (Here, Chicago has a Forestview and an
    East Chicago, while there are other towns named Forest View and East
    Chicago.  Morton Grove has a Prairie View, yet there is another suburb
    named Prairie View.  Meanwhile, my neighborhood has no name at all, and
    there are loads of suburbs whose names are so awful that they'd be better
    off without any.  And please don't ask me to detail how many different
    nearby areas are named ``Norwood Park.'')

7.  Same as #3.

John DeCarlo suggests that the `city forensics finals' invites
teams from outside the city.

===============================================================================
> Music
===============================================================================
jstahlhu@athena.mit.edu (Julie Kozaczka Stahlhut):

"Do the Hustle" was a minor anachronism.  In fact, so was "Pick Up
the Pieces" by the WAverage White Band.  That one came out in either
late '74 or some time in '75.

I thought the FUNNIEST musical joke in the whole show was the fact
that the theme of the prom was "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"!  Ever
listen to the words of that song?  It's about a really nasty breakup! 
As far as I could ever figure out, it's the story of a love-hate
relationship between an uneducated backwoods type and an obnoxious
upperclass social climber.  All set to very pretty slow-dance music,
of course; Elton John and Bernie Taupin's reputation for bubblegum
was never deserved.

===============================================================================
> Cars
===============================================================================

Homer's car:

David Moery: I think Homer drove a Duster, near as I can tell.  From the side
             it looked vaguely like a '70 or '71 Cutlass, but the taillights
             were definitely Duster-like.

Jym Dyer:    I wasn't too sure about Homer's car.  I thought it might have
             been a souped-up Maverick, but then again it might have been a
             Trans Am or somesuch.

Paul Masters: No, it was a '71 Cuda (or Charger).  Those were the days.

Andrew Roe:  I checked my tape again, and this time I agree that Homer's car
             was a Duster.  The taillights are wrong for a Torino.

John Kupec:  It was not a Duster or Torino!  Whoever posted that Homey's
             car was a 70-71 'Cuda was right.

Nick Rossi:  Certainly wasn't a Duster... I'm the proud owner of a Duster,
             and I would recognize it!

sgreene@sdcc13.ucsd.edu:
             It was definitely a Barracuda, or a Charger.  There is no doubt
             about it in my mind.  I have definitely seen enough of the
             vehicles to know it wasn't a Torino, and it was not a product of
             AMC at all.  Probably a Charger.

Marge's car:

David Moery, Robert J. Drabek, and Jym Dyer all agree:

            Marge definitely drove a Gremlin.
