> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   (United States) Having the same name as a bumbling TV character prompts a
   name change for Homer, whose impressive new moniker puts him on
   Springfield's "A" list.  Ed Begley, Jr. has a cameo.  {bjr}

   (Canada) Homer is the laughing stock of Springfield when a TV character
   bears both his name and d'oh-pey personality.  {hl}

Couch:          Marge brings a laundry basket to the living room, where a
                clothesline is strung in front of the couch.  She removes
                sheets from the basket, snaps them, and hangs them on the
                line, and we can see that the "sheets" really are Homer, Lisa,
                Bart, and Maggie.

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... the Springfield Shopper headline reading "IT'S WAR!", along with a
       picture of a nuclear explosion?

Cammie Brewer:
   ... Marge's fingers seemed a little shorter?  (maybe it's just my
       imagination)
   ... Lenny had a party at his house?  (remember "Realty Bites"?)

Ben Collins:
   ... Homer calls Maggie "the baby"?
   ... Marge doesn't like having her breasts grabbed, even by Homer?

Don Del Grande:
   ... the sign behind the judge says "Springfield Municiple Court" - and
       right when the judge tells Homer he's using the one name Homer spelled
       right?
   ... in Springfield, you can (apparently) change your name right away? (In
       California, it takes at least four weeks)
   ... when the trees knocked each other over, they managed to change
       directions?

Yuri Dieujuste:
   ... SNPP affects Albany's power supply?
   ... the attic has an unusually high ceiling for that type of house?
   ... OFF goes to the mall to go to the pharmacy?

Jordan Eisenberg:
   ... Homer looks like Dilbert with his tie thrown over his shoulder?
   ... we've had, quite possibly, the first nearly indisputable a.t.s.
       reference ever with CBG's "Worst Reading Ever?"
   ... that cactus in the board room was there from the start?
   ... "Costington's" no longer has the caption under their sign?

Todd Emerson:
   ... Clinton doing the lower-lip-bite thing while talking to Marge?

Joe Green:
   ... Carl's voice didn't sound right?

Darrel Jones:
   ... this is the first Season Ten episode to reuse a Season Ten couch gag?
   ... Homer carries a "Mid-Season" pennant?  [{je} asks, "where did Homer
       find a flag with the word "mid-season" printed on it?  (Maybe he wrote
       over his "football" flag from last week.)"]
   ... the stupid, sidekick "Homer Simpson" also has the same body build as
       Chief Wiggum?
   ... Marge has a tattoo somewhere on her privates?  (What a fox... ;)
   ... Homer's (er, Max's) "monogrammed" shirt actually says "Max Power"?
   ... the butler at the party chains himself to a tree?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Real Homer's scarf still has a price tag on it?

Haynes Lee:
   ... Yuppies smoking cigars?
   ... Quebec has the bomb?!

Patrick McGovern:
   ... Bill Clinton showed up in Springfield's cultural elite?
   ... Burns instantly remembered Homer as "Max Power", whereas he hasn't
       remembered him as "Homer Simpson" before?

Travis D. McLemore, Jr.:
   ... Springfield Shopper headline:  "It's War!"?
   ... Larry Davis and his band at the party?
   ... Homer/Max eating a fish like a watermelon?
   ... hippie-strength mace?

Paul Melnyk:
   ... Ned's different voice was a joke, but many of Hank Azaria's characters
       [also] sounded different?
   ... when they showed the people at the mall, couples seemed to be apart?
       (Jasper in between Mrs. + Dr. Hibbert, Nelson between Seymour and his
       mother?)

Mark A. Richey:
   ... Marge humming in the couch gag?
   ... Admiral Baby has a buck tooth?
   ... Homer wasn't shaven in the attic?
   ... Homer is wearing his monogrammed shirt from the kitchen scene onward?
   ... the eagle and dolphin topiary?
   ... the leaves trailing behind Ed Begley Jr.'s go-cart

Tom Rinschler:
   ... Homer/Max wears one of his embroidered shirts during the Thai food
       scene?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... the title of this episode is literally true, in that Homer becomes Max?

Gary Wilson:
   ... Homer has apparently taken back his job at the plant?  This is the
       first time we have seen him working there this season, as he quit in
       the series premiere.
   ... Grampa Simpsons story sounds like he might have been remembering the
       plot for the movie Gladys The Groovy Mule starring Troy McClure?  (It's
       a stretch -- a big one, but think about it.  He has seen "a lot of
       movies" and a story about a Mule saving spring break?)

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Rich Bunnell:  Not a -bad- episode, but as Simpsons episodes go, this was
   slightly average--it contained a slew of good jokes (such as Homer
   shrugging off Lorne Michaels and Homer's list of names in court) but when
   it comes down to it, it was just another "Homer has a dumb plan" episode.
   Also, what happened to Police Cops after the 2nd act?  And the "Hootie"
   joke at the end was disgusting and un-Simpsons like.  Still, as I said, for
   each bad point there's a good point (the absurd idea of a TV show with a
   baby commanding a ship), so this episode gets away with a  (B)

Ben Collins:  There's little to say about this episode.  The idea is
   interesting, and I like some of the meta-humor, but it's generally a ho-hum
   affair.  The Clinton gag isn't anything I haven't seen in Jay Leno's
   monologue.  An average effort for this season.  (C)

Nathan DeHoff:  "Homer to the Max" was the latest in a series of Simpsons
   episodes that are amusing in spots, but don't really go anywhere.  On the
   plus side, the television spoofs were done pretty well.  Homer's name
   change opening doors (including Burns remembering his name) was also
   somewhat clever (although similar to his new hair opening doors in "Simpson
   and Delilah").  The main problem seemed to be that there wasn't much of a
   plot, and what we did get was weak.  The majority of the show was just
   people hassling Homer, with no real developments until the name change.
   After that, it was okay for a while, but the whole tree-hugging scene was
   pretty stupid, and a little too close to the ending of the recent "D'oh-in'
   in the Wind."  (How many hippie jokes does one season need?)  (C-)

Don Del Grande:  Pretty good for an episode with a "separated subplot"
   (assuming you consider the "Homer Simpson" bit a subplot to the "Max
   Powers" bit), although I may be giving Swartzwelder the benefit of the
   doubt a little here  (B+)

Yuri Dieujuste:  Another mediocre episode from Season 10 that would never make
   it through Season 6.  The storyline was screwed up completely and there was
   a lack of funny jokes.  Also there was no theme that imitated our life.  My
   opinion is that the episode deserves a below average grade.  (D+)

Jordan Eisenberg:  Some funny stuff in there, like the mid-season replacement
   bits and Mr. Burns. And John Swartzwelder continues to come up with strange
   Rube-Goldberg-esque ways of furthering his stories, which I always love.
   The plot was a good concept, but what came of it was literally nothing more
   than a bunch of stuff that happened, with little conflict or an interesting
   story or anything.  The title describes basically this whole season, which
   is a shame.  Hopefully, since none of February's other episodes will
   revolve _directly_ around Homer, he'll fade into the background for a
   while.  (B-)

Alex Foley:  A funny, but weird episode.  For some reason I felt I was
   watching a different show.  But it was funny, even though the show took a
   dip in the 3rd act.  (B-)

Joe Green:  A very funny outing, even if it lost steam during the second act
   and the climax was a bit contrived.  I was surprised to see Ed Begley, Jr.
   poking fun not only at himself but at his pet cause.  All in all,
   Swartzwelder seems to have redeemed himself after the worthless horror that
   was "Homer Simpson in Kidney Trouble".  (B)

Darrel Jones:  An okay episode, I guess.  I didn't like Homer protesting the
   protestors, and there weren't many truly funny jokes (like the running
   cactus gag, the many meta-jokes, and the names Homer wanted to use), but I
   liked the premise and it didn't make me want to kill the production staff.
   Altogether, I'd give this one a 6/10.  (B-)

Joe Klemm:  Sadly, this episode, with the exception of the climatic chase
   between Homer and the cops, lacks the comedy that is usually found in an
   episode that centers around Homer's comical side.  The main plot idea of
   him getting a new name started too late, and most of the jokes weren't that
   funny.  (D)

Andrew Levine:  It's obvious the writers were trying, in the first act, to
   poke fun at our complaints that Homer's character has been drastically
   changed for the worse (stupider).  A memorable episode in the sense that
   Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie was a memorable episode.  I thought that there
   were funny parts (like the mule that saved spring break).  I really did not
   like the ending, though.  (B)

Patrick McGovern:  No, no!  That is NOT how one makes a Simpsons ep!  Easily
   the worst in recent memory.  The first act was pretty funny, the 2nd act
   was very boring, and the 3rd act was damn unfunny.  That "Max Power" stuffs
   makes me want to gag.  And what was with those Clinton jokes?  Or Ed Begley
   Jr.?  Not funny.  (F)

Paul Melnyk:  This episode had the rollycoaster feel.  It looked stupid with
   that Clinton stuff in the previews.  The first act was hilarious, it had
   pure Simpsons in it. It had some good jokes.  The Spaghetti-O's thing was a
   riot, so were the TV previews, also the part where Homer's flying on the
   fan, with the patron's ducking reactions, and of course, the
   noticed-on-second-viewing voice joke.  It seemed to get lame over the 2nd
   and 3rd acts though, providing some giggles with the episode references.
   The Clinton appearance was unfunny.  (B-)

Abhi Rey:  I was surprised cause I was expecting a lot less, but this episode
   was still a little below standard Simpsons.  Most of the humor was centered
   on meta-humor or network bashing, and I feel that it's starting to get
   really old.  The first half of the episode was uninteresting and aiming for
   a lower grade, but the second half really picked up and contained bold
   twists to the storyline.  The forest scene was a nice touch as well.  There
   wasn't much of a resolution to the episode though; just Max Powers changing
   back to Homer.  Overall, a decent episode.  (C+)

Tom Rinschler:  This episode was a hilarious satire and deconstruction of bout
   OFF and of television in general.  I was laughing my head of and enjoying
   every minute. Then the last ten minutes or so hit, and this episode sank
   like a rock. Rarely have I seen an episode that so completely and suddenly
   shifted from "good" to "bad" (the sharp cut off point was between the Burns
   and the monogram scenes).  The best thing I can say about the last act or
   so that it was a bit better than "The Principal and the Pauper" (mainly
   because it was shorter).  I was going to give this episode an A during the
   first part, but that rapidly disappeared as the third act progressed.  (C+)

Jason Rosenbaum:  Pure crap.  If there is a season next year, I will not watch
   it.  The writing was pathetic, the jokes were all repeated, and the Clinton
   joke was simply terrible.  Please, please, please, please end the Simpsons
   now.  (D-)

Gary Wilson:  What started out as a great parody of TV and some great self ref
   jokes turned in to a stupid plot about saving trees with a bunch of
   celebrities. Where the hell did that come from?  The clever plot just blew
   away in the wind.  I was hoping this would be the next I&S&P, a complete
   parallel to the show itself.  Then it had to get weird.  Really weird.  The
   plot just left me asking 'why?'  And another appearance of Clinton?  This
   is getting tiresome. Last weeks was within good fun, this weeks was just
   stupid.  And did anyone notice the abundance of dirty jokes?  Did Homer
   really say what I thought he did (you know what I'm talking about if he
   did.)  Oh well.  For the first half A, for the second D. What does that
   make?  (C)

Yours Truly:  I'm a sucker for a good meta-joke, and this episode had lots of
   them.  It also had quite of few jokes of the regular kind, making it more
   than just a one-trick pony.  The last act wandered off-topic; I think the
   story would have been stronger (and the ending less rushed) if they had
   stayed on one point.  In spite of this structure problem, this was still a
   good show.  (A-)

>> I won't tell them about my what?

Ellen Cohen explains Bart's blackboard punishment:  Sciatica is a form of
   lower back injury. Stereotypically you hear elderly people complaining
   about their sciatica, because it's a fairly common injury.  You also hear
   about it a lot at the chiropractor's office (my chiropractor had a sciatica
   pamphlet that showed a middle-aged man holding his lower back as he
   struggled to get out of an easy chair).

   Merriam-Webster's definition of "sciatica":

   sci*at*i*ca (noun)

   [Middle English, from Medieval Latin, from Late Latin, feminine of
   sciaticus]

   First appeared 14th Century

   : pain along the course of a sciatic nerve esp. in the back of the thigh;
   broadly : pain in the lower back, buttocks, hips, or adjacent parts


>> Behind the TV scenes

 - Mid-season excitement

Joe Klemm explains the mid-season phenomenon:  Referred to in the TV business
   as the Second Season, the mid-season in the television season usually airs
   new shows that replace the season starter shows that flop and are cancelled
   after a few weeks.  Some of the best shows to air on TV actually started in
   the middle of the season.  Among those shows, along with the Simpsons,
   include America's Funniest Home Videos and All In the Family, which were
   both spoofed at the beginning.


 - Pilots

Joe Klemm, again:  Sometimes, a television show's pilot is different than the
   other episodes that air after that.  Among the changes that are usually
   made after a pilot includes cast changes and introduction to other regular
   characters.  Meanwhile other pilots, like I Love Lucy and the Brady Bunch,
   are filmed way before the show is picked up, thus the characters may look
   younger than they first appeared.


>> "All in the Family, 1999"

Mark Aaron Richey:  another midseason replacement (this one in 1971), the
   original AITF was a controversial, but very popular sitcom about a bigoted
   man and his conflicts with his liberal son-in-law.  Very controversial for
   the time (hell, it would be even more controversial if it was premiering
   now), it nevertheless was the highest rated series for five straight years.
   The "revival" looks to be a very watered down version with Carroll
   O'Connor's Archie Bunker reduced to a lovable figure (as far as I know,
   O'Connor has no money problems).


>> Police Car Watch

Benjamin Robinson:  Lance and "Homer" pull up to the crime scene in something
   that looks like a Corvette.  The roofline looked a little screwy, although
   that could just be the angle from which we saw the car.


John M. Daniel suggests it may have been a different car:  I thought it was
   supposed to be a Ferrari Daytona... another reference to Miami Vice, where
   Sonny Crockett drove a Daytona (actually for filming the show they used a
   slightly doctored Vette) until he got a late-model Testarossa.


Benjamin Robinson responds:  I think the headlight/turn signal shape was wrong
   for a Daytona.  The dash seemed Daytona-like in a vague sort of way. By the
   way, wasn't Crockett's Daytona a Spyder?  The "Police Cops" car was a
   hardtop.


>> And you thought it was just for ambience

Patrick M. Geahan explains why Moe's ceiling fan might be turning in winter:
   This isn't horribly uncommon for two reasons.  First, in a bar, or any
   other crowded place, it probably gets damn hot at times.  Second, on most
   ceiling fans you can change the direction of the fan.  This is supposed to
   keep the hot air, which would rise, circulating through the room.


>> Max Speed

If you need proof that "Simpsons" fans scrutinize the show closely, then
   here's some excellent evidence from "jibberuski@aol.com":  When Homer walks
   into the cactus the first time, the frame rate is 30 frames per second.
   This was the first time I have seen this on The Simpsons.  The usual rate
   is 24 or 12.

   A TV's speed is 30 frames per second, so it can't go faster than that.  TV
   shows generally use 24 frames per second since that is what movie cameras
   use. When this is done, every fourth frame is repeated.  You can tell if
   this is done by watching it in slow motion.


Todd Emerson replies:  Well, as Max himself said, "There are three ways of
   doing things: the right way, the wrong way, and the Max Power way!"  (Which
   is the wrong way, but faster!)


>> Mace gets in my eyes

Alan Hamilton explains the mace-swabbing reference:  The pepper spray bit is a
   clear reference to an incident that happened in 1997.  Environmental
   protestors went to the office of then-Congressman Frank Riggs (R-
   California 1) to protest the congressman's pro-logging position.  [{ah}
   says another group was chained up at the offices of Pacific Lumber
   Company.]  When the protestors refused to leave, Riggs' security officers
   applied liquid pepper spray on their eyes.  The protestors sued, insisting
   it was "cruel and unusual punishment".  Riggs stood firmly by his officers,
   who won a victory in the California State Supreme Court.  The whole story
   got national attention, and public response to the security men's actions
   (including in Riggs' district, which runs along California's north coast)
   was mixed.


>> Meta-reference corner

It's a festival of meta-references!

   The "second season", the time when the networks launch the shows to replace
   the shows they launch in September.  Now stretching from October to April,
   most replacement series get dumped by May (anyone remember last spring's
   "The Closer"?  How about "House Rules"?). However, a surpassing number of
   replacements catch on.  Among the replacements currently on the air are
   "The Practice", "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "Just Shoot Me", "NewsRadio",
   "3rd Rock From the Sun", "Dawson's Creek", "Homicide: Life on the Street",
   "Walker, Texas Ranger", "King of the Hill", and yes, OFF.  {mar}  [{ol}
   adds, "The Tracey Ullman Show, which ultimately launched Simpsons in the
   first place, was also a mid-season series on a mid-season network.]

   Homer says networks like animation because they don't have to pay the
   actors, referring to pay dispute the network and the actors had last
   summer.  {bjr}

   Just then, Ned walks by mentions that voice actors can be replaced without
   anyone noticing.  (Evidently he didn't catch on to the fact that his own
   voice had completely changed.)  During the pay dispute Fox threatened to
   hire replacement actors.  This strategy collapsed when the voice actor
   community, in a remarkable show of solidarity, told Fox to go jump in a
   lake.  {bjr}  [{mar} notes the actors secured big raises, to boot.  Also,
   see "[?]"]

   Lenny asks Homer to "act stupid, like you do on TV."  That one shouldn't be
   too hard to get.  {bjr}

   A character named "Homer Simpson" becomes dumber as the series runs longer.
   That one shouldn't be too hard to get, either.  {bjr}

   Lisa consoles Homer by saying producers often change some characters and
   push others to the background.  As though to emphasize her point, Mr. Largo
   and the Capital City goofball stroll by the kitchen window.  (Don't the
   Simpsons mind people trespassing on their property?)  {bjr}  [{nd} notes,
   "The Goofball was somewhat of an odd choice for this gag, since he was
   never really a major character."]

   On "Police Cops," Homer Simpson is the comic relief, just as on another
   show I'm familiar with.  {bjr}

   Homer tells the mall crowd that they've confused him with a "fictional
   character on TV."  {bjr}

   Wiggum identifies Homer as "the stupid cop from TV."  You ought to know,
   Chief.  {bjr}

   The Comic Book Guy wants an audio recording of Homer saying his catch-
   phrase.  In real life, Dan Castellaneta and Yeardley Smith have both done
   answering-machine recordings.  (Mr. Castellaneta's wound up on the radio,
   Ms. Smith's are just for her friends.)  This could also be a comment on how
   the Internet fans want audio files of just about everyone on the show.
   {bjr}

   Comic Book Guy deems Homer's reading as the "worst ever," although at least
   this time he may be right.  {bjr}

   Krusty tells Homer, "Once they get a taste of you, they want more."  A
   couple years back, people were clamoring for more of "our" Homer.  (Be
   careful of what you ask for...)  {bjr}

   Marge tells her husband, "Your growing insanity is starting to worry me,"
   which echoes this newsgroups concern about Homer's increasingly loutish
   behavior.  (Ironically, in this show Homer acted more like his usual self.)
   {bjr}


>> Maybe they =can= replace the actors, after all

Nicolás Di Candia explains why foreign-language viewers get to the tell the
   diddely-ifference whether they want to or not:  The English version of "The
   Simpsons" does not, fortunately, suffer that common practice in cartoons.
   But foreign versions do. The Spanish version that I believe is dubbed in
   Mexico gets new voices for almost all the minor characters in each episode.
   They even changed Bart's voice beginning with "Bart Carny". Plus, the
   dubbing actors do not "act" the lines, they just read them (I am beginning
   to think that that's why I disliked some episodes last season). There are
   no two episodes, for instance, in which Lionel Hutz has the same voice.
   And, intrestingly, Poochie's voice in 4F12 was (obviously) Homer's, but in
   AABF01 it was COMPLETELY different!

   Another thing that keeps happening is that the names of the characters vary
   (Dr. Nick is now called Dr. Sables).


>> What's in a name?

A number of brand-name celebrities were seen or mentioned on tonight's show.
   Here's some quick background

   Anthony Michael Hall:  Former member of the Brat Pack who briefly rose to
   stardom in the mid 80's thanks to roles in "National Lampoon's Vacation",
   "The Breakfast Club", "Sixteen Candles", and "Weird Science".
   Unfortunately, his career soon nose-dived (starring in drek like "Johnny Be
   Good" didn't help), and his most recent appearances have been in such films
   as "The Grave", "Exit in Red", and "Trojan War" (yes, I've never heard of
   them either).  {mar}

   A.M. Hall was also a cast member on Saturday Night Live during the 1985-86
   season when Lorne Michaels returned as executive producer of the show.
   Also on the writing staff of SNL that season - AABFO9 writer John
   Swartzwelder.  (BTW, Swartzwelder's fellow Simpsons writer George Meyer was
   also an SNL writer that season)  Given the jokes made at the expense of
   Hall and Michaels in this episode, one guesses that they may not have been
   Swartzwelder's favorite co-workers.  In any event, this bit of trivia can
   be added to the vast number of in-jokes that made this episode enjoyable.
   {tc}

   Marlon Brando:  Heavyweight (in every sense of the term) actor.  He was the
   head honcho of a bizarre compound in "Apocalypse Now," and not the comic
   relief, unless you have a really dark sense of humor.  {bjr}

   I'm not sure what movie Marge was watching, but Brando's appearance in this
   deeply dark 1979 film from Francis Ford Coppela was most certainly not
   comic relief.  Brando played Colonel Kurtz, the highly decorated, and
   highly insane, military leader who had become the ruthless ruler of a group
   of Vietnam natives.  His scenes were among the darkest in the film (maybe
   she confused Brando with Dennis Hopper, who played a drugged-out
   photojournalist who stayed at the compound.  He provided the few light
   moments during the last twenty minutes of the film).  {mar}

   Annie Potts:  Comic actress who has been on a number of cancelled shows,
   including "Love & War" and "Dangerous Minds."  She looks a little like the
   lady smoking a cigar at the garden party, although that isn't her.  {bjr}

   Potts is the former star of "Designing Women" who, since the end of that
   series, has starred in several disappointing shows, "Over the Top",
   "Dangerous Minds", and currently, Lifetime's "Any Day Now".  {mar}

   Jeremy Piven:  Known for the recently-cancelled "Ellen," where he was
   Ellen's cousin, and the soon-to-be cancelled "Cupid" (ABC's giving it the
   ax right before Valentine's Day).  [{al} points out he was also in "Grosse
   Pointe Blank" -- Ed.]  {bjr}

   Jeremy Piven is one of the crew members who unexpectedly had to jump ship
   from a TV series, struggling to find a lifeboat elsewhere on primetime.  He
   played Ellen's cousin Spence on ABC's "Ellen" and joined the show around
   1995.  Now he has a new show on ABC that was actually picked up for
   midseason called "Cupid."  Being the forgettable cog of an actor he is,
   it's no surprise Homer nor the executives would know who he is.  {ol}

   Piven has been in a lot of roles on both TV ("The Larry Sanders Show",
   "Ellen", "Cupid") and the movies ("Grosse Pointe Blank", "Very Bad
   Things"), and has a very recognizable face, but his name is not as well
   known (Homer would probably know him if he saw him).  {mar}

   Woody Harrelson: Harrelson is a committed environmentalist, as well as
   committed to the legalization of industrial hemp (the plant that marijuana
   is derived from), and is often seen in public wearing clothing made from
   hemp.  {mar}  [{bjr} adds, "The pro-hemp forces claim the fiber can be used
   for practical things, like clothing in addition to its, ahem, recreational
   value."]

   Slight correction: although industrial hemp and the version grown for
   marijuana are technically the same species (Cannabis sativa), industrial
   hemp cannot be used to make the drug.  Similarly, although the Chihuahua
   and the Rottweiler are very different in appearance, temperament, and
   almost everything else, they are both the same species, Canis familiaris.
   {bc}

   Ed Begley, Jr.:  The only famous person whose voice appears in this
   episode, Mr. Begley is noted for his work on "St. Elsewhere," and with the
   environment.  He strongly supports solar power research, hence his little
   demonstration with the pinwheel.  {bjr}  [{mar} adds, "He starred in 'St.
   Elsewhere' during the 80's, and even was briefly a leading man in the
   movies.  Lately, however, he has been content to guest star on TV shows,
   and make straight-to-video films."]

   Ellen Cohen adds, I saw something about him on cable.  He drives an
   electric car, has a solar-powered house, and recycles everything into a
   compost heap or recycling center except used tissues!  :Þ  Dennis Miller
   once commented in a stand-up act, "I'm happier than Ed Begley Jr. driving
   to the recycling center in an electric car with a bag full of empties!"  Or
   something to that effect.  {bjr}

   President Bill Clinton:  Okay, you don't really need me to tell you who he
   is.  I just thought it was funny that the writers featured him prominently
   in this episode, while last week [for "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday (AABF08)"]
   they weren't certain he'd still be in the White House.  Good thing the GOP
   impeachment trial bogged down, or the writers would be up @#*$! Creek
   without a paddle.  {bjr}

   Lorne Michaels:  Producer of "Saturday Night Live," a show that isn't as
   hip as it was eight years ago.  If Mr. Michaels wanted to impress his
   fellow partygoers, he might have mentioned his involvement with "Late Night
   with Conan O'Brien."  {bjr}

   George Stephanapolous [sic]:  He isn't mentioned by name, but Clinton's
   aide looks like him.  He was Clinton's press secretary, but quit several
   years ago.  I guess the animators don't know what his replacement looks
   like.  {bjr}


>> Contribution for a rained-out ballgame

Andrew Gill has an interesting story:  Well, seeing as I don't have much more
   STUFF for this episode, I might as well add something tangentially related

   <http://www.milk.com/wall-o-shame/koch_is_it.html>

   A man named Fred Koch changed his name a few years ago, to reflect the
   correct pronunciation of his name.  Unfortunately, Coca-Cola didn't
   appreciate the fact that Mr. ``Coke Is It'' was infringing on their
   trademark.  I'm not sure of how the subsequent court case turned out.


>> Tattoo You

Benjamin Robinson:  Marge has a tattoo of Homer's name?  It beats me as to
   where -- we saw just about everything there was to see of her in "Natural
   Born Kisser (5F18)," and I certainly didn't notice any body art.  This
   might explain why she was so dead set against Bart getting a tattoo,
   though.


>> He who steals my purse steals trash, but he who steals my name ...

Ondre Lombard explores Homer's legal options to regain his name:  If Homer
   wanted to sue for having his name used without his permission, he could
   have a lawyer motion to have it taken to trial, depending on if opposing
   counsel moves to challenge the claim.  In any case, Homer would likely lose
   if he didn't have a good lawyer, since no show doesn't include a page with
   the copyright credits that explicitly stipulates that All persons and
   events depicted are fictional, and any similarities to persons living or
   dead is purely coincidental.  However, if Homer decided that he had
   evidence that the character was indeed based upon him (such as with the
   scene of "Homer" pleading for dignity), he would have a case.


>> As though being named "Homer" wasn't difficult enough

Benjamin Robinson:  Turnabout is fair play.  Homer has the misfortune of
   sharing a name with a dumb TV character.  Here in the real world, there are
   people who can sympathize with his plight, since they are named Marge,
   Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and yes, Homer Simpson.  "TV Guide" did a story
   featuring some of these people in 1991, shortly after the series moved to
   Thursday.  This universe's Homer is a seventy-something guy (or he was in
   1991) who fielded a lot of prank calls asking for the "other" Homer.
   Incidentally, he said the number of calls dropped after Fox moved the show
   to Thursdays, suggesting the ratings may have taken a hit.

   Also at about this time, a man named Bart Simpson ran for office in Texas.
   His opponent accused him of capitalizing on his newly famous name, which
   was probably a well-founded charge.  No matter, as it turned out Bart
   Simpson couldn't win an election in this universe, either.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Homer Power Ranger


Jordan Eisenberg's Alterna-alterna-title:  "'Power' is a Pow-Pow-Powerful
   Name"


Don Del Grande:  How many Simpsons characters have been voiced by two (or
   more) different actors?  The ones I can think of are Lurleen Lumpkin, Mrs.
   Glick, and Roger Meyers, Jr.


Yuri Dieujuste:  George Stephonopolus is a former advisor to President
   Clinton.  He is now a professor at Columbia University and a political
   advisor to ABC News.


Gary Wilson writes about "All In the Family 1999":  This version appears to
   have been "political corrected" for a modern audience.  In the real show,
   Archie Bunker was predigest against pretty much everyone slightly different
   than him.  This type of character probably wouldn't sit easy on Network TV
   now a days.


>> And now, for a =really= personal note

Andrew Gill ventures into ... "The Twilight Zone":  Does this family sound
   familiar?  Three kids, the older two separated by 8 years, while the
   younger two are separated by 2 years.  The younger two are the same gender,
   and the older sister (a psychologist) has a middle name of Marie.  The
   older brother has a middle initial J. That's right, it's my family!

   Now, there's one more similarity: my father's name is Max, which is not
   short for anything.

   Coincidence?  I think...so.

% Homer might be horrified, but the new "Homer Simpson" is a big hit
% with the bar crowd.  They ask Homer to do something dumb, like on TV.

Homer:    Shut up!  I'm not your clown!  Don't diminish me!  Gentlemen,
          I bid you fare ...  [tosses his scarf, which gets snagged in
          the blades of a ceiling fan] Ooh!
          [Homer, hanging from the fan, screaming, is getting a lot of
          laughs.  Finally, the scarf gives way, and he flies out the
          door and into the street in front of Moe's]
          Ow!  Ohh!
Lenny:    Jeez, what an exit!
Carl:     Oh, man, what's he gonna do for an encore?
Moe:      [looking outside] Whoo ... I don't think he'll be doin' no
          encores for a while.  Hah, hah!  Hah!

% On a bright Springfield morning, Homer can only stare at the bacon
% and eggs on the plate in front of him.

Homer:    I don't understand what happened.  Why did they change Homer
          Simpson's character from cool to stupid?
Lisa:     The first episode was just a pilot, Dad.  Producers fiddle
          with shows all the time!  They change characters, drop
          others, and push some into the background.  [while Lisa
          talks, Mr. Largo and the Capital City Goofball stroll by the
          Simpsons' window]
Marge:    Your character provides the comic relief!  Like, oh ...
          Marlon Brando in "Apocalypse Now".
Homer:    Wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these.
          [Homer pulls the scarf off his neck and tosses it onto a pile
          of boxes next to the refrigerator labeled "scarves"]
-- "Homer to the Max"

% At the power plant, Homer sits at his station, trying to do his job.
% His co-workers have gathered in a nearby hallway to watch him.

Lenny:    [whispering] Get ready, everybody.  He's about to do
          something stupid.
Homer:    Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to
          have me confused with a character in a fictional show.  Now,
          if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about ...  [spills a
          fondue pot, which had been resting on the control panel]
          D'oh!
          [an alarm sounds, and the crowd watching him laughs.  On a
          map of the U.S., the state of New York blinks and an alarm
          buzzes]
Lenny:    [laughing] There goes Albany!
Carl:     [laughing] Uh, oh, Spaghetti-O's!
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Things are even worse for Homer at the Springfield Mall; Homer is
% watched and laughed at by people lining the walkways.

Homer:    People are laughing at me, Marge.  Let's get outta here!
          Forget the baby's medicine!
Marge:    But her forehead's on fire!
Homer:    Fine.  I'll be in the car.  Driving home.
Wiggum:   Well, if it isn't that stupid cop from TV.  [scratches his
          ear with his gun barrel] Oh yeah, that got it.
-- One stupid TV cop to another, "Homer to the Max"

% More people come up to stare, including the comic nerd.

Comic Book Guy:     Your catchphrase is hysterical.  Please say it
                    clearly for my answering machine tape.  [hits
                    "record"]
Homer:              [unenthusiastic] Uh, oh, Spaghetti-O's.
Comic Book Guy:     Worst reading ever.
-- Don't worry, no one ever calls you anyway, "Homer to the Max"

% Despite Homer's lackluster reading, his fans continue to crowd him.

Fan #1:   How about an autograph?
Fan #2:   Picture, mister?
Frink:    Can I shine your shoes?
Homer:    Come on, people!  Enough is enough!
Krusty:   [taking Homer aside] Ah, it's never enough.  Not for them!
          Once they get a taste of you, they want more, and more, and
          more!  That reminds me, you mind if my nephew kicks you in
          the belly?
Homer:    Okay ...
          [some big red-headed teenager comes up and lays his foot into
          Homer's stomach, knocking Homer to the mat]
Krusty:   Oh, the flash didn't go off!  Got another one in you, Josh?
          [Josh nods]
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Later, Homer has resigned himself to the attic, to sit in a rocking
% chair and watch the world from a window.  Marge, carrying a tray of
% food, stops at the edge of the attic hatch to watch him.

Homer:    The whole town's laughing at me.  Even that cat out there!
          Bart, kill that cat!
Bart:     [shouting, from elsewhere] Okay!
Homer:    And that big yellow flower!
Marge:    [walking up] Homer, your growing insanity is starting to
          worry me.  Why don't you talk to the producers of the show?
          Maybe they'll make your character suave again.
Homer:    Hmm ... I guess I could.  But while I'm gone, keep an eye on
          that weird-looking kid down there.
Marge:    Bart?
Homer:    Yeah.  [makes air-quotes] "Bart."
-- "Homer to the Max"

% At "By The Numbers Productions", Homer walks into a building painted
% with the characters of "Police Cops".  Inside, he sits down on the
% opposite end of a table from thirteen grim-faced studio execs.

Homer:         Uh ... so, I just wanna know how come you made your
               Homer Simpson character so ...
Producer #1:   Stupid?  [laughs] Well, I can assure you, it happened
               organically.
Homer:         It better have!
Producer #1:   The thirteen of us began with a singular vision --
               "Titanic" meets "Frasier".
Producer #2:   But then we found out that ABC had a similar project in
               development with Annie Potts and Jeremy Piven.
Homer:         Who's Jeremy Piven?
Producer #3:   We don't know.
Producer #4:   But it scared the hell out of us, so we slapped together
               a cop show instead.
Homer:         Police Cops.
Producer #5:   Uh, no, actually, it was called "Badge Patrol".
Producer #1:   But the network idiots didn't want a show about high-
               tech badges that shoot laser beams!
Producer #2:   So we asked ourselves, "Who's behind the badge?"
Producer #3:   Police ...
Producer #4:   Cops ...
Producer #5:   "Police Cops."
Homer:         Yeah, but why does the Homer Simpson character have to
               be so stupid?
Producer #1:   Oh, he's not stupid.  He's a street-smart fish-out-of-
               water in a world he never made!
Homer:         I'm begging you!  I'm a human being!  Let me have my
               dignity back!
               [the Producers nod at Homer; he gets up and walks off,
               face-first into a cactus]
               D'oh!
-- Leading by example, "Homer to the Max"

% On next week's show, the Homer Simpson character's coat is caught on
% top of a flagpole.  "Let me down, Chief," he begs, "I'm beggin' you!
% I'm a human being, let me have my dignity back!"
%
% The ball on top of the flagpole finally breaks, and Homer Simpson
% falls, crotch-first, onto a cactus below, for a big sure-fire chuckle.
% That's the last straw for Homer.  He goes to make his case in the
% courts.

Homer:    Your honor?  I'd like to sue the producers of "Police Cops"
          for twenty million dollars for improper use of my name.
Judge:    Court finds in favor of "Police Cops".  Next case.
Homer:    [shuffles papers] Then I'd like to legally change my name!
Judge:    What name would you prefer?
Homer:    Any of these will be fine.
Judge:    Hmm.  "Hercules Rockefeller".  "Rembrandt Q. Einstein".
          "Handsome B. Wonderful".  Huh, I'm going to give you the only
          name you spelt correctly.  From this day forward, your name
          shall be ...
          [cut to a shot of Lisa, reading from a sheet of paper on the
          Simpsons' couch]
Lisa:     "Max Power"?
Homer:    Dynamic, isn't it?
Bart:     I love it, Max.
Marge:    You changed your name without consulting me?
Homer:    That's the way Max Power is, Marge.  Decisive.
          Uncompromising!  And rude!
Abe:      Oh, wait a minute.  The family name is my legacy to you.  I
          got it from my father, and he got it from his father, and he
          traded a mule for it!  And that mule went on to save Spring
          Break!
-- Then thanks for New Orleans last year, mule, "Homer to the Max"

% Marge has some reservations about her husband's new name.

Marge:    But this will be so confusing!  The mailman won't know what
          to do.  Did you think of the mailman at all before you did
          this?
Homer:    Yes, briefly.
Marge:    And what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?
Homer:    Oh, Honey, they have acids that can burn that off.
Marge:    But I fell in love with Homer Simpson!  I don't want to
          snuggle with "Max Power"!
Homer:    Nobody snuggles with Max Power.  You strap yourself in and
          feel the "G"s!
Marge:    Oh, Lord.
Homer:    And it doesn't stop in the bedroom.  Oh, no.  I'm taking
          charge!  Kids, there's three ways to do things.  The right
          way, the wrong way, and the Max Power way!
Bart:     Isn't that the wrong way?
Homer:    Yeah, but faster!
          [turning and walks face-first into a giant cactus]
Lisa:     We should really put that in the corner.
-- That was pretty fast, though, "Homer to the Max"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  11:46]
%
% Homer sits at his station at the nuclear plant, singing a song about
% his new name.

Homer:    [singing] Max Power, he's the man who's name you'd love to
          touch!  But you mustn't touch!  His name sounds good in your
          ear, but when you say it, you mustn't fear!  'Cause his name
          can be said by anyone!
Burns:    Ah!  Max Power!  How's every little thing?
Homer:    You remembered my name!
Burns:    Well, who could forget the name of a magnetic individual like
          you?  Keep up the good work, Max!
Homer:    Mr. Power.
Burns:    Yes, of course.  Mr. Power.

% At Costington's, Homer shops for something to complete his dashing
% new image.

Homer:         So I want the monogram to read "M-A-X P-O-W ... "
Employee:      Sir, traditionally, a monogram is just initials.
Homer:         Max Power doesn't abbreviate.  Each letter is as
               important as the one that preceded it.  Maybe more
               important!  No, as important.
Employee:      [sighing] Very well.
Homer:         And if you've got enough room, add some exclamation
               points and a pirate flag.
Trent:         [walking up] The man knows what he likes.
Homer:         Just taking care of business.
Trent:         If you don't, who will, huh?  Trent Steele.
Homer:         Homer Si ... uh, Max Power.
Trent:         Oh, hey!  Great name!
Homer:         Yeah, isn't it?  I got it off a hair dryer.
Trent:         [laughs] I like a man who can poke fun at himself.
               [looks at his watch] Ooh, hey, my one o'clock cancelled.
               Eh, you had any lunch?
Homer:         Yeah, but I usually have three or four.
Trent:         So where to eat?  You like Thai?
Homer:         Tie good.  You like shirt?
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Homer, returning home in a monogrammed blue shirt, drops a few bags
% of food from "Thai Palace" on the table.

Homer:    Marge, this is Thai food.  From now on, I want it morning,

Marge:    When did you start liking Thai food?
Homer:    When Trent Steele bought me some.
Marge:    Who's Trent Steele?
Homer:    He's Max Power's oldest and dearest friend.
Lisa:     What's this wrapped in a banana leaf?  [sniffs] Mmmm, smells
          like mint!
Homer:    Oh, I spit my gum in there.
Lisa:     Ew.  [drops leaf on table]
Marge:    Where'd you meet this Trent Steele?  Moe's?
Homer:    No way, he's a winner.  He has a company that makes
          computers, or, a computer that makes companies.  Anyway, you
          wouldn't understand.
Marge:    Well, I guess your new name is really opening doors for you.
Homer:    For all of us.  Look!
Marge:    [reading] You are invited to a garden party this Saturday.
Homer:    This is our chance to rub elbows with Springfield's young,

Marge:    Mmmm ...
-- "Homer to the Max"

% A few days later, Homer and Marge drive up to a beautiful home in

% number is spelled out.  Homer hands his keys to the valet, who is
% aghast at having to park such an antiquated ride.
%
% Inside the beautiful garden where the party is held, Homer and Marge

Marge:    Oh, look, it's Woody Harrelson!
Man:      [to Woody, laughing] I can't believe those pants are made

          [Woody's pants look like a bunch of pot leaves sewn together]
Marge:    And there's Ed Begley, Jr.!

Homer:    So I said, "If this is the House of Pancakes, how come I
          can't eat the walls?
Trent:    Oh, you are too much, Max.
Guest:    I thought I knew all the players in Springfield.  Where have
          you been hiding yourself?
Homer:    Well, I spent a lot of time on the couch.
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Elsewhere, Marge dances with President Clinton.

Clinton:  I know you don't think you're good enough for me.  But
          believe me, you are.  Hell, I done it with pigs.  [laughs]
          Real, no-foolin' pigs!
Marge:    Are you sure it's a federal law that I have to dance with
          you?
Clinton:  You know, I'd change that law if I could, Marge.  But, I
          can't.
Aide:     [whispers in Clintons' ear]
Clinton:  Aw, shoot.  Quebec's got the bomb!  Well, I gotta go, but ...
          look, if you're ever near the White House, there's a tool
          shed out back.  I'm in there most of the day.
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Trent taps his glass with a spoon and steps on a chair.

Trent:    Attention, please, attention.  Um, I just wanna say how
          thrilled I am with this turnout.  I'm proud to share my home
          with Springfield's best and brightest.
Homer:    [eating a raw fish] Hey, no problem.
Trent:    We've all been blessed with privilege and success.
Homer:    Whoo!  Privilege!  [twirls fish in the air]
Trent:    Uh ... but with privilege comes grave responsibility.
Homer:    [spitting out fish] What?
Trent:    We all have to give something back to the world that's been
          so good to us.
Homer:    Give something back?  Boo!  Get a haircut!
Trent:    I'm talking, of course, about our endangered forests.  [crowd
          members talk with each other in agreement] We have to protect
          them, because trees can't protect themselves, except, of
          course, the Mexican Fighting Trees.
Homer:    Could somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up?
Trent:    Can we let the wanton destruction of our nation's forests
          continue?
Crowd:    No!
Trent:    If a tree falls in the forest, will you make a sound?
Crowd:    Yes!
Trent:    To the protest bus!
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Marge and Homer, not really enthusiastic about getting on the bus,
% are pushed on by the crowd of Springfield elite.  Trent, not sensing
% their reluctance, tells them they're going on a trip to save a stand of

% shouts out the window at Ed Begley, Jr.

Marge:    Aren't you coming, Ed?
Begley:   I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth.  It's a go-

          [Begley attaches a wired-helmet to his head and quickly
          drives off]
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Later, Homer, Marge, and the rest of the party-goers have themselves
% chained to trees.

Homer:    Oh, this is the worst party ever!
Marge:    I don't know.  Remember that New Year's Eve at Lenny's?  He
          didn't even have a clock.
Homer:    Oh, Marge, I thought it would be fun to be on Springfield's
          "A" list.  But these people are nuts!
Marge:    You can't blame them for having a social conscience.
Homer:    Sure you can.  Bunch of no-good do-gooders.
Begley:   Hang in there, Max.  Saving the environment is a hard,
          grueling job.
Homer:    That's what I'm saying!  See Marge, this guy gets it.
-- At least somebody there does, "Homer to the Max"

% Chief Wiggum pulls his car up next to the redwoods, alongside a few
% idle bulldozers and their operators.

Wiggum:   All right, what's going on here?
Begley:   We can't allow you to destroy these beautiful trees, which
          have the same rights you have!
Wiggum:   Man, I have really had it with you tree-huggers.
Homer:    [laughs] Tree-huggers!
Wiggum:   Something funny, nature boy?
Homer:    No.  I just thought it was cute when you called him ...
Wiggum:   All right, "Max Power".  Eddie!  Swab this joker's eyes with
          mace.
Marge:    Swab?  I thought it was a spray?
Wiggum:   Okay, she's second!
-- "Homer to the Max"

% Eddie dips a long cotton swab into a jar of Hippie-Strength Mace and
% brings it toward Homer's eyes.  Trent tells Homer not to give Wiggum
% the satisfaction of screaming.  Homer doesn't even plan on giving
% Wiggum the satisfaction of being swabbed with mace, however.  He starts
% running circles around the tree, trying to escape.  Eddie chases him.
% Providing backup, Lou joins in the chase, but runs directly behind
% Eddie in the same direction.

Lou:      Eh, you better call for back-up, Chief.
Homer:    Just leave me alone!  Go swab Begley!  He likes it!
Eddie:    Slow down, punk!
-- "Homer to the Max"

% While running around the tree so many times, the chain around Homer's
% waist has dug into the flesh of the tree so far it falls.  As it goes,
% it takes other trees out like dominoes.  Yelling "I'm free!", Homer
% tosses his chain into the air, knocking a bald eagle out of the air.
% As trees begin falling, crushing what's left of the entire forest, one
% falls on Wiggum's police car, which was just two days away from
% retirement.
%
% When the dust clears, there's nothing left of the forest except for
% some logs on the ground and Springfield's elite crawling out of the
% ruins.  As Trent surveys the damage, Homer sheepishly asks where the
% party bus is headed next.  He is met with angry glares.
%
% Sometime later, Homer lies in bed with Marge.

Marge:    Well, I'm glad you changed your name back to Homer Simpson.
Homer:    Yes, I learned you gotta be yourself.  Good night, honey.
Marge:    Good night.
          [Homer flips off the lamp, but then flips it back on]
Homer:    Oh, I almost forgot.  While I was at the courthouse I had
          them change your name.
Marge:    To what?
Homer:    Chesty La Rue.
Marge:    Chesty La Rue?!
Homer:    Just try it for two weeks!  If you're not completely
          satisfied, you can be Busty St. Claire.
Marge:    I don't want to be Chesty La Rue, or Busty St. Claire!
Homer:    Fine, Hootie McBoob it is.
Marge:    Good night, Homer.
          [Marge reaches over and turns off the lamp]
Homer:    Sleep tight, Hootie.
Marge:    Let go of those!
