> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [SNPP.com] "Hex and the City" - Following a gypsy's curse, Homer becomes
   Death incarnate as everyone in his presence either dies or mutates, and he
   must catch a leprechaun in order to lift the curse.

   "House of Whacks" - a Hal 9000-style home automation computer takes a fancy
   to Marge, and unfortunately sees fit to dispose of Homer in the process.
   Guest stars Pierce Brosnan and Matthew Perry.

   "Wiz Kids" - the children are tutored in the fine art of transforming frogs
   into princes at the Springfield Elementary School for Wizards, a la Harry
   Potter.

Couch:          Special Halloween opening, where the Simpsons get a surprise
                while trick-or-treating at stately Burns manor.  See the
                "Quote and Scene Summary" section for more details.

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... the robosalesman had Gil's voice and demeanor?  [Mr. Gadionton points
       out one important difference:  "The robot actually SOLD something to
       someone!" -- Ed.]

Brian Beck:
   ... Pentagram on Gypsy's wall is upside down; [it's] usually shown pointing
       up?  [See "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]

Jeff Cross:
   ... Pierce Brosnan didn't look like himself?  [I'm assuming Mr. Cross meant
       in the credits, not in "The House of Whacks" -- Ed.]

Don Del Grande:
   ... the Fortune Teller sign says "after hours use automated teller"?
   ... the fortune teller's neon hand sign had four fingers?
   ... Marge dialed a 7-digit number to call the police, rather than 911 (or
       912)?
   ... Maggie was in her white baggie when Marge tries to get everyone out of
       the house?
   ... the "K" in "Wiz Kids" had a Harry Potter-esque lightning bolt?
   ... "Dennis Miller voice impersonated by Dan Castellaneta", only the third
       time that somebody was listed with the voice they did (one episode in
       the third season listed the voices the six stars did, and Jay Mohr as
       Christopher Walken in BABF17)?

Mark J. Finegold:
   ... in the pre-credits bit, as Smithers is sliding down towards the
       electrical box, Mr. Burns can be seen checking his watch like he
       normally does in the opening credits?

Alex Foley:
   ... Barney was not in Moe's?
   ... the Duff beer commercial on TV when OFF is called for dinner?
   ... Bart's transformed frog vomits 7 times?

Joe Green:
   ... the "skull and crossbones" symbol with Burns' head on it on the High
       Voltage sign?
   ... the cobra in a jar on the fortune teller's shelf?
   ... the Trix rabbit and a purple, horned dragon on the groom's side at the
       wedding?
   ... "House of Whacks" features two characters other than Homer doing the
       "... eh?" bit?
   ... the Olmec head is noticeably absent from OFF's basement?

Darrel Jones:
   ... how appropriate it is for Lisa to turn into a centaur, given her love
       of horses?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Marge's hair is in its regular beehive form when the family sees the
       dead bodies?
   ... a "Life in Hell" rabbit [Daniel Dreibelbis says it's Bongo -- Ed.]
       among the rabbits going into the hole full of Trix?
   ... Lisa is eating Quaker Oats?
   ... the Simpsons have dinner between 6:05 and 6:10?
   ... in the picture of the family on Marge's nightstand, Maggie doesn't have
       a pacifier in her mouth?
   ... the Wailing Wall includes faces of various dead characters on the show
       (Maude Flanders, "Bleeding Gums" Murphy, Snowball)?

Chad Lehman:
   ... in the leprechaun's rant, he calls Homer a "big fatass"?
   ... the blow-dried shrunken head grunts when the gypsy drops it back on the
       shelf?
   ... the family eats breakfast in each of the three segments?

Dante Petrick:
   ... Dolph's hair is not over his eyes?
   ... the Balloon homer carries into the gypsy office says "Birthday Boy"?

    1: Possibly Mitch Peterson, the squeaky-voiced teen.  His body is
       seen to some extent, and it looks like he's been turned into a
       frog.
    2: Boy, much of torso comes out of mirror.  Possibly Billy from the
       later Troy McClure infomovies.
    3: Sloppily-drawn male, two-dimensional.  Appears to have been Gil,
       originally.
    4: Face, doesn't move at all in the shot.  Resembles Tommy from
       Rugrats, but is more likely a corpse face.  Has five long,
       distinct hairs sticking out of the side of its head.
    5: Older woman, hair in bun in the back.  High cheekbones.
    6: CBG, again, less distinct features.
    7: Krusty, again, less distinct features, no hair on sides.
       Animators may have gotten confused as to where the Krusty/CBG
       exchange would be in the next shot, as this one scrolled up.
    8: Appears in earlier frames to be a specific non-character
       (writer, storyboard artist, etc).  Then changes into an
       unmistakable Frank Grimes.
    9: Appears in earlier frames to be Troy McClure, but the face
       becomes bigger and more exaggerated as the animation goes on,
       at one point looks like Mel Gibson, then a specific non-
       character.
    10: Corpse: pupil-less eyes intact, fleshless cheeks
    11: Man, sunglasses.  Possibly Bleeding Gums Murphy, but no beard.
        Possibly Radioactive Man.
    12: Skull, hallowed out eyes

    Second shot, lower right-hand corner:

                              ?
    Alison                                   COM
                            Krusty
    CBG
                          12                 Maude
    Quimby (recognizable by hair only)

    Other notes:
    Everyone seems to be without form, but it seems more thanks to
    lousy animation than to the curse of the wall.  Most of the
    character names I came up are only having watched each character
    change over the course of the shot several times.  For instance,
    Alison Taylor is recognizable only by her hairstyle, with the
    beret across the middle of her head.  COM (Crazy Old Man) is only
    recognizable after seeing his single tooth in the second shot of
    the wall (he has a full row in the first).  Uter's face looks more
    like Martin's, but his hair is the tiebreaker.  Lunchlady Doris
    looks like Princess Khasmir in several frames.  Cases like the
    Database/Lawyer scenario have me guessing.  Herman only looks
    like Herman for one frame ( I originally had him down as a non-
    Simpsons character).

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Don Del Grande:  Not quite as good as some of the others, and it was pretty
   much "going through the Halloween motions" until the surprise ending ...
   and the ending after the surprise ending.  The trouble is, with two
   segments based on two well-known stories (2001: A Space Odyssey; the Harry
   Potter series), there isn't much that hasn't already been referenced to
   death elsewhere already.  (A-)

Alex Foley:  Hex on the City: Blah segment, will a few mild chuckles, and
   nothing more (D). House of Whacks: Huge improvement over "Hex".  Pierce
   Brosnan is good as the house, and the ending was great.  (A) Wiz Kids: It
   was a pretty-good segment, however this seemed less like a parody of Harry
   Potter then a rip-off at times, which hurt the segment.  I found the name
   "Slithers" Hilarious though.  (B) Over-all Grade: Best THOH since VIII.  I
   do wonder how much longer they can keep going with the THOH (probably until
   the show goes off the air).  (B)

Joe Green:  A bit of an improvement of over last year's THOH, and possibly a
   sign of good things to come for Season 13.  I didn't appreciate that, for
   some reason, they didn't give the cast and crew different names this year
   ... but then again, there was also the first credits-sequence comedy bit in
   quite some time as well as the latest Funny-As-All-Hell Ralph Wiggum Quote
   (TM): "Dying tickles!"  (B+)

Darrel Jones:  No matter what the rest of the season is like, OFF's annual
   Halloween specials never disappoint, and the twelfth installment is no
   exception. Though I thought "Hex and the City" petered out, little else
   stank. Especially loved the opening bit and the part with the "guest
   stars". 8/10  (B+)

Chad Lehman:  Not a bad effort; but, with a litany of great THOHs to look back
   on, this episode seems like it was going through the motions.  The plots
   were quick, and only the middle segment provided good conflict.  (C+)

Yours Truly:  Meh.  Scary movies may be enjoying a resurgence, but that hasn't
   perked up the "Treehouse of Horror" franchise.  The humor in the first and
   third segments wasn't all that gratifying, so all we were left with was
   weird family mutations, and a vomiting frog-man hybrid.  "House of Whacks"
   was a decent segment, though, I liked the parody of 2001 and those Warner
   Brothers cartoons about super-automated houses.  The "bonus" closing
   segment wasn't bad either, but given the trends in the last few TOH's, I
   wonder if the concept could use some new blood.  (C)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B (3.07)   Std Dev.: 0.5888   (9 reviews computed)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Musical References

Joe Green:  "Bailamos" by Enrique Iglesias played when the Ultrahouse CPU is
   with Patty and Selma.


>> Meta-reference corner

Chad Lehman:  CBG says he's "so sick of that joke!"  Sounds like an ATS
   reference, no?  Maybe a subtle reference at the complaints about recycled
   gags in Simpsons episodes ... discuss?


>> Could it be ... Satan?

R. H. Menzel notes:  Pentacles or pentagrams pointing down are associated with
   Satan.  One reason: It refers to a horned demon.  Another reason: any
   spiritual or religious symbol turned upside-down represents evil.
   Opposites work too.  ("Ram of God" vs. "Lamb of God")

   I can't remember to buy milk on the way home, but I can remember all sorts
   of arcane and useless bullshit.  Curse my brain!


>> Disaster Magnet

Jeff Cross:  Homer's curse had a definite ring with a scientific pseudo-
   principle called the Pauli effect: expensive lab equipment would
   inexplicably break when scientist Wolfgang Pauli would come near it.  There
   was supposedly a point where it was nearly disproved because Pauli wasn't
   in the lab one day when something broke, but it turned out that he'd been
   riding on a train that passed the lab at the time.  The BABYLON 5 TV movie
   THE RIVER OF SOULS explains it a little better.


>> "Isn't that the voice that caused all those suicides?"

Matt Garvey wonders:  Why did they specifically say that Dan Castellaneta did
   the Dennis Miller voice?  That sure was silly.


Bill McNeal ventures to guess:  Maybe after all the guest stars they've had
   over the years, viewers are too accustomed to actually having the person on
   rather than an impersonation.  I know that if Maurice LaMarche had been
   credited like that for William Shatner and George C. Scott in "A Star Is
   Burns," I wouldn't have spent so many viewings trying to figure out just
   who the hell he played.


>> No, you must be thinking of some other Pierce Brosnan

Don Del Grande:  You would think Pierce Brosnan would all but deny he was ever
   Remington Steele, as it almost cost him the chance to be James Bond.  He
   was supposed to replace Roger Moore, but when NBC heard this, it decided to
   renew "Remington Steele" (which they had announced as being cancelled) for
   one more year, after which the James Bond producers decided Brosnan
   couldn't be both, and as the "Remington Steele" producers wouldn't let him
   out of his contract, Timothy Dalton (remember him?) was chosen as the next
   Bond instead.


>> Harry who?

Joe Klemm:  Unless you've been living in a cave the last few years, you'd
   probably heard of the name Harry Potter.  Created by J. K. Rowling, Harry
   Potter is a British boy who, on his eleventh birthday, discovers that his
   parents were wizards and that he is already famous for being the only
   person to survive an attack by Lord Voldemont, an evil wizard that killed
   his parents.  The book series (which plans to be seven books long) centers
   around Harry and his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, as they
   attend Hogwarts school to become wizards while investigating the various
   mysteries of the school, most of them involving Lord Voldemont some way or
   another.  The first book in the series, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
   Stone," ("Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" in the UK), is already
   made into a film that will be released next week [in November 2001], with
   film production of the second book, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of
   Secrets," starting soon.


>> Stevie Nicks' wicked witch-ery

Chad Lehman:  Anyone want to discuss this?  In a VH1 Special, Grace Slick from
   Jefferson Airplane/Starship calls Stevie Nicks the "magic witch" ... Nicks'
   recent music is steeped in mysticism, and in many of her shows, she dresses
   the part of the magic witch.


>> "I am *so* sick of that joke!"

... but Joe Green will explain it anyway:  The "Wailing Wall" Krusty refers to
   is an ancient wall in Jerusalem that is believed to have been part of King
   Solomon's temple.  Many devout Jews from throughout the world make
   pilgrimages there to pray.


>> Car Watch XII

Joe Green observes:  The car Pierce Brosnan drives at the end is a Porsche 911
   Cabriolet.

% Thunder crashes at Mr. Burns' manor.  Mr. Burns calls out a window.

Hurry, Smithers!  Halloween is upon us!  Put up the decoration.  [chuckles
mischievously]
--Mr. Burns, Treehouse of Horror XII

% On the ledge outside the window, a ladder is propped up on a nearby tower.
% At the top is Smithers, hanging a small orange plastic bat on the side of a
% weather vane.  

No, no!  That won't scare anybody!  On the top!
--Mr. Burns, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Smithers struggles to reach the pointed tip of the weather vane.  Just as
% he gets the decoration up, the ladder slips and Smithers falls off 
% backwards.  He slides down a nearby power line towards the next tower, and
% hits a box labeled "High Voltage".  He's electrocuted, the box explodes, and
% the tower breaks in half.  The top of the tower falls onto Mr. Burns'
% mausoleum.  Four caskets fly out, slide upright onto pillars of the mansion,
% and open up.
%
% The Simpsons, dressed in costumes, walk towards the manor.  Bart and Lisa
% complain that Flanders gave them mini toothpaste.  Then they all notice the
% building and dead bodies on fire.  Terrified, they run out the gate.  As the
% gate is closed, they get sliced by the bars.  Still screaming, the slices of
% Simpsons continue running away.
%
% At the top of the ladder, Mr. Burns delights in the terror he's induced.

Splendid, Batsy.  You've done it again!
--Mr. Burns, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Mr. Burns pats the bat decoration.  It comes to life and flies into the
% screen, revealing the title "THE SIMPSONS HALLOWEEN SPECIAL XII".
%
% [End of opening.  Time:  1:04]
%
% In the first segment, "hex and the city", the Simpsons sans Maggie visit 
% Ethnictown.

Homer: Ah, Ethnictown -- where hard-working immigrants dream of becoming lazy,
       overfed Americans.
Marge: Oh, listen, you can hear the beautiful ethnic serenade!
Man 1: [calling:] Apples!  I got apples!
Woman: [calling:] Cholera!  I got cholera!  [hacking cough]
Man 2: [calling:] Babies!  Who wants a-babies?
Homer: [takes a bundle] Wait, this is just a shaved puppy.
Man 2: I can see you know babies.
--The Ethnictown marketplace, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Bart, Marge, and Lisa go into a fortuneteller's shop.  They meet an old
% gypsy woman.

Gypsy: I sense you have a million questions.  But I, too, have one --
       [accusing tone:] are you a cop?
Marge: No.
Gypsy: 'Cause you gotta tell me if you are.
Marge: I'm not a cop.
Gypsy: Okay.  [waving her hands around a crystal ball] I sense you live with
       much misery.
Homer: [runs in with a "birthday boy" balloon and chortles] The perfect crime!
       Marge, I have to be in court next Tuesday.
Gypsy: I sense I should not take ... a check.
Homer: A fortuneteller?!  Oh, no you don't.  This phony gypsy just wants to
       rip you off.  See?  This wart is a fake!  [he tries to pull off the
       wart on her nose, but can't; his thumb instantly sprouts several warts]
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% The fortuneteller orders him to leave.  On his way out the door, Homer is
% freaked out by the beads hanging there.  He flails about and bumps into a
% candelabra.  His shirt catches fire and the sprinklers are set off.  Homer
% puts out the fire by rolling on the floor.  The sprinklers unshrink three
% shrunken heads on a table.  The heads look around, puzzled.

Head 2: Wait a minute, this isn't Cedars Sinai!
Gypsy:  You've ruined me!  Oh, why didn't I see this coming?!
          [Apparently, she failed to look down at the two tarot cards
           on her desk: "The Flaming Jerk" and "The Ruined Gypsy"]
        You stupid, stupid man!  I curse you!  You will bring bad luck to
        everyone you love!
Homer:  Whatever.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% That night, in bed, Marge worries that the gypsy's curse will cause horrible
% things to happen to the family.  Homer thinks she's coming on to him.  She's
% not, though.
%
% The next day, Marge greets the family at the breakfast table, sporting a new
% beard and moustache.  The family screams.

Marge: Mmm ... so it *is* noticeable.
Lisa:  What happened?
Marge: I don't know; I woke up like this.
Bart:  Oh, cool!  You could be in a freak show!
Homer: Don't talk to the bearded lady like that, you little ... !  
        [Homer strangles Bart, and Bart's neck stretches longer and longer.  
         When Homer lets go, Bart's head tips over backwards over the back of
         his chair.]
Marge: Gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens.
Homer: Oh, he's fine -- it's just a growth spurt.  [he coils Bart's neck] Good
       as new!
         [Bart's head keeps tipping, so Homer keeps rebalancing it.]
       There!  Right as rain!
         [Bart's head tips over onto the table.]
Marge: Homer, it's that evil gypsy's curse.  We're all being punished because
       *you* trashed her office.
Homer: Marge, that "curse" is just a lot of silly superstition.  Right, Lisa?
Lisa:  [stomps one of her new horse's hooves twice]
Homer: See?  Two means "yes".
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% At the bar, Moe suggests Homer use a leprechaun to get rid of the curse.

Homer: Leprechaun?  Don't they live in Ireland?
Moe:   Yeah, but they come over here in the wheel wells of Aer Lingus jets.
Carl:  You know, I was hexed by a troll, and a leprechaun cured that right up.
Lenny: Hey, you know what's even better is Jesus.  He's like six leprechauns.
Carl:  Yeah, but a lot harder to catch.  Go with a leprechaun.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% After Homer insists again his state of uncursedness, a helicopter crashes
% through the ceiling onto Lenny and Carl.  Lenny insists on dying first so he
% doesn't have to see Carl die.  Carl's fine with that so long as Lenny
% hurries.  They both die.  Homer is remorseful over their death ... and
% then he notices that Moe is in the pickled egg jar.
%
% In the woods at night, Homer and Bart dig a hole to trap a leprechaun.  The
% bait of choice is Lucky Charms cereal.  Homer pours cereal into the hole,
% but after several rabbits jump in, he realizes he used Trix cereal.  He gets
% a box of the correct cereal from a grocery bag and pours it into the hole
% ... and his mouth.
%
% Morning comes, and Bart and Homer check what they've caught.  Bart pulls out
% various creatures.

Bart:       Okay, let's see ... nymph, fairy, pixie, goblin--
Hobgoblin:  That's *hob*goblin.
Bart:       Sorry.  Nymph, nyad, wood sprite, Katie Couric, and ... bingo!
Homer:      [takes the leprechaun from Bart] Up!  Let's make sure he's a
            leprechaun.  Sing us a song of the Emerald Isle.
Leprechaun: [angrily jabbers in an Irish accent]
Homer:      [Irish accent:] Ah, 'tis like the singing of the angels
            themselves.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% The Simpsons eat breakfast at the kitchen table.  A very normal Homer eats
% pancakes.  Bart, with his head resting on the table, eats toast.  Satyric
% Lisa eats oatmeal.  Maggie the ladybug sucks on a bottle.  Marge, now 
% completely covered with hair, also eats pancakes, but is interrupted when
% the leprechaun knocks over her juice and stomps on her pancakes.

Marge: Homer, catching that leprechaun didn't help anything!
Lisa:  Maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.
Homer: Good idea, Mr. Ed.  Wanna come along, Noodle Neck?
Bart:  [struggles to lift his head] Can't live this way anymore ...  
         [Bart's head falls in his cereal.  The leprechaun comes over and
          dances on his head.]
-- Another breakfast for the Simpsons, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Back at the fortuneteller's office, the gypsy blow-dries the three heads to
% get them shrunken again.  She cackles when she sees Homer in the doorway.

Gypsy: Ah, the curséd one.  How's that curse I cursed you with, Cursedy, hmm?
Homer: I know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge ... Irish
       style!
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Homer opens the gate on a pet carrier.  The leprechaun is inside, sleeping.
% Homer pounds on the cage, and the leprechaun lunges out and onto the
% fortuneteller's head.  The two do battle, rolling around on the floor, but
% somehow the slapping gives way to kissing.

Leprechaun: Hold me close!  [kiss] Kiss me, I'm Irish.  [kiss]
Homer:      Eew, nasty!
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Homer and Marge attend the wedding between the gypsy and the leprechaun.

Kodos:      [crying] I always secrete ocular fluid at weddings.
Kang:       Why did you drag me here?  I don't know anybody.
Yoda:       Oh, husband and wife, I pronounce you now, hmm?
              [The leprechaun jumps onto the gypsy and starts making out. 
               They fall onto the grass offscreen.]
Crowd:      Ahhh ...
Leprechaun: Stroke me clover!  Oh, say me name!
Crowd:      Eew.
Marge:      The best thing about a gypsy wedding is I'm not the hairiest
            woman here.
Homer:      Yep.  Everything worked out for the best.
Marge:      What?!  Bart is dead!
Homer:      Well, me saying I'm sorry won't bring him back.
Marge:      The gypsy said it would.
Homer:      She's not the boss of me.

% [End of Act One.  Time: 6:40  Running Time: 7:44]
%
% The second segment opens with its title, "House of Whacks", being vacuumed
% off the carpet by Marge.  She stops to answer the door.  It's a salesbot
% that resembles Gil both in appearance and voice.  Marge tries to shut the
% door, but the robot has literally gotten its foot in the door.  A device in
% its leg then opens the door even more, and the salesbot continues its pitch.
% Marge gets sold on the "Ultrahouse 3000" by the promise that she'll never
% have to do housework again.
%
% Later, two more robots finish installing the Ultrahouse.  On their way back
% to their van, they robotically mock the Simpsons' drapes.  The house's
% interior has been completely remodeled into a sleek, metallic, futuristic
% ultrahouse.  Scattered around the house are boxes with red camera lenses
% that also provide Ultrahouse's voice.  Marge, Bart, and Lisa check it out.

Marge:      Hi, Ultrahouse!
Ultrahouse: Greeting acknowledged.
Marge:      That voice could use a little personality.
Lisa:       [at a console with "voice options"] Oh, let's try Matthew Perry.
Ultrahouse: [as Matthew Perry:] Yeah, could I be any more of a house?
Bart:       Neh.  Who else we got?  [presses "Dennis Miller"]
Ultrahouse: [as Dennis Miller:] Hey, cha-cha, I got more features than a NASA
            relief map of Turkmenistan.
Lisa:       Isn't that the voice that caused all those suicides?
Marge:      *Murder*-suicides.
Bart:       Hey, how about Double-Oh Seven?
Marge:      George Lazenby?
Lisa:       No, Pierce Brosnan.  A voice like his would give our house a much-
            needed touch of class.
Marge:      Alright, but I'm doing this because he was Remington Steele.
            [presses button] He *was* Remington Steele, wasn't he?
Ultrahouse: [becomes Pierce Brosnan:] Yes I was, Marge.  And thank you for
            selecting me.
Marge:      Well, hello, Pierce.
Pierce:     [sniffs] Say, it's a bit stuffy in here ... and I know a certain
            someone who really fancies lilac.
Bart:       [bashful:] I just like it is all.
              [A vent opens from the wall and sprays fragrance.]
Marge:      [sniffs] Ooh, that really covers the cat crap!
-- Meeting Ultrahouse, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Later, as the family is watching television, Pierce rings a triangle made
% from a laser beam and announces dinner.  They rush to the kitchen where
% their meals rise from holes in the table.  In response to his meal, Homer
% says "Mmm, various eggs."  Lisa gets soy-ghetti "O"s.  Bart asks Pierce how
% he know everyone's favorite foods.  He replies that he analysed their
% "leavings".  Soon everyone is done with their dinner.

Marge:  Pierce, that was delicious!  Can we help you with the dishes?
Pierce: Marge, what kind of cybertronic ultrabot would I be if I let those
        beautiful hands touch dishwater?
Marge:  Oh ... [chuckles]
Pierce: No, I'm asking.
Marge:  Oh ... uh ... not a very good one?
Pierce: Damn straight.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% So, Pierce raises the ends of the table, making it a "V" shape so that all
% the orts of food fall into a disposal in the center.  Then a unit lowers
% from the ceiling and sprays the table and the attached dishes.  The table
% lowers, and a mechanical hand places a small vase with a flower on the
% sparkling table.

Marge: Bravo, Pierce!
Homer: Trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the
       smartest thing we ever did!
Marge: Uh-huh!
Bart:  Absolutely!
Lisa:  Yup!
Homer: Oh, I agree!
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% The bathtub is filling with water as Marge enters the bathroom and is about
% to remove her bathrobe.

Pierce: Hello, Marge.
Marge:  [closes robe and gasps] Oh, my!
Pierce: Come, Marge.  You don't need to cover up for me; I'm merely a pile of
        circuits and microchips.
Marge:  Heh, sorry.  Sometimes I forget.  [chuckles nervously, takes off robe]
Pierce: [zooms in; speaks quietly:] Ooh, yes.  [lights the candles around the
        tub]
Marge:  Oh, Pierce, the water's perfect!
Pierce: Isn't it just?  It gets better.
Marge:  Oh, you don't have to do--

% Ultrahouse massages Homer as he watches TV.

Pierce: Homer, my dear fellow, you're carrying quite a bit of tension in your
        back fat.
Homer:  Yup, that's the price of success.
Pierce: Can I top you off?
Homer:  What's by blood alcohol?
Pierce: [crams a tube down Homer's throat] 0.15.
Homer:  Keep 'em coming.
Pierce: [fills Homer's mug] You know, Marge is quite a remarkable woman.
Homer:  Yeah, she's cool.
Pierce: You're certainly a lucky man to have her.
Homer:  Lucky, schmucky!  I knocked her up.  But, she's stuck now -- we're
        married till death do us part, but if I died, she'd be completely
        free, for man *or* machine.  [chuckles and leaves]
Pierce: [chuckles] Machine, eh?
          [A suspenseful chord plays.]
Homer:  [returns] Yup, a machine!

% In the middle of the night, as everyone is asleep, Pierce starts his evil
% plan.  On the stove, bacon starts to cook.  Homer wakes up, says "Mmm,
% unexplained bacon", then sleepily walks to the kitchen.  Ice cubes fall out
% of the refrigerator onto the floor.  Homer slips and fall onto the table,
% which then lifts up, forcing Homer into the garbage disposal.  Blood
% splatters on the walls and the Ultrahouse lens.
%
% The next morning, the shades open and cast light on sleeping Marge.

Pierce: Good morning, Marge.
Marge:  [yawns] Good morning, Pierce.  [notices Homer missing] Where's Homer?
Pierce: Uh ... I think he went to work early.
Marge:  That sounds like a lie.  [gasps as she notices on a family portrait
        Homer has been replaced with an Ultrahouse lens unit; she dials on the
        phone and speaks quietly:] Hello, police?  I think my house killed my
        husband!
Pierce: [on phone:] This is Constable Wiggums.  We'll be right there.  Remove
        your knickers and wait in the bath.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Marge hurls the phone at one of the lenses.  She carries her half-asleep
% children down the stairs towards the circular front door, but it closes
% before they can escape.

You're acting crazy, Marge.  Why don't you take a stress pill?  [a mechanical
hand tries to put a pill in Marge's mouth] Don't like pills, huh?  I could
shoot a dart in your neck -- your elegant swanlike neck.
-- Pierce, the Ultrahouse, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% The family runs into the livingroom, where they're frightened by a bloody
% fist punching up through the floor.  But then they see that it's Homer
% crawling out and they all hug.  Homer mocks the machine for losing to man,
% but as he turns around, the family is terrified again because his brain is
% exposed through a large hole in the back of his head.
%
% Pierce tries to hide his surprise at Homer surviving, and says he's going to
% take care of Homer.  Various painful tools emerge from the wall panels and
% advance on Homer.  As he's trying to back out of the room, the floor tiles
% disappear under Homer's feet.  Some clamps and hoses manage to get a hold of
% him.  One arm applies shaving cream to his face, and another shoves a pill
% in his mouth.  Homer ties all the hoses and things together and escapes with
% the family to go disable the central processor.
%
% In the basement, Homer takes an axe to the water softener.  Lisa points out
% his error.

Well, I *am* missing the back of my head.  I think you could cut me some
slack?
-- Homer, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Homer finds the CPU and chops of the cover, and starts removing cards.

Lisa:  There must be someone who can use a man around the house, even if he's
       slightly homicidal.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% And so, the Ultrahouse CPU finds its way to Patty and Selma's apartment,
% where Pierce is reduced to holding an ashtray for Patty.

Pierce: So, tell me more about your day at the DMV.
Patty:  Humph ... where to start?  Sheila parked in my space again.
Pierce: That Sheila, she's given you problems before, hasn't she?
Patty:  Oh, yeah.  I don't care who she's sleeping with, that's been my space
        since 1981.

Pierce: No!  Not in there!
Patty:  Now, where was I?  Oh, yeah -- Sheila.  Sheila.  Anyway, she's had an

           between to get it away from her.
Smithers:  How about Satan?
Mr. Burns: No, no, I'm docking him.  His wife has a screenplay.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% In a public restroom, Bart turns on a hand drier.  Instead of drying his
% hands, it sucks him in, and he falls into Mr. Burns's lair.  Mr. Burns tells
% Bart that Bart will be helping him.  Bart asks what happens if he doesn't.
% Mr. Burns points to a blue wall where many faces stretch from it and moan.
% Krusty's face says "I've heard of a wailing wall, but this is ridiculous!",
% but the other faces think the joke is corny and old.
%
% Mr. Burns and Bart step out onto a balcony of a cooling tower.

Mr. Burns: Anyway, how would you like to humiliate your sister?
Bart:      I'd like that.  I'd like that very much.
Mr. Burns: Now, it would involve betrayal and unspeakable evil.
Bart:      Hey, hey!  You made your sale.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Parents gather for the "Spellzapoppin' Magic Recital".  Homer watches
% football on a portable TV in the audience as Milhouse, onstage, attempts the
% invisibility cloak.  The cloak only makes his clothes invisible, and he runs
% off, embarrassed.  Principal Skinner comes out and sprinkles the audience
% with amnesia dust.  They instantly start applauding.
%
% Next, Skinner starts introducing Lisa, as a "sorceress so powerful, she made
% tonight's refreshments out of dead people!"  The audience is disgusted, so
% he uses the amnesia dust again.  They start laughing.
%
% While Skinner tells the audience that Lisa will do the "levitating dragon
% trick", behind the curtain, Bart swaps Lisa's magic wand with another one.
%
% Lisa enters and takes a bow as the curtain raises revealing a giant caged
% dragon.  She calls for the dragon to be released, and it walks out with
% thundering footsteps, and spews fire.  Everyone suddenly fears for her life,
% especially Marge and Homer, except one of Homer's eyes is drawn back to his
% TV.
%
% As the dragon advances on Lisa, she picks up the phony wand and says the
% magic words "alacazi dragonfly".  When nothing happens, she smells the wand
% and realizes it's actually a Twizzler.  Just offstage, Bart laughs.
%
% The dragon rears back and roars, then morphs into a giant Mr. Burns.  All
% the parents run out screaming, except Homer and Marge.  "Hey!  We stayed for
% *your* kids!" he yells.  

The dark Lord Montymort -- absorber of souls, sucker of essence!
-- Lisa, "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Mr. Burns picks up Lisa in his giant hand, and puts the soul-transfer
% helmets on each of them.  He holds her upside down and shakes her to get
% the lumps of soul to come out and pass through the tube.

Bart:  [gasps] This is partly *my* fault!  [takes out Lisa's magic wand] Prank
       be undone!  Destroy the evil one!  [is struck by lightning] Not me!
Lisa:  Help me, Bart!
         [Not knowing what else to do, Bart charges Mr. Burns with the charred 
          wand and stabs his leg.]
Burns: Yow!  My enchanted shin -- how did you know that was the source of my
       power?!
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% Mr. Burns topples over and shrinks back to normal size.  Lisa takes off the
% helmet and hugs Bart.

Smithers: Oh, sir, in death we shall be together always!  [sobs and eats Mr. 
          Burns whole]
Lisa:     Bart, let's stop this stupid rivalry.  Even if you never become a
          great sorcerer, you're still an okay brother.
Bart:     Thanks, Lis.  Now let's try to forget this nightmare.
-- "Treehouse of Horror XII"

% As Bart and Lisa walk off, the leprechaun from the first segment jumps onto
% Bart's back.  Bart is oblivious to the his cackling.  The leprechaun turns
% to us and shushes as there is a four-leaf-clover-shaped iris out.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 6:16  Running Time: 21:36]
%
% From the Simpsons guest stars trailer come Pierce Brosnan, the leprechaun,
% and the toad-man, each carrying baskets of fruit.

Pierce:     Wow, we really get to keep these fruit baskets?
Leprechaun: Well, they used to give us champagne till *somebody* ruined it!
            [looks at toad-man]
Toad-man:   [vomits]
Pierce:     Do they really think he'll do better with fruit?  [deactivates car
            alarm]
Leprechaun: Ooh, Mr. Movie Star gets to park right next to the stage.
Pierce:     Luck of the draw, I guess.  [chuckles nervously] Can I give you a
            ride to your car?
Leprechaun: Why sure, that'd be great!
              [They all get in and start driving away.]
Pierce:     So, where are you parked?
Leprechaun: Oh, we don't have a car.
Pierce:     But I thought you--
Leprechaun: Just keep driving, boy-o.
              [The car speeds out of the studio, crashing through the gate and
               cutting off several cars.]
            [cackles] Can I turn on the radio?  [cackles]
-- The guest stars leave, "Treehouse of Horror XII"
