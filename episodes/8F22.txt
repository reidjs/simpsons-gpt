The love bug bites Milhouse, leaving him little time for Bart; and Marge
orders a subliminal message weight-loss tape for Homer, who doesn't
understand why he's still gaining.

        ... their lips+neck+arms form a perfect heart shape? {bps}

> Reviews
===============================================================================

Karl Wagenfuehr {kw}:  Truly amoung the superior endeavors undertaken by
our laudable Simpsons concoctors -- highest accolades!

Ted Frank {thf}:  Pretty solid, though not one of the all-time greats.

Lawrence Schwimmer {las}:  Good episode!  True, the two plotlines didn't
meld together, but well-done nonetheless.

Alan J Rosenthal {ajr}:  I'd rate this in the middle-to-high range.
Quite good, but not one of the top ones.

J. D. Baldwin {jdb}:  All in all, an excellent episode.

Scott Amspoker {sa}:  I laughed out loud a lot more than usual.
The kind of episode that keeps me coming back for more.

Yours Truly {rjc}:  ``Best of show'' award goes to Milhouse's ``We started
out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.''  A close second
was ``She said she'd be wearing a plaid jumper.''

    At St. Sebastian's, a nun dances past singing ``Dominique''.
    Al Wesolowsky {abw} explains that this is a reference to Soeur
    Sourire (``Sister Smile''), a Belgian nun who could play the
    guitar and sing, and was `discovered' after she performed on a
    local TV talent show.  ``Dominique'' was a monster single in Europe
    and the U.S., hitting the top of the charts in 1965.  (No mean feat,
    considering it was an album of religious children's songs sung in
    Belgian French.)  Alas, she fell prey to emotional disorders and
    left the order after a few years and fell into obscurity.

>> Just before Milhouse comments on Samantha's dress, a student walks past
   holding a notebook, on which is drawn a heart with the inscription
   ``RW + JS''.  Any guesses?

===============================================================================
% Homer's change jar twinkles atop his dresser.  Bart cautious approaches
% and swipes it.  Homer's rumbling form appears.  ``Why you little...''
% Bart makes his escape through the house, barely exiting through the garage
% door as it closes.  (For that added dramatic touch, he has to reach back
% inside for his lucky red hat.)  He hops aboard the school bus and tips his
% hat good-bye as Homer shouts incoherently.
%
% Bart takes his seat next to Milhouse, who shows him a `Magic Eight Ball'
% his father bought for him at the Circus of Values.

Bart:     Cool!  An oversized novelty billiard ball!
Milhouse: Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the future!
Bart:     Really?
Milhouse: Uh huh.
Bart:     [takes it]  Will I pass my English test?  [shakes it]
          [reads]  ``Outlook not so good''.
          Wow, it <does> work!
-- Ask me no questions, ``Bart's Friend Falls in Love''

% Milhouse gives it a shot.  ``Will I get beat up today?''  The ball says,
% ``All signs point to Yes.''  Nelson pokes his head over the seat.  ``That
% ball knows everything.''  He slugs Milhouse.  Bart takes the ball and asks
% if he and Milhouse will be friends forever.  ``Don't count on it.''  He
% aims a little lower, but the prognosis is still bleak.  Grasping at straws,
% he asks, ``Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day?''  The
% answer is `No'.  Bart asks, ``What could come between two bestest buddies
% like us?''
%
% Dramatic close-up of a sweet little girl with braces.

Samantha, I've always been suspicious of transfer students.
Other principals try to unload problem cases that way.
Lord knows <I> do...
-- Principal Skinner welcomes a new student, ``Bart's Friend Falls in Love''

% Samantha explains that she's a <good> student, but Skinner doesn't believe
% her, momentarily going off in his own world of resentment for his Vietnam
% War service.  He checks her permanent record, which is clean, and notes
% that she beat her bedwetting problem in the second grade.  ``That's in
% there?''  ``Don't worry, they'll forget.''  Skinner lapses again.
%
% Ms. Krabappel hands out the graded tests, and the Magic Eight Ball was
% right on the money.  Skinner comes in with Samantha.  (Ms. Krabappel
% gripes about the class size.)  Skinner in his usual slip-of-the-tongue
% manner introduces Samantha Stinky (oops, I mean, Stanky).

Ms.K:     I'm sure this is a little scary for you, dear.
Samantha: Uh huh.
Ms.K:     So, why don't you stand in front of the class and tell us about
          yourself.  I'll be grading you on grammar and poise.
-- Introducing a new student, ``Bart's Friend Falls in Love''

% Samantha explains that her father owns a home security company and moved
% the family from Phoenix to Springfield because of its high crime rate and
% lackluster police force.  She also notes the weird smell of the town.
% Ms. Krabappel tells her she'll get used to it after six weeks.
%
% At lunchtime in the schoolyard, Bart offers Milhouse a Wet Willie.  Bart
% licks his finger and sticks it into Milhouse's ear.  (``Victim number
% four!'')  Bart leaves to turn Lewis into his next victim.  A stray ball
% knocks Milhouse's glasses off.  We get a Milhouse's-eye-view of the fuzzy
% world around him as he fumbles for his glasses, threatening the person
% responsible.  He puts on his glasses and sees Samantha standing sweetly,
% ball in hand.  (``Whoa.'')

Class, in order to explain why your hormones will soon make you an easy

% small and fluffy down a rabbit hole.''

Samantha: How do we know when we fall in love?
Ms.K:     Oh, don't you worry.  Most of you will never fall in love and
          marry out of fear of dying alone.  [chuckles]

Milhouse: I've brought friends to this treehouse before.

% Bart lets her stay and rummages through his Radioactive Man comics to
% find reading material more suited to the fairer sex.  He finds ``Radioactive

% Disgusted with the choice of viewing, Homer reaches for the remote control,
% but it's barely out of reach.  Rather than get up off the couch, he decides

% two reindeer standing a tearful vigil.  But to no avail.  The doctor

%
% Lisa, who is also watching, turns to see Homer's ample belly.  She imagines

Homer: I'd say you're a lying scumbag!
-- You did ask, after all, ``Bart's Friend Falls in Love''

% Lisa (wielding her copy of Eternity Magazine) suggests Homer use

Lisa:  They'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep.
       As you hear New Age music, a powerful message goes to your

Homer: Lose weight <and> listen to New Age music?  Wow!
-- ``Bart's Friend Falls in Love''

% Homer asks Marge's opinion.  She responds, ``Homer, I love you just the
% way you are.''  She then privately asks Lisa for the phone number.
%
% Marge dials the number, and the operator asks, ``Would you like to lose
% weight, stop smoking, learn the state capitals, master hostage

% Boarding the school bus, Bart sees Milhouse and Samantha kissing, so he
% reluctantly takes the empty seat next to Martin.  Martin is ecstatic.

This is the first time anyone has ever sat next to me since I successfully

-- Martin, ``Bart's Friend Falls in Love''

% Bart explains he's looking for a friend who won't leave him for a girl,

-- Man to woman in bed, ``Bart's Friend Falls in Love''

% The woman in question metamorphosizes into a space mutant.  Milhouse and

%
% Afterward, Bart suggests they go spit on Skinner's car, but Milhouse
% says, ``There's such a thing as spending <too> much time together.''
% Bart answers, ``I'm tired of watching you two lip-wrestle.  There are

%
% Chuck and Ralph comment on Milhouse's current state.

Lisa: Hey, Bart, according to this magazine, in another million years,
      man will have another finger.  [shows an artist's conception
      of a five-fingered hand]
Bart: Five fingers?  Ewwww!  Freak show!
-- Only for some, ``Bart's Friend Falls in Love''

% Bart needs some advice, but Marge isn't home.  He tried talking to Homer,

% given the state of modern technology is to confess.
%
% Mrs. Van Houten thanks Bart for coming and shows him to Milhouse's room,

% bed and full of beans!''  Mr. Van Houten is also pleased.

% Back in the Simpsons kitchen, Homer searches the drawers...

-- Paying a visit to Saint Sebastian's School for Wicked Girls,
   ``Bart's Friend Falls in Love''

% They spot her, and Milhouse presents Samantha with a ten-gallon tub of
% gummy bears.  He hands it over to her, but it's so heavy, she can't hold
% it.  (*thud*)

Bart:     Hey, Samantha, I'm sorry about getting you thrown in the
          penguin house.
Samantha: That's all right, Bart.  I love Saint Sebastian [School].
          It's run by a group of French-Canadian nuns.
          They're very nice, except they never let me ewt.
-- ``Bart's Friend Falls in Love''

% A nun sings in French and says, ``Samantha, ne pas de boys.''  The bell
% rings, and Samantha must return to class.  Milhouse puckers up, but
% Samantha says, ``I'd better not.  It's fifty rosaries a kiss.''  But she
% gives in.  ``What the heck!''  Bart and Milhouse leave.  ``Bart, think
% I can ever find another one like her?''  ``You're asking the wrong guy,
% Milhouse.  They all look alike to me.  Now let's go whip donuts at old
% people.''
