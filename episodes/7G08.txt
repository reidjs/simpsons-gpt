===============================================================================
The Simpsons prepare for the holidays, but it's rough sledding for
household-head Homer, who's forced to resort to desperate measures when
his Christmas bonus is canceled and Marge's family money goes to erase
the tattoo son Bart thought would be a perfect gift.

schoolyard culture.

>>> Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, a la Simpson

Transcription due to Chris Baird {cjb}

[Abe at the piano, Maggie riding SLH side-saddle]

     All: Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
          Had a very shiny nose,
          And if you ever saw it,
          You would even say it glows.
                [Bart:  Like a lightblub!]
                [Homer: Bart!]

          All of the other reindeer,
          Used to laugh and call him names.
                [Lisa:  Like Pergola! (?)]
                [Homer: Lisa!]

          They never let poor Rudolph,
          Join in any reindeer games.
                [Bart:  Like strip poker!]
                [Homer: I'm warning you two!]

          Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
          Santa came to say,
                [Marge: Take it Homer!]

   Homer: err... Rudolph, get your nose over here, so
          you can drive my sleigh... today.
                [Marge: Ohh, Homer...]

     All: Then all of the reindeer loved him,
          And they shouted out with glee:
          Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
          You'll go down in history!
                [Bart:  Like Attila the H- ugh, urk!]
                [Homer: You little... grrrr!]

>> Miscellaneous

Notice that Homer neglected to buy a Christmas gift for Lisa at the
Circus of Values.  (Overlooked middle child indeed.)

According to Tsukasa Nakamula, ``Hochiashi'' isn't the real Japanese Santa
Claus.

% Christmas show.  A class sings ``O Little Town of Bethlehem'' as Marge
% (carrying Maggie, all bundled up) and Homer try to reach their seats.
% Next up is the second grade, presenting, ``Santas of many lands.''  After
% the German and Japanese versions of Santa Claus comes Lisa as Towanga,
% the Santa Claus of the South Seas.  Lisa appears, wearing a witch doctor
% mask and grass skirt, juggling flaming torches.
%
% The fourth grade is next, singing Jingle Bells, but Bart chooses some
% alternate lyrics.  He's yanked off the stage.  Time passes...

Skinner: The fifth grade will now favor us with a scene from Charles
         uh.. Dickens' Christmas Carol.
Homer:   Ohhhh.... How many grades does this school have!
-- Watching the school Christmas pageant, ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

% At home, Marge writes the family Christmas letter, while Homer struggles

          thing:  Merry Christmas!

% tattoo with lasers, but he insists on a cash payment up front.  Marge

% [End of Act Two.]

Marge: [in bed, reading the shopping list]
       I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me Homer.
Homer: Huh?  Oh, I love you Marge.
Marge: Mm, Homer, you tell me that all the time.
Homer: Oh good, because I <do> love you.
       I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit
       card that won't set off that horrible beeping.
Marge: Well, I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus.
       I keep asking for it, but...
Homer: Marge...  Oh... Let me be honest with you...
Marge: Yes?
Homer: Well... I...
Marge: [rubs his hand]
Homer: I want to do the Christmas shopping this year!
Marge: [hands over the list she was holding]  Well, sure.  Okay.

% and a squeak toy pork chop for Maggie.  (``It says it's for dogs, but
% she can't read.'')  On his way out, he bumps into Ned, laden with gifts.
% Their respective armfuls of goodies fall into the snow.

Homer: [bumps into Ned.  Their respective armfuls of gifts fall into the snow]
Ned:   Oh ho ho, Simpson, it's you.
Homer: Hello, Flanders.
Ned:   Oh my, what a little mess we've got here.  Well, which ones are yours
       and which ones are mine?
Homer: Well, let's see.
Ned:   [picking up gifts] Well, this one's mine, and this one's mine, heh heh,

%
% Homer is drinking at Moe's, and Barney comes in dressed as Santa.

% ``All trees $75'', ``$60 and up'', ``Christmas trees, slightly irregular,
% $45'', heading instead for a sign that says, ``No trespassing.''  He
% chainsaws a tree and carries it to the car one step ahead of the guard
% dogs and gunfire.
%

% ``Do I smell gunpowder?''
%
% At the mall, Homer plays Santa to a young boy and tells the child that

% a bite of the kid's donut.  Lewis, Bart, and Milhouse watch the pathetic
% Santa down below.  Milhouse dares Bart to yank his beard off.  Bart accepts
% the challenge.

Bart:  Hey Santa, what's shakin', man?
Homer: [as Santa]  What's your name, Bart...ner?  Uh, little partner?

Homer: Thirteen bucks?  Hey, wait a minute.
Clerk: That's right.  $120 gross, less Social Security...
Homer: Yeah.
Clerk: ... less unemployment insurance ...
Homer: But...
Clerk: ... less Santa training...
Homer: Santa training?
Clerk: ... less costume purchase...
Homer: Wait a minute...
Clerk: ... less beard rental...
Homer: But...
Clerk: ... less Christmas Club.
Homer: But...
Clerk: See you next year.  [closes the window]
-- Paydirt, ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

% Barney is on his way to Springfield Downs.  He's got a hot tip on a dog
% in the fourth race.  Whirlwind, a 12--1 shot.  Homer isn't so sure.

Bart:  Aw come on, Dad.  This could be the miracle that saves the Simpsons'
       Christmas.  If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always
       happen to poor kids at Christmas.  It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened
       to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's going to happen
       to us!
Homer: Well, okay, let's go.  Who's Tiny Tim?
-- ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

% [more audio dropout.  I really gotta get cable...]
% Lisa watches `The Happy Little Elves'.
%
% Homer, Bart, and Barney arrive at Springfield Downs.  In the fourth race,
% there's been a scratch.  The replacement is a dog named Santa's Little
% Helper.  Homer figures, with a name like that, it can't lose.  The odds
% are 99--1.  Bart isn't so sure that this is a great idea, but he
% reluctantly lends his support.
%
% Back at home, the Happy Little Elves are happy again, and Lisa is pleased.
% Patty bad-mouths Homer.

Lisa:  What, Aunt Patty?
Patty: Oh, nothing, dear.  I'm just trashing your father.
Lisa:  Well, I wish you wouldn't because, aside from the fact that he has the
       same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have.
       Therefore, he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will
       govern the prospects of my adult relationships.
       So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me,
       and I am far too young to defend myself against such onslaughts.
Patty: Mm hm.  Go watch your cartoon show, dear.
-- ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

% The race is run, and SLH is dead last.  Way, way behind the rest of the pack.

Don't worry, Dad.  Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens.
-- Bart's been watching too much TV, ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

% Whirlwind wins.  SLH doesn't even make it to the finish line.

It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.
-- Bart, ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

% Outside, Homer and Bart go through the discarded tickets in search of
% a winner.  Barney skids past, brandishing his winnings (and Daria).
% SLH's owner tells the dog to scram, and SLH leaps into Homer's arms.

Bart:  Oh, Dad, can we keep him?
Homer: But he's a loser!  He's pathetic!  He's...
SLH:   [licks Homer's face]
Homer: ... a Simpson.
-- ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

% Homer finally arrives home, and admits that he didn't get a bonus at all.
% Bart shows the family SLH, and Lisa is ecstatic.  ``So love at first
% sight <is> possible!''  Adds Bart, ``And if he runs away, he'll be easy
% to catch!''  Marge says it's the best gift of all, something to share
% their love, and frighten prowlers.  The tender moment is captured forever
% in a snapshot.
%
% [End of Act Three.]
%
% [Over the closing credits, OFF sing a Christmas carol.]
