==============================================================================
   While Marge and Lisa are away cleaning up and oil spill, Bart becomes
   the right-hand man for the owner of a burlesque house.

==============================================================================
> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Couch      :- OFF sits on the couch, which is a mostly clever and
              detailed parody of The Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
              Hearts Club Band" album cover.  [see Comments for details]

==============================================================================
> Did you notice...
==============================================================================
   ... all the stuff in the couch scene, including wax statues from the
       Tracey Ullman era?  [see Comments for a lengthy description]
   ... Bongo (of "Life in Hell" fame) is sitting in the I&S audience?
   ... Lisa and Marge are cleaning rocks with toothbrushes?
   ... when the oily tide rolls in, Maggie pulls her pacifier out of her
       mouth and holds it up high?
   ... the side of the cleanup chief's vehicle says "BEGLEY 2000"?
   ... the mailbox that Homer knocked down is still there the night he
       comes to pick up Bart, but it's up the next morning?
   ... Marge has lived in Springfield all of her 37 years and is a
       third-generation Springfieldian?
   ... Smithers' parents seem to disapprove of his choice of lifestyle?

Dale G. Abersold:
   ... according to the closed captioning, Mrs. Van Houten's first name
       is "Luana"?
        [My own version had "Luanan". Anyway, it will be changed to
        Luanne in 4F04 --ed]
   ... Springfield has a burlesque house _and_ a bordello?
   ... Yeardley Smith provided the voice of one of the chorus girls? (a
       very rare non-Lisa role for Ms. Smith)
   ... for the _seventh_ consecutive episode, they haven't used the
       normal Simpsons theme for the closing credits?  (Last
       time-[3F20])

Keith Bailey:
   ... Rainier Wolfcastle and the Golden Globe nominee are talking about
       saving the environment, yet they are wearing fur coats?

Stephan Bonneville:
   ... Ned and Maude have an unusual lust for violence in this episode?
   ... how disappointed Smithers looked leaving the house?
   ... Marge can operate heavy machinery?
   ... Moleman's flaming arrow barely misses Marge's head?
   ... we see Jack Marley from 9F05?
   ... Ralph and Martin are boating in ankle deep water?
   ... Bart and Homer are watching a bumper car derby?
   ... one of the pictures at Maison Derriere appears to have Lunch Lady
       Doris in it?
   ... the erotic picture on the wall behind Homer and Belle?
   ... Mr. Burns still owns an extremely old antique car?

Frederic Briere:
   ... Marge seems to have lost a lot of her French accent?

James R. Curry:
   ... Marges hair is messed up after working on the beach all day, you
       can see a strand sticking out in the close up?
   ... Homer sets Bart's plate with a knife and fork, but only has a
       fork himself?
   ... when Marge returns home, Maggie and Lisa vanish from the episode
       completely?
   ... when the mob arrive at the house, the gargoyle which Bart knocked
       down appears to be fixed?
   ... Bart never really gets punished, he enjoys his punishment?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Tress MacNeille got a "starring" (as opposed to "also starring")
       credit?  (The only other "regular" to get one was Pamela Hayden
       in 2F17)
   ... Homer called Mrs. Lovejoy "Helen", something few (if any) other
       characters have ever done to her face?

       would have a tanker going through it) coast?

       Carbon Monoxide in the house?

       the caterpillar crawled over it?
   ... despite Doris Grau being dead, Lunch Lady Doris is alive?
   ... in the audience when Princess Kashmir is dancing is Charlie and -
       well, that's either David Crosby or John Swartzwelder?

Dominik Halas:
   ... Milhouse's "perfectly level flying" line sounds like it came
       straight from a book?
   ... Smithers brings a candelabrum to the picnic?
   ... Apu swinging in a tree outside Maison Derriere?

Jason Hancock:
   ... in the I&S cartoon, Scratchy is able to read the captions on the
       screen?
   ... the bottle of Heinz ketchup on the dinner table?
   ... Burns' monogrammed picnic basket?
   ... when Burns says "too many fat children," Martin and Ralph split?

   ... "local perverts" Eugene and Rusty have very pale skin (probably
       from surfing the Internet)?
   ... Patty lighting up a cigarette in photograph?
   ... Quimby's wife wearing same outfit from [1F05] (and what Marge
       wore in [3F06])

       Scratchy theme song in quite a while?

   ... Maison Derriere has an outdated 1930s-era phone?
   ... Homer seems to have forgotten the lesson he learned in 7G10 about
       treating women like sex objects? (He drools at bare naked tease
       Princess Cashmere in front of Bart, yet again)
   ... a silly song overrules the solid Christian, moral values of
       Flanders? (never mind Helen Lovejoy and Timothy Lovejoy)
   ... Belle would rather let Marge try her hand at ventriloquism than
       ask for damage repair money?

David Ney:
   ... Lisa's peach tree looks a lot like Springfield's lemon tree?
   ... OFF's car was made in 1987?
   ... this is the first episode we see Groundskeeper Willy since he was
       deported?
        [though in p-code order, he's shown since 4F01 --ed]

Damian Penny:
   ... Mr. Burns has a Model T Ford?
   ... Marge can handle a bulldozer?
   ... Bart's fascination with womens' undergarments?
   ... Rainer Wolfcastle is suddenly an environmentalist?

Mark Aaron Richey:
   ... the talk show host is a mouse?

       left)?
   ... the gargoyle's tongue was sticking out?

       head?

       house is a little darker than normal?

Ana Robles:

       mousse)?
   ... Ralph says "*a* Frankenstein"?

   ... Marge is a TERRIBLE ventriloquist?

Matt Rose:
   ... According to Marge, Alaska is only 400 miles from Springfield?

Liam J. Scanlan:
   ... only one dancer was ever totally naked?
   ... Homer's age goof from 4F03 and Marge's age goof fit perfectly?
   ... Tress MacNeille got a "Starring" credit? (she's the third extra
       to get do this)

Rick Senger:
   ... investigative reporter Dave Shelton (also from the fish 'sode)
       standing to the right as Captain McAllister is busted for running
       the ship aground?
   ... Snowball II requires daily doses of medication?
   ... Grampa drinks Whiskey sours?
   ... Kearney, Jimbo and Dolph comprise a remarkably strong singing
       trio?
   ... Marge says a word that sounds an awful lot like "shit"?

Marge Starbrod Simpson:
   ... even Otto was against Maison Derriere?
   ... this is the first time Dolph has opened his mouth since 3F02?

*  Baby fur seals (who grow into harp seals) are raised on ice floes,
   not beaches. The cutest stars of the Valdez spill was the sea otters.
   {hl}

*  An oily seal couldn't be fully cleaned simply by rubbing it with a
   towel.  {dh}

*  There is no way a cat could walk on nails that long.  {dh}

*  How can Lisa go on this trip, anyway?  She's got school!  {ol}

*  If the bag McBain had was full of sandpipers, it wouldn't have been
   anywhere close to 150 pounds.  {sb}

*  The garbage beneath Homer's and Bart's heads and torsos shouldn't
   have been cleared away in the process of making "garbage angels".
   {dh}

+  Since when have Martin and Ralph been friends?

*  Martin and Ralph couldn't have pedalled the boat into such shallow
   water.  {dh}

=  OFF's house is drawn a little differently when Bart is dragged home.
   {jh}

+  Once again, there is no Bush/Ford house across the street.  This is
   the last time I'm going to mention it.  {mar}

-  When Belle opens the door to Bart when he arrives to help out, her
   arm is completely yellow for a few frames, before the sleeve of her
   gown appears.  {jrc}

-  Homer looks no fatter with or without groceries in his grocery bag
   underwear.  {ljs}

*  Isn't it illegal for a minor to be working in a burlesque house?
   {ol}

+  This had a casino ever since it opened a long time ago. Yet gambling
   wasn't legalized till 1F08.  {ljs}

-  When Lionel Hutz is shooting craps, the dice don't start rolling
   until they reach the near end of the table.  {ddg}

-  One of the craps dice has a 5 next to a 2 (no real dice have two
   adjacent sides that total 7)  {ddg}

+  Grampa must have bought his hat back, because in 7F17, Herman puts it
   up for sale.  {ljs}

=  Like "Home Alone" (but unlike past episodes such as [7F20] and
   [9F20]), the house was cleaned inexplicably.  {dga}

=  The set of matches Marge was holding disappears.  {ol}
    [why hire her as ventriloquist when she's a great magician? --ed]

+  Marge has been about 34 years old in previous episodes.  (It appears
   that she's been aged to match Homer's new age of 38 given in 4F03, a
   rather stupid thing to do since it's long been accepted that none of
   the characters age.)  {dh}

=  When Marge, Lisa, and Maggie are leaving for the spill, the station
   wagon is red, but when Marge has the valet get it at the Maison, she
   says it's "light pink", the color of their other car.  {ddg}

=  Quimby's suntan is very visible in his first scene, but is gone for
   the rest of his screen time  {ar}

+  Why would Marge object to gambling? In 1F08 she was for it.  {sb}

+  Considering that Springfield has a rather thriving red-light district
   (as evidenced in [7G10] "Homer's Night Out"), why should this one
   relatively tasteful burlesque house put everyone in an uproar (of
   course, Bart didn't work at the strip joints in [7G10]).

*  Where is Lisa and Maggie during the mob scene?  Marge should know
   better than to leave 8-year-old Lisa and baby Maggie home alone. (And
   no one will babysit for them anymore, and Grampa was clearly at the
   meeting and in the mob).  {ol}

=  Krusty, Wiggum, and Skinner are outside in one shot during the song,
   but they are inside looking out the window in the next shot.  {jh}

=  During Bart's comedy routine, Dr Nick is wearing his white labcoat
   when seen from behind, but a pink shirt when seen from the front.
   {dh}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  I don't think there's ever been an episode like this
   one. This was just plain weird.  There were dozens of great gags, but
   they didn't seem to jell together.  In the end, however, it fulfilled
   the requirement of good Simpsons episodes: it made me laugh loudly
   and often. Kudos to Tress MacNeille on a great performance as Belle.
   (B+)

Jennifer M. Blaske:  Mmmm ... I would have liked this episode better if
   I had left about halfway through it. I didn't care at all for the
   Marge-teaming-up-with-Flanders-and-Lovejoy-to-fight-immorality bit.
   The song itself was well done, but seemed out of place - I didn't
   like it when it first started. The whole ending with the bulldozer
   and ventriloquist stuff left me cold. But the first half was pretty
   fun, although the peach tree scene was awkward and unnecessary.  (C-)

Stephan Bonneville:  There were some pretty good lines in this episode
   eg. Ralph: "I'm peddling backwards!" but yet again we see a flat
   ending that was only saved this time by a great song from the
   townspeople. The Smithers jokes are wearing a bit thin.  (B)

Jeff Clarke:  A poor episode not even up to the standards of recent
   years.  Flat jokes, and not many of those. The writers didn't seem to
   know what they wanted to say. A good argument against syndication.
   (D)

Chris Courtois:  "Bart After Dark" was a bit of a mixed bag. I really
   liked some parts, like the Homer/Bart scenes, and the model airplane
   flight. But other parts, such as the intolerant-Marge-on-a-crusade
   turn the story took and the Springfield-is-an-easily-swayed-mob-of-
   idiots, have been done before multiple times and are getting kinda
   stale. And Lisa... well, I think the portrayal of Lisa has gotten so
   inconsistent it no longer makes sense to say whether she's in or out
   of character.  (B)

Dominik Halas:  A good episode that didn't have any point or message,
   but did have a lot of great jokes.  It could have easily fit in with
   episodes from the Fifth Season. Unlike many recent episodes, none of
   the humour here was forced; it all flowed naturally.  The song was
   one of the best since "Who Needs The Kwik-E-Mart?", and the
   discussion following it was a great send-up of the whole concept of
   songs suddenly appearing in the middle of a show.  (A)

Jason Hancock:  I thought this was the best episode of the season so
   far.  The slide show was the funniest moment of the season for me,
   topping last week's Hans Moleman scene, and the song was well done
   (although the Stonecutters' song remains my favorite musical number).
   The "Marge as a ventriloquist" ending was a little too weird, though.
   (A-)

Ryan Johnson:  Ye gads!  Another monstrosity!  The first two acts were
   actually fairly solid, but the last five minutes were absolutely
   horrid.  I'm still waiting for an episode this season which doesn't
   have to introduce a bunch of new characters and locations.  First
   act:B Second act:B- Third act:not gradable.  (D-)

Ricardo Lafaurie:  Well, actually, it seemed to be going well.  Then,
   unfortunately, we get More Musical Mucilage.  I despise this
   "musical" "comedy" that we see in "Animaniacs" all the time.  I'm not
   making fun of "Animaniacs", I just hate the songs.  And to see this
   on OFF, altogether too many times (also the terrible "Who Needs the
   Kwik-E-Mart" ruin-the-whole-episode-thing).  Without the song, it's a
   B -- but as it stands, a  (D)

Ondre Lombard:  This one had some very fine jokes in it, taking it over
   the average mark.  It was going good up until Act Three, where it
   slammed into a wall with Marge's preachy moral crusade and the
   unnecessary showstopper tune. I also don't entirely care for the
   characterization on Lisa, but overall it had a wacky plotline and it
   was a solid episode.  (B-)

Blaine Moller:  Sorry, but I thought this episode sucked.  No good gags,
   homer was a little too far out of character.  The ending was a bit
   unusual, I guess it was some kind of musical satire.  Marge was also
   a bit out of character, not usually so violent (vs.Itchy and
   Scratchy) Where did Marge learn to drive a bulldozer?  (C-)
        
John Mulhausen:  I'm pleased with this episode, myself. It seems the
   Simpsons is getting back to that dense joke-per-minute rate they're
   so notable of...I don't see what a lot of people's problem is with
   the characters...Marge has always been a moral upholder in the
   show...They all turned to her expecting her to be against legalized
   gambling. The last three lines were priceless..The angry mob scene
   was perfect. And Homer as the only parental figure was great. Though
   it's not up to some of the more classic episodes, it's certainly
   reassuring as to where the show's headed this season. (those first
   few episodes were real bombs).  (B)

David Ney:  Man, what a cool episode!  The Simpsons have not lost their
   charm!  The humor was great, the story was great, and just about
   everything in the episode was great!  The ending was kind of weak,
   but other than that, It was a really good episode!  Best of the
   season so far!  I think this episode and the last episode are good
   indications of more great episodes to come!  (A-)

Mark Aaron Richey:  What, on the surface, looks like a cross between
   [8F03] "Bart the Murderer" and [7F09] "Itchy and Scratchy and Marge"
   turns out to be something terrific.  The funniest episode of the
   season, complete with one of those brilliant musical numbers that
   only OFF can do so well.  A great job by Tress MacNeille as Belle.
   (A-)

Ana Robles:  Another good episode!  Season number seven is starting to
   pick up.  I liked this episode a lot, even though it didn't get many
   LOL's. The song was GREAT, my favorite part was the bullie's three
   part harmony.  Some other good parts were the Lisa's peach tree song,
   trash angles, "I'm peddling backwards!", the slide-show, and Marge
   missing the song.  My only complaint is that the whole oil spill
   thing just seemed like a lame excuse to get rid of Marge and Lisa for
   a little while, and could of been made into a much funnier subplot.
   Still, a good solid Simpson's show.  (A-)

Matt Rose:  The couch opening was funny, and the song at the end was
   cute, but the rest of it was disappointing. My expectations for this
   episode were fairly high; I had a good feeling about it and instead I
   think it's the worst episode of the season so far. Very few jokes and
   gags at all. I did not like the subplot, either. I think once again
   they went too far with Lisa's political and environmental concerns. I
   found the idea that Marge could actually be brainwashed into driving
   to Alaska very hard to swallow.  (C-)

Rick Senger:  Overall, a positive episode.  Some gags fizzled, but a
   high number of jokes attempted, which usually bodes well.  The
   burlesque house was just funny and different enough from the episode
   in which Homer permits Bart to work for gangsters that we forgive the
   obvious theft of the concept.  The remote controlled plane bit had
   potential but disappointed. Funnier was Lisa and Marge's foray into
   oil clean-up, and especially Homer and Bart's early exuberance at
   being unsupervised together in the Simpson's household.  (B+)

Nelson Seggley:  The best episode I've seen this season. As usual, the
   jokes play off of the characters' most noticeable traits (Homer's
   stupidity, Marge's zealotry, Lisa's do-goodery, etc). 
      Gripes: I didn't like the ending. It was funny, but it didn't
   resolve anything. Did the burlesque house stay or not? I couldn't
   understand it. Also, why did homer actually follow through with his
   alleged intention to punish Bart? It seems quite unlike him. All in
   all, though, I laughed quite a lot.  (B+)

Aaron Varhola:  Funny, incisive, and an excellent star turn by Tress
   MacNeille as Belle.  It's strange how "nobody knows" there's a
   burlesque house (read: strip club) in one's own town, yet most men
   have gone there at least once. The one big flaw with this episode was
   Marge as the crusader against the club; government censorship is not
   in character with her established beliefs.  An outside agitator, say,
   Birge Barlow, would have been much better. The couch gag was faboo.
   Would have been an easy A if Marge wasn't the ringleader of the
   censorship mob.  (B)

Yours Truly:  Funny (or should I say, unfunny) how this episode reminds
   me of Lisa the Vegetarian [3F03]; a rising episode throughout the
   first two acts, which plunges to death in the third. Here we have a
   great plot and a stellar (though short) sub-plot, which has the
   glorious merit of putting Marge in a funny situation. But then, she
   comes back, acts as the righteous moral conscience of Springfield,
   and the show goes freefall to the song. (Hope you liked it -- I
   didn't.) Fortunately, a nice ending and the strength of the first two
   acts made up for this, but I'm afraid the writers' inability to cope
   with Marge will put us in front of a difficult choice.  (B+)

>> Your Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band Membership Pack

Mark Aaron Richey:  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is considered
   by many not only to be the Beatles best album, but the best rock
   album of all time.  The couch gag is a terrific takeoff on "Sgt.
   Pepper"'s album cover, which featured many past celebrities standing
   behind the Fab Four (who were wearing those striking bandleader
   outfits that OFF was modeling).

Dominik Halas:  The couch scene in 4F06 is a clever parody of the
   Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band" album cover.  It
   shows OFF, in full Sgt. Pepper uniforms, running to their couch in
   front of a backdrop of numerous Simpsons characters, posed as on the
   original album.  I've described the arrangement of the characters
   below. (Note that there isn't a one-to-one correspondence between
   characters in the couch scene and people on the album cover.)

   - Top Row (left to right):

   Patty, Selma, Captain Lance Murdock (only the top of his helmet is
   visible), someone I can't identify directly below Murdock (it might
   be Rainier Wolfcastle, ie McBain), Apu (although he is white (er,
   yellow) and his hair is grey - an animation error), Barney,
   Radioactive Man, Reverend Lovejoy, Principal Skinner, Sideshow Bob,
   Otto, Smithers (either Otto or Smithers is forming a V with their
   fingers above Mayor Quimby's head), Mr. Burns, Dr. Marvin Monroe,
   Herb Powell, Ned Flanders, Jimbo, and Kearney.

   - Second Row (this begins beneath Burns, and goes to the right):

   Itchy, Moe, Troy McClure, someone I can't identify, and Dolph.

   - Third Row (left to right):

   Hans Moleman, Chief Wiggum, (the Marge dummy's hair -see below), Kent
   Brockman, Mrs Krabappel, Grampa, Ms Hoover, Dr Hibbert, Scratchy,
   Mayor Quimby (with his hand raised, palm forward, Quimby is the
   counterpart of Issy Bonn on the album cover), Cletus, Brandine, the
   Comic Book Guy, Krusty, Princess Kashmere (her arms akimbo, she is
   the counterpart of Diana Dors on the album cover), Lou (although he
   is drawn yellow), and Eddie.

   Additionally, there is a plant above Lou and Eddie, corresponding to
   the palm tree on the album cover. (I would have put Sideshow Bob here
   instead, since his hair looks just like the tree on the album cover.)

   - Fourth Row (left to right):

   Bleeding Gums Murphy, Sherri or Terri, a Homer dummy, a Marge dummy
   (more on this below), Terri or Sherri, the couch, Martin, Milhouse
   (Martin and Milhouse are both standing on a riser), Nelson (holding a
   Krusty doll, which is the counterpart of the Shirley Temple doll on
   the album cover).

   - The OFF dummies:

   On the original album cover, the Beatles were actually portraying a
   fictional group known as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the
   premise being that the band had just finished a show in a park
   somewhere, and they were posing for a photo with a crowd behind them.
   Peter Blake, the man who designed the cover, decided to add waxworks
   of the Beatles themselves (obtained from Madame Tussauds) because he
   thought that the Beatles "might be looking at Sgt. Pepper's Band
   too."  The waxworks were of the Beatles in their early moptop days.
   The OFF dummies in the couch scene represent OFF as drawn on Tracey
   Ullman, and are wearing dark suits like those of the Beatle dummies
   on the album cover.  The arrangement of the dummies is as follows:
   Homer and Marge at the back, and Bart and Lisa at the front, with
   Maggie between them.  Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are standing on a riser.

   - Other Tidbits:

   In front of the couch is a drum; the pattern on it is very similar to
   that of the drum on the album cover, although the drum in the couch
   scene has no words on it. (The album cover's drum reads "Sgt.
   Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".)  Santa's Little Helper is to the
   left of the drum; Snowball II is to the right.

   Below the drum, the word "SIMPSONS" is spelled out in donuts on the
   floor, corresponding to "BEATLES" (spelled out in flowers) on the
   album cover. There is a variety of artifacts arranged around the
   word, not all of which I was able to identify.  They include
   (clockwise, starting from the right of the drum):

   a bust of Jebediah Springfield (in the same place as the bust from
   John Lennon's house on the album cover), what might be a Be Sharps
   lunchbox, Blinky the Three-eyed Fish in a fishbowl (directly to the
   right of "SIMPSONS"), a plate of pink jello, a Squishie, a bowling
   ball, a Happy Little Elves doll (directly beneath "SIMPSONS", in the
   same place as the four-armed Indian doll on the album cover), an
   upside-down ice cream cone, a bottle of Simpson and Sons Revitalizing
   Tonic, what might be bags of snack food, and a very hilarious fat
   Homer doll, corresponding to the Japanese stone figure on the album
   cover.  Above the word "SIMPSONS" there is a line of what might be
   beer cans.  At the very right a copy of the Be Sharps "Bigger Than
   Jesus" album can partially be seen.

   After a few frames, OFF runs into the scene.  Homer and Marge
   (holding Maggie in her arms) run from the left of the screen; Bart
   and Lisa run from the right. Marge is dressed like John, in green;
   Maggie's uniform has a hat like Ringo's, but the hat and uniform are
   red, not pink. Homer, in blue, is Paul.  Lisa, in pink, is Ringo, but
   she isn't wearing the hat. Bart, in red, is dressed as George.  On
   the album cover, John was holding a French horn, Ringo was holding a
   trumpet, Paul was holding an English horn, and George was holding a
   flute.  Here, Marge is holding Maggie, Homer is holding a glass of
   beer, Lisa is holding her saxophone, and Bart is holding a slingshot.
   Lisa and Bart stand on the couch; Marge and Homer stand in front of
   it.  On the album cover, the order, left to right, was: John, Ringo,
   Paul, and George (or green, pink, blue, red.)  Here, it's green
   (Marge), blue (Homer), pink (Lisa), and red (Bart).

   After looking to his right and then his left, Homer decides to turn
   his back to the "camera".  This is a reference to the back of the
   Sgt. Pepper album, where the four Beatles stood in a row, Paul with
   his back to the camera.

   The chord which is heard during the couch scene is quite similar to
   the very famous final chord of the final song on the album, "A Day In
   The Life".


>> Not Yet Rated

Mark Aaron Richey:  The V-chip is a piece of technology that is supposed
   to allow parents to automatically block out all programs that some
   group deems as "violent". Few, if any, TV sets with this chip are on
   the market now (even though the US Government wants them on all sets
   soon), and it's especially unlikely that OFF's old Carnivale would
   have one installed.


>> O-pe-ra

Mark Aaron Richey:  For a while, the afternoon lineup on many TV
   stations around the US were occupied with these talk shows (which the
   I&S cartoon was poking fun at), most of which featured "normal"
   people screaming at each other or worse about their truly depraved
   problems for the entertainment of the audience and home viewers.
   Luckily for us, the ratings for most of them have gone way down, and
   many have been cancelled or shifted to bad time slots.  BTW, a couple
   of weeks ago, the "talk show" trial wrapped up, where a man was
   convicted of murdering another man who had told the first man (who
   was straight) that he had a crush on him, on the "Jenny Jones" show
   (one of the worst offenders).


>> Where'd that coast come from?

Mark Aaron Richey:  In 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska,
   dumping around 250,000 barrels of oil into Prince William Sound. Like
   Capt. McAllister, the capitain, Joseph Hazelwood, was drunk at the
   time. Unlike last night's spill, this one took a long time start
   cleaning up, because no one would admit responsibility and start
   working.  The accident ended up costing Exxon $3 billion.


>> We call him our Seal of Approval

Damian Penny:  The celebrities rushing to clean off the baby seals is an
   obvious reference to the mid-70s controversy over the seal hunt off
   Newfoundland, when animal rights groups - slobbering over cute cuddly
   animals with tear-filled eyes that could grace many a fund-raising
   poster - protested.  Most notable was Brigitte Bardot, who posed for
   a famous photo cuddling a "baby seal" (most likely a stuffed doll,
   since anyone with as little experience around the sea as Bardot would
   never be able to actually hold one).  I'm from Newfoundland and
   remember the controversy, so I loved the bit about all the animals
   being "reserved for celebrities".


>> Not as funny as the Emmys...

Mark Aaron Richey:  One of the more important movie awards out there,
   the Golden Globes are given every January by the Hollywood Foreign
   Press Association, and are considered a good predictor for the
   Oscars.  Unlike the Academy Awards, the Picture, Actor, and Actress
   categories are divided between comedies and dramas, meaning it's not
   nearly as difficult to get a nomination, which is how such noted
   thespians as Arnold Schwarzenneger can proudly boast that they've
   been Golden Globe Nominees.  Actually, the winners do usually go on
   to an Oscar nomination, espically the Drama winners.  There's also a
   TV branch, which to my knowledge, has never honored OFF, either.


>> That fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad!

Mark Aaron Richey:  One of the classic horror novels, Mary Shelley's
   Frankenstein tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young
   scientist who becomes obsessed with the concept of reanimating life,
   and eventually creates a creature from discarded body parts, only to
   abandon him in fear.  The creature isn't too pleased with this. There
   have been several movie versions of this, the most recent being in
   1994 with Kenneth Braungh and Robert DeNiro, but the most famous one,
   with Boris Karloff, bears little relation to the novel except the
   bare plot.  As I've mentioned, Frankenstein is the name of the
   scientist, not the monster.


>> I'm not an environmentalist, but I play one on TV

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  The electric runabout the beach cleanup chief
   drove was supposedly a Begley 2000.  Ed Begley, Jr. is an actor, most
   famous for playing young Dr. Erlich on "St. Elsewhere."  (The
   Internet Movie Database credits him with numerous other movies.) He's
   also an activist for environmental causes, including promoting
   electric cars.  (One media stunt involved his living in his regular
   car for a week to prove, um, that you can gain media attention by
   living in your car for a week.  Or something like that.)  I don't
   believe that Mr. Begley is involved with an electric-vehicle firm,
   but it was a cute reference anyway.


>> From the Back of My Mind

"Derriere" is a proposition, the French equivalent of "back". Basically,
   "Maison Derriere" would mean "the house at the back" or "the house
   back there". Now, as many pointed out, this word can also have a
   double meaning, but it is not at all naughty, just a mild version of
   "butt".


>> Hands Off My Shopper!

Dale G. Abersold:  Homer mentioned that he has to get up early to swipe
   Flanders' newspaper. "This must be a continuity error," you say. "The
   Simpsons subscribe to the Daily Shopper."  Au contraire!  In the
   past, the Shopper was free, but in more recent episodes (especially
   [3F18]), it now costs at least 25 cents. Evidently, Homer no longer
   subscribes to it.  Why bother?


>> Happy birthday... yet again

Calvin Henry-Cotnam:  When Marge meets with the woman of the burlesque
   house, she says something to the effect of "in all my 35 years..."
   (it may not have been 35, but it was close to that).

   Think about it:

   - if she is 35 and Bart is 10, she had Bart when she was 25
   - but didn't she have Bart within a couple of years of leaving high
     school?
   - the flashback episodes to high school are in the
     early-mid-seventies, so that would make her about 35 in 1996, but
   - Bart should be pushing close to 20 now?!?

   Of course, many cartoons/comics do not age their characters (eg:
   Peanuts!) the way some do (eg: For Better or For Worse), but the
   Simpsons seems to age *some* characters while not aging *others*.


>> That's Proposition 24 + 7

Aaron Varhola:  This past election, Oregon voted on whether to amend its
   constitution to allow "obscenity" to be banned by local option. (The
   Oregon Supreme Court ruled several years ago that "obscenity",
   whatever THAT is, was protected under the Oregon Constitution, as it
   grants greater freedom than the U.S. Constitution).  Christian
   Coalition-influenced groups tried to paint such, uh, burlesque clubs
   as destroying Oregon. (They're not. Californians are destroying
   Oregon). One of the contributors against this measure was none other
   than Matt Groening; his check caused a buzz around the No on 31
   campaign headquarters. :)


>> Wanna Hear Something Disturbing?

Jason Hancock:  I have a feeling that Patty eventually lost her interest
   in men after "MacGyver" was canceled and her relationship with
   Principal Skinner ended.  Also, remember when she saw Homer running
   naked in "Treehouse of Horror III" and said, "There goes the last
   lingering thread of my heterosexuality?"  (Granted, it was a
   Halloween episode, where continuity doesn't count.)

Jim Smith:  You're ignoring another possibility.  Maybe Patty _works_ at
   the burlesque house.


>> Car Watch

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  Looks like Monty Burns has added another car to
   his fleet -- a Ford Model T.  This one is an earlier model,
   identifiable by its flat-topped fenders and white tires (which were
   the style at the time). Eventually, Ford would switch to more
   modern-looking rounded fenders, and sturdier black tires.  Notice
   that the radiator and headlamps are chrome-colored, while the rest of
   the car's hardware is brass. [This is an error -- the Model T started
   out with nickel-plated fittings, which have a slightly yellowish
   tinge.  Later, these parts would be painted black.]

   Burn's car is green.  Surprisingly, this is not an error, as Model
   T's were originally available in a variety of colors.  It was only
   later, as production rates increased, that the `black only' policy
   went into effect.  The factory needed fast-drying paint to keep the
   assembly lines moving, and the only paint that would dry quickly
   enough happened to be a black enamel.


>> Fashion model, ventriloquist's dummy, what's the difference?

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  `Twiggy,' the name Marge have to her dummy
   doppelganger, has a double significance.  Of course, it refers to the
   fact the dummy is made of wood.  But, there was also an English
   fashion model by that name.  Her parents didn't inflict the name
   `Twiggy' on some helpless infant; Twiggy's manager gave her the name
   because he thought she was as thin as a twig.  Twiggy was the Kate
   Moss of her day -- very popular and very skinny.  Her heyday was in
   the late sixties, which is about when Marge would be a young teen,
   and paying the most attention to fashion models.


>> A Tale of Three Promotions

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  Fox's promotion strategy for this episode was
   more interesting than usual.  Commercials that aired during
   prime-time claimed that Springfield would be rocked by a sex scandal,
   and showed Marge's incriminating pictures of people leaving the
   Maison Derriere.  A promo that aired during Fox's Saturday morning
   lineup was less racy -- it showed the scene where Homer and Bart make
   `garbage angels' in the living room.  A third promo, which aired on
   my local rock radio station, played up the sex angle again, and
   quoted Homer: `I have misplaced my pants.'  (Notice how much dirtier
   this sounds when it's used out of context.)  To my knowledge, this is
   the first time Fox has targeted its `Simpsons' promotions to a
   particular advertising venue.


>> Lyrics for "The Spring In Springfield"

Dominik Halas provides us with the lyrics for this song:

                     Homer: You could close down Moe's,
                            Or the Kwik-E-Mart,
                            And nobody would care,
                            But the heart and soul
                            Of Springfield's in
                            Our Maison Derriere!

                             [music starts]

                     Belle: We're the sauce on your steak,
                            We're the cheese in your cake,
                            We put the spring in Springfield.
            Dancing Girl 1: We're the lace on the nightgown,
            Dancing Girl 2: The point after touchdown,
   Belle and Dancing Girls: Yes we put the spring in Springfield.

                     Belle: We're that little extra spice
                            That makes existence extra-nice,
                            A giddy little thrill
                            At a reasonable price.
                   Lovejoy: Our only major quarrel's
                            With your total lack of morals.
            Dancing Girl 3: Our skimpy costumes ain't so bad,
            Dancing Girl 4: They seem to entertain your dad!

   Belle and Dancing Girls: The gin in your martini,
                            The clams on your linguine,
                            Yes we keep the
                             [Belle flicks Bumblebee Man's antenna]
                            In Springfield!

  Wiggum, Krusty & Skinner: We remember our first visit,
              Mayor Quimby: The service was exquisite!
                Mrs Quimby: Why Joseph, I had no idea!
              Mayor Quimby: Come on now, you were working here!
         Grampa and Jasper: Without it we'd have had no fun
                            Since March of 1961!
                      Bart: To shut it down now would be twisted,
    Jimbo, Dolph & Kearney: We just heard this place existed!

             Dancing Girls: We're the highlights in your hairdo,
                       Apu: The extra arms on Vishnu,
             Dancing Girls: So don't take the
                             [Barney opens a jack-in-the-box]
                       Mob: We won't take the
                             [Sideshow Mel blows on his slide-whistle]

                             [Moe crashes two garbage can lids together]
                            In Springfield!

   [Krusty hits his face with a pie, Willy accidentally hits Lenny in
   the head with a sledgehammer, Wiggum and the Comic Book Guy bounce
   their bellies together, Burns honks the horn on his antique car,
   Cap'n MacAllister reels in a fish, and Barney burps.]


>> Those Immortal Threads

   - Is Smithers Gay?

Haynes Lee:  Photograph shown of a dejected Smithers leaving a burlesque
   house. When Burns asks for an explanation he says "My parents
   insisted I give it a try".

   - Where is Springfield?

Dominik Halas:  Lisa said she wanted to clean an otter at the beach; sea
   otters are only found on the west coast, indicating that Baby Seal
   Beach is on the west coast, and thus Springfield, in this episode, is
   near the west coast.


>> Loose Ends

Mark Aaron Richey:   Eisenhower was the nation's 35th President, serving
   from 1953 to 1961.

Mark Aaron Richey:  The National Air and Space Museum is NOT located in
   Springfield, but in Washington DC, where it's part of the Smithsonian
   (sp) Museum. Highlights include the Spirit of St. Louis and the
   Wright Bros. first plane.  OFF visited it in [8F01] "Mr. Lisa Goes to
   Washington".

Don Del Grande:  Homer needs to get out more - just about everybody BUT
   Homer knew about the Stonecutters and Maison Derriere...

To my surprise, James R. Curry and Nick Plant both report no cuts on the
   SKY UK version of this episode. I find this mostly strange,
   considering how SKY has been known to censor for much less than
   this...
