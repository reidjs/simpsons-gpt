Channel 6 is right across from the Box factory (1F11) -- which isn't
downtown -- so Kent's new studio _couldn't_ have been looking out on the
town square.  {mk}

Mr. and Mrs. van Houten are in the scene behind Kent as he reads the
news; they're crawling away to our right when the panic begins.  {ddg}

The cable TV cable is strung unrealistically.  {th}

Since when have the Simpsons had cable (recall 7F13)?  {wv}

The Wiggum's bedroom is depicted differently than in 9F21.  {dh}

Chief Wiggum's bedroom TV has both cable and rabbit ears.  {ddg}

If the Wiggums' cable had in fact been ripped out, the screen would have
gone to white noise, not to a recorded message.  {th}

It's morning at the Simpson home yet the Wiggums appear to be going to
bed.  {dh}

Watch the fish tank in the car.  The water in the tank rises above the
top of the tank, but amazingly enough does not spill.  {mk}

SLH's skull is too big to fit through the car window.  {ddg}

The houses behind Homer's head change color.  {smk}

Homer's tires keep smoking long after he completes his turn.  {ddg}

When Homer and Bart originally found SLH, it was at "Springfield Downs",
which is now a horse race track (see 9F19); this time, SLH goes to
"Springfield Dog Track".  {ddg}

Bart's seen "Fuzzy Bunny's Guide To You-Know-What" in 8F22, so he should
know what SLH and STF are up to at the track.  {mk}

The Simpsons used to have a doggie door.  (cf. 7F23,8F14,8F17)

Just before the puppies are born, Maggie eats with her hands; when the
puppies are eating, Maggie has a spoon (but has her pacifier in her
mouth).  {ddg}

A picture vanishes from the fridge door.  {dh}

According to the UFA, Snowball II has had kittens at least once, so
having a pregnant pet should be nothing new.  {mk}

When the puppies start to be born, Maggie disappears from the table.
{ddg}

There are 26 puppies eating out of bowls in the kitchen, yet there
should be 25 only.  {djk}

New-born puppies shouldn't be able to crawl to the front door from the
kitchen.  {dh}

Bart should have known the baby puppies wouldn't do much to Jimbo; he
could have said he was insulting Milhouse.  {th}

Lisa stares down Snowball II when she looks for attention, but she's
Lisa's cat, and it's unlike her to be so unsympathetic to her pet's
emotional needs.  {mk}

There are 27 puppies in Bart's sock drawer, never mind that at least 14
of them were in the shot just before it.  {mk}

Abe's phone has no cord.  {dh}

Mistake or not, there is nothing the Army could do to Homer once they
had discharged him, unless the draft is revived.  When have we heard of
Homer being in the Army anyway?  {th}

Homer is too fat to get into the army in 8F15.  {ddg}

Homer, Marge, and Lisa change position between the scene where Burns is
walking away and the scene where he's piling the puppies into the sack.

Bart should be _very_ against giving the pups to Monty Burns -- remember
what he did to SLH in 8F17?  {mk}

Where are Mr. Burns' attack dogs?  {ddg}

Bart should know his way around Burns' Manor -- after all, he spent
several days/weeks there in 1F16.  {mk}

Burns doesn't have those spots all over his body.  (cf. 7F18.)  {dh}

When Bart and Lisa try to get the puppies into the laundry chute, Mr.
Burns is turning the handle of the door that does not have the keyhole;
this handle usually doesn't turn in double doors.  {ddg}

How could the handle turn more than 180 degrees?  {mk}

The puppies appear to grow a bit after their trip down the laundry
chute.  {dh}

When Mr. Burns points his gun at Bart, Bart's shoes and socks are back
on his feet.  {ddg}

In the early shots of the basement, the back corner near the laundry
chute has a washer and dryer, but in some later shots, the washer turns
into a water heater.  {mk}

Using a gun would create lots of holes in the puppies' pelts and render
them pretty useless for making his tuxedo.  {mk}

Burns' gun vanishes when he falls to his knees.  {dh}

If all 25 dogs were champion racers, why didn't Homer make a fortune
betting on them?  {ddg}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Tim D. Rice: I thought tonight's episode was great.  We got the Snowball
    II footage we've been clamoring for, and the slamming on Disney
    still hasn't grown old.  But who the heck is "Rory Calhoun"?

S. Rubin: Although the end was a bit too rushed and zipped up, this is
    one of the best of recent shows.  I hope this is an indication of
    things to come.  Thanks for making me laugh again.

Keith Bailey: I have to agree the puppy episode was very strange.  It
    felt as if new writers who didn't know much about the show wrote it.

Dairenn Lombard: They made three disney refs (indicative of an
    experienced Simpsons writer), plus they had only minutes to wrap up
    a pretty long and probably better-if drawn out episode.  The only
    thing is that it was fundamentally empty though had plenty of nice
    visual gags, jokes and good puns.

Tony Hill: Absolutely fabulous!  There are no words for this episode.
    It is definitely the best of this season, and IMAO it ranks up with
    any of the best of the early seasons as well.  This episode was a
    laugh riot from blackboard to fade to black.  I hope we haven't seen
    the last of Santa's Girlfriend.  A+ and a star!

Christine Tiplady: The "Greyhounds" episode was Bad.  By the end, the
    showdown between the kids & Burns, I wasn't even cracking smiles.
    And overall it just Wasn't Good -- what was it ABOUT?

Ken Scudder: Am I the only person who was disappointed with tonight's
    episode?  There wasn't much laugh out loud humor, and they didn't
    seem to let the characters do what they're good at.  It could be me,
    but I don't think this is a good episode at all.

William Vaughan: It was pretty average.  Some of Bart's comments were
    funny and the "new" news studio, but overall, there wasn't much
    there -- liked Burns' song though.

Marc Singer: The obviousness of the gags was particularly annoying.  Are
    they getting paid by the lame joke now?  I think the writing has
    just gotten abominable.  The first new episode in weeks, and it was
    this crap?

J. Seacs: I can't say this episode was my favorite, but I did LOVE
    Burns' musical number.  It really brought life to a rather drab
    episode, as did the song and dance number in Monorail.

Matt Braun: Well, all in all, I thought the episode was pretty weak
    (with the exception of bart's commentary on what SLH was doing to
    the other dog...that was classic.)

Josh Goldfoot: This episode had the potential to turn into something
    absolutely awful, and it did.  Puppies?  I'm supposed to laugh about
    puppies?  I haven't seen so much commercialized cuteness since the
    Care Bears.  I think we were all rooting for Burns.

David Rosen: Last night's episode is one of the worst of the year.  The
    episode is fairly representative of the inferior product that the
    Simpsons' writers have been grinding out all season.  What happened
    to this show?

Paul Lee: Well, I enjoyed it, although I am partial to any episode that
    features "that oddly lovable sadist" C. Montgomery Burns.  Granted,
    it wasn't one of the most uproarious episodes of the season, but it
    was a solidly average Simpsons, in that I smiled frequently, but
    really didn't need to bellow "BWAH HAH HA HA!"

Warren Hagey: This was one of my least favorite shows of this season.
    There were a few small laughs, and Burns' song, but other than
    that...The whole first act I kept telling myself that they were
    building up to something, but soon enough the end credits were
    rolling, and I still hadn't seen what they were building up to.  C-.

Don Del Grande: B -- it was a B-plus to begin with, with a lot of laughs
    almost making up for a single-minded story, but that entire last act
    with Bart and Lisa trying to free the puppies was as predictable as
    the end of the "MacGyver" episode Sideshow Bob saw that almost
    canceled his wedding with Selma.

Rendell Bird: The "See My Vest" section is the only thing that keeps
    this episode from being at the bottom of my list.  As it stands, it
    is only beaten by _Marge Goes to Jail_ and _Homer's Odyssey_.  My
    rating: D+.

Aaron Varhola: Yuk!  Dare I say Yeardley was right?  This show was way
    too cartoony.  A number of funny gags, and the puppies were cute,
    but the plot was way too implausible; the characterization of OFF
    was weak, and Burns was way out of character, evil instead of
    callously amoral.  I give it a D.

John J. Wood: I don't blame Aaron for his reaction -- I wasn't fond of
    the episode, and my favorite part was clearly the Homer potato chip
    scene.  While the 101 Dalmations references were cute, as was the
    Today show reference (the intro), most of the The Simpsons acted out
    of character, and especially Burns!  Grade: C.

Matthew Kurth: This wasn't an episode of "The Simpsons", it was another
    cartoon masquerading as an episode of "The Simpsons".  A really neat
    concept, but laden with enough characterization holes to drive a
    truck through.  Just really bad.  What scares me is the fact that
    they did it all on purpose. 6.5/10

Yours truly: A weak episode, to be sure.  I didn't think much of the
    premise, and the cutesy ending mostly made me gag, but the episode
    was saved by the very clever song (which was even better because of
    the parody) and the whole Rory Calhoun thing.  I give it a D+.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Ray Stevens

Tony Hill says, "Ray Stevens, a noted satirist (as opposed to a
    parodist) had a number one hit in 1974 with `The Streak,' a paean to
    a then-popular phenomenon.  Among his other hits were `Shriner's
    Convention,' `Ahab the Arab,' `Would Jesus Wear a Rolex (on His
    Television Show),' `Mama's in the Sky with Elvis,' `Everything Is
    Beautiful' (his biggest and only serious hit), and my personal
    favorite, `Jeremiah Peabody's Poly-Unsaturated, Quick Dissolving,
    Fast Acting, Pleasant Tasting, Green and Purple Pills.'"

>> 25 puppies?

The Guinness Book of World Records says the largest litter of puppies is
    23.

>> Bob Barker

Tony Hill writes, "Bob Barker has spent four decades as a game show host
    (`Truth or Consequences,' `The Price Is Right'), but has gained
    notoriety of late due to sexual harassment allegations by a former
    game show model."

>> David Brenner

Tony Hill explains, "David Brenner is a comic and was a frequent guest
    host for Johnny Carson in the late 70s.  He once had a bit with dog-
    like mannerisms.  His career waned when he tried to launch a late-
    night talk show against Carson."

>> Rory Calhoun

John Chaneski writes, "Rory Calhoun is (was?  He's either still alive or
    died in the past 6 or 7 years) a movie actor.  He was in about 60
    films in my Cinemania, including `How to Marry a Millionaire'
    (1953), `Night of the Lepus' (1972), `The Main Event' (1979),
    `Angel' (1984) and its sequel `Avenging Angel' (1985, natch), and
    the schlock horror classic `Motel Hell' (1980).  I remember him as a
    tall, gangly galoot.  Kind of an older Sam Elliot."  Tony Hill adds
    that he started in "The Red Horse" (1947).

Marge: Ooh, this place is so big.  Do you think we should split up and
       look for him, Homey?  Homey?
Homer: [at a ticket booth] Two bucks to win on number eight.  [sees
       Marge looking at him] [plaintive] And have you seen my beloved
       dog?  [laughs painfully] Gimme the ticket.
-- Homer succumbs to Gamblor, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% In the stands, the family are seated to watch the race.

    Homer: We can't lose!  Look at the name of the dog I bet on.
    Marge: "She's The Fastest"...Homer, I don't think that means
           necessarily --
Announcer: And they're off!  She's The Fastest jumps out to an
           insurmountable lead.
    Homer: You're lucky you got looks, Marge.
Announcer: As they round the far turn, it's She's The Fastest, followed
           by Always Comes in Second and I'm Number Three.
    Homer: Yes!  Come on, you little horse!
Announcer: And they're in the home stretch.  It's -- wait!  Another dog
           is on the track.
     Bart: It's Santa's Little Helper.
Announcer: The mystery dog is gaining fast on the outside.  Of course,
           he could never win this race...or could he?
            [SLH chases the lead dog]
     Lisa: What's Santa's Little Helper doing to that dog?
    Marge: Uh oh...
     Bart: It looks he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite
           make it.  Come on, boy, you can do it!

% The announcer mourns.

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end: the end of dog racing.
 Everyone: Boo!
    Marge: I think they're in love.
 Everyone: Aw...
            [the dogs lie contentedly on the track]
    Homer: Aw, so _that's_ what's been wrong with the little fellow: he
           misses casual sex.
     Lisa: Can we keep Santa's girlfriend, Mom?
     Bart: Please?
    Marge: But she's not our dog.
    Texan: She's yours now.  Once they fall in love, they lose their
           racing spirit.
    Marge: Won't you miss her loyalty and companionship?
    Texan: [guffaws heartily] Lady, you're all right.
-- I don't get it, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

       [SLH paws at the front door]
Marge: OK, you can go out and play, but no more you-know-what in front
       of the house, all right?
        [the dogs run out]
       Hey!  What'd I just say?
-- Time for obedience school once again, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% The two dogs go for a stroll.  The butcher puts a steak out on a plate
% for them, as does the video store clerk and an older woman in the park
% who pulls a steak from her purse.  They even get their photo taken
% with their heads poking through a cardboard cutout of the "Dogs
% Playing Poker" picture.  On their way to Luigi's restaurant, they spy
% a wrinkled dog and laugh to themselves.  The generous chef puts a
% plate of spaghetti and meatballs in front of them, saying "Take it: it
% fell on the floor."  The two start slurping up the same strand of
% spaghetti, and when their lips meet, they snarl at one another and
% fight over the strand.

% At the Simpson dinner, the dogs lie on the floor in the kitchen.

 Bart: Hey, boy, you want to play fetch?
        [SLH looks up, tired, then puts his head back down]
       Aw.  Me and Santa's Little Helper used to be a team, but he never
       wants to play any more since his bitch moved in.
Marge: Bart, don't ever say that word again!
 Bart: Well, that's what she is.  I looked it up.
Marge: Well, I'm going to write the dictionary people and have that
       checked.  Feels like a mistake to me...
-- Marge "Tipper Gore" Simpson, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% "Hey, look!" observes Bart, "a really small dog just fell out of
% Santa's girlfriend."  Marge gasps, "Oh my God!  She's having babies.
% Oh, I'm sorry, girl, I thought you were just getting fat."  Lisa
% exclaims, "Look!  It's twins."  Homer adds, "No, it's two sets of
% twins!"  Bart continues, "Two sets of twins and a triplet!"  Marge
% exhorts Homer to find places for all these little miracles.  They put
% them in a baseball hat and glove, in a shoe, in a barbecuing apron, in
% the coffee, tea, and sugar containers, and in Marge's hair.
%
% "Oh, my, I've never seen anything like this!" says Marge.  Lisa
% wonders how many more there can be.  The family counts 22, 23, 24, as
% the clock spins ahead by hours and the family continue to look on.
% The final tally? 25.  The last one goes in an oven mitt on the
% refrigerator, which slides down to the floor under the weight of the
% adorable miracle.

% {The puppies sit, assembled on the kitchen floor.}

 Lisa: {Wow, 25 puppies!}

 Bart: {An army of dogs!  No bully will ever touch me again.

% The humans and puppies eat dinner at the same time.  The puppies all
% have personalized bowls, from "Rex" and "Fido" all the way down to
% "Prince" and "The puppy formerly known as Prince".

Marge: Oh, Homey, aren't they adorable?
Homer: Yes.  We've waited many years, but the good Lord has finally
       blessed us with a real family.
        [Bart, Lisa, and Maggie glower at Homer]
-- Meal time for people and puppies alike, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% The family and the puppies all watch TV.  A woman in a bikini suns
% herself on a boat, and one of the puppies gets up on its hind legs and
% paws at the screen.  Marge chuckles, "Look at Branford II!  Isn't that
% cute?  He thinks he's one of the Models, Inc.!"  The family join in
% their laughter.  Snowball II, listless, tries the same stunt as
% Branford II, only to be rebuked angrily by Homer: "Get that cat out of
% the way!"
%
% The next morning, Bart puts on some clean socks, only to have them
% attacked and shredded while they're on his feet.  He goes to the top
% drawer to get some more, but it's full of puppies who tear and shred
% with equal vigor.  Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Marge attaches a collar
% to Lisa.

 Lisa: Mom, why do _I_ have to wear a flea collar?
Marge: Oh, it's just easier this way.
-- The simple way out, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% Homer opens a bag of chips in front of the TV, but each time he pulls
% one out of the bag, a puppy jumps up and snatches it from his hand,
% eliciting a "D'oh!" every time.  Marge walks into the kitchen later.

Marge: Yeesh, this house stinks!  You're not just putting the new
       newspapers over the old ones, are you?
Homer: Do you have a better idea?
-- Well yes, actually, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% Marge breaks some bad news to the kids.

    Marge: Now, I know we love the puppies very much, but I think
           they're getting to be a problem.
     Bart: Yeah, they ate all my socks.  I have to wear Lisa's to school
           today.  [Bart's socks are pink]
    Homer: How do you explain the coulottes, boy?
     Bart: [wearing a pink skirt] Well, I have to coordinate, don't I?
    Homer: Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies
           away.
Bart+Lisa: No!
    Homer: Mainly your mother.
     Lisa: Is that what we do in this family?  When someone becomes an
           inconvenience, we just get rid of them?

      Abe: [picking up phone] Hello?  Is anybody there?  Aw...[hangs up]
-- Lisa, rhetoric queen, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

   Marge: All right, we'll give the dogs one more chance.  As long as
          the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay.  Hmm.  On
          a completely unrelated topic, I'm having a very, very
          important dinner party tonight.
   Homer: Splendid!  Who's coming?
   Marge: Reverend Lovejoy, your old army drill sergeant, and the
          regional director of the IRS.
           [that night]
 Lovejoy: Oh, just lovely, Marge.  The whole town will hear what a
          perfect evening this was -- how nothing at all went wrong.
Sergeant: Simpson!  This evening has gone so flawlessly, I'm going to
          forget that you were mistakenly let out of the army a month
          early.
 Auditor: And I'm so impressed by this problem-free evening that there's
          no need for that audit.
 Togther: A toast...to the Simpsons!
Sergeant: And to that delectable turkey...that's walking around the
          table?!
 Lovejoy: Dear Lord, it's a demon-bird!

Sergeant: Simpson!  See you at reveille, 0500 tomorrow.
 Auditor: See you at the IRS!
 Lovejoy: See you in hell!  [slams door, then pops head back in] From
          heaven.  [slams door]
-- The dinner goes horribly awry, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% Homer hammers a sign into the ground in the front yard: "Puppies for
% free (or best offer)".

    Ned: Well, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the
         Flanderosa.
Skinner: It'd be nice to have some companionship when mother goes out on
         dates.
    Abe: We could use a new pet over at the home seeing as how we
         accidentally killed that smart-mouth bird.
-- At the puppy giveaway, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% The remaining puppies howl upon seeing some of their litter being
% taken away.

    Lisa: They don't like being broken up.
   Marge: We've got to be realistic, kids.  Who's going to have a big
          enough heart to take care of 25 puppies?
   Burns: [chuckling] And I know the little fellows will love romping
          around my many acres, chasing my many cars, drinking from my
          many toilets...
   Homer: Who wouldn't?
    Lisa: [whispering] Mom, don't give the puppies to him, he'll be mean
          to them.
   Marge: Hmm...she's right, Homer.  There's something about his face I
          don't trust.
           [Burns laughs evilly to himself]
   Homer: Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but...you can't have these dogs.
          [cringes] Am I fired?
   Burns: Hmm?  Oh, of course not.  They're your pets, you can do as you
          wish.  Good day, everyone.
           [he starts to walk off with Smithers]
   Marge: My, he certainly took that well.
   Homer: A little too well, if you ask me.  I'm sure he's plotting some
          brilliant scheme to get those puppies.
           [Burns piles them into a sack while the family's backs are
          turned]
   Burns: There you go...there you go...you go, too.
Smithers: Honestly, Sir, you just don't put the effort into your schemes
          that you used to.

% The police are called in to look for the missing dogs.  Lou eats a
% donut while Chief Wiggum looks half-heartedly around the kitchen.

Wiggum: Don't worry, folks, we'll find your wallet.
 Marge: Dogs!  Chief, you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor.
Wiggum: No I'm not, no I'm not.  I'm, um, dusting for prints.
 Marge: Oh.
-- Advances in police science, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% Bart and Lisa decide to use the puppies' parents as trackers.  The two
% dogs run off, only to drag Bart and Lisa back when Marge puts out food
% for them and calls, "Dinner time, dogs!"  Chief Wiggum is apologetic:
% "I'm sorry, kids, I don't think we're ever going to find your
% greyhounds.  Maybe Mr. Burns will sell you one of the 25 he got last
% night."

% Bart and Lisa sneak off to the Burns Manor that night as the thunder
% roars.  They hear yapping from an upper-floor window, and Lisa
% shudders, "Who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent
% little puppies?"  They climb a trellis and peek in a window to see
% Monty bathing them all and laughing.  "Ah, there.  Now wasn't that
% heavenly?  And don't you feel better too?"  Lisa expresses surprise.

          [Burns takes the puppies out of a bath]
   Burns: There you are...there you go, little fellow...and you.
           [one of the puppies stands on its hind legs]
           [gasps] Smithers, look: he's standing up.  I've never seen
          anything so adorable!  Do you know who it reminds me of?
Smithers: Benji?
   Burns: No.
Smithers: Lassie?
   Burns: No, no, no, a person.  You know who I mean.
Smithers: Snoop Doggy Dogg?  Bob Barker?  David Brenner?
   Burns: No, no!  The person who's always standing and walking.
Smithers: Rory Calhoun?
   Burns: That's it!
-- Twenty Questions, Monty style, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% Monty picks up the obedient dog: "You stay with me; you're the pick of
% the litter."  Lisa reconsiders her position: "Maybe we were wrong
% about Burns on this one."  The two children shuffle along to the next
% window and watch.

Smithers: Are you sure you want to go through with this, Sir?  You _do_
          have a very full wardrobe as it is.
   Burns: Yes...but not completely full.  For you see...
           [singing] Some men hunt for sport, others hunt for food,
          The only thing I'm hunting for is an outfit that looks good.
           [to the tune of "Be Our Guest"]
          See my vest, see my vest, made from real gorilla chest,
          Feel this sweater, there's no better than authentic Irish
          Setter.
          See this hat?  'Twas my cat.  My evening wear?  Vampire bat.
          These white slippers are albino African endangered rhino.
          Grizzly bear underwear; turtles' necks, I've got my share.
          Beret of poodle on my noodle it shall rest;
          Try my red robin suit, it comes one breast or two,
          See my vest, see my vest, see my vest!

          Like my loafers?  Former gophers!  It was that or skin my
          chauffers,
          But a greyhound fur tuxedo would be best.
          So let's prepare these dogs --
   Woman: Kill two for matching clogs!
   Burns: See my vest, see my vest, oh please, won't you see my vest?
           [spoken] I really like the vest.
Smithers: I gathered, yeah.

% Lisa is aghast.

Lisa: He's going to make a tuxedo out of our puppies!

Bart: Sorry.  You gotta admit, it's catchy.

% "Come on, Smithers, let's go finish the little flea circuses off,"
% sneers Monty, exiting the room with his obsequious sidekick, "except
% for little Monty, of course."  Bart sweats, "We gotta get the dogs out
% of there!" and opens the window.  The puppies bark happily at him.
% "Shh!  Hush, puppies!" he whispers.  "We gotta get you out of here,"
% worries Lisa as she and Bart run to the door and look through.  Burns
% loads and cocks a handgun in the next room.

Bart: I know, the window.
Lisa: No, Bart!  What are you doing?
Bart: Dogs always land on their feet.
Lisa: That's cats.
Bart: No, it's dogs.  I'll prove it.

      Best two out of three.
-- The children try to rescue the hounds, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% The doorhandle slowly turns.  Lisa spies a laundry chute, and Bart
% tries to encourage the puppies to go down it, but they won't.  Lisa
% gets an idea: she removes Bart's shoes and tosses his socks down the
% chute.  The puppies follow faithfully just as Burns walks in.  "Sorry,
% Monty, but you're too big for this ride," taunts Bart, following Lisa
% down the chute.

 Lisa: Quick!  Let's get the --
Burns: Going somewhere?
 Bart: That's impossible.  How did you get here first?
Burns: Oh, there'll be plenty of time for explanations later.  Right
       now, I'll be taking my puppies back.
 Lisa: But they're ours.  You stole them from us!
Burns: Here's a phone.  Call somebody who cares.
        [Lisa dials 911]
       Give me that!
-- Threats taken literally, "Two Dozen & One Greyhounds"

% "Now if you'll excuse us, children," continues Burns, "the pups have a
% date with a fashion knife."  Bart resourcefully grabs Burns' puppy
% from his arms and puts it with the rest.  "There.  Now you don't know
% which one's little Monty.  If you don't want him to be part of your
% tuxedo, you'll have to let the other dogs go too."  Burns sees through
% this one: "Come on, little Monty, stand up.  Stand up!  Do your
% trick."  The children beg him not to, to no avail.  "Excellent," grins
% the sinister C. M. Burns.
%
% Bart looks around frantically, and spying some underwear and socks
% hanging on a clothesline, gets an idea.  He wheels them over the dogs
% heads as Burns says, "Now it's simply a matter of bending down and
% picking up the one and only --" The dogs, true to form, stand up and
% reach for the socks.  "This can't be happening!  They're all standing.
% I can't tell them apart."  He sighs heavily.  "All right, you win:
% I'll have to kill them all."  Bart and Lisa protest.

    Burns: But they're so wretchedly adorable. 25 little Rory
           Calhouns...I can't do it.  But I can kill you.
            [Lisa whimpers like a puppy]
           No, I can't kill you either.  Look at you, standing there on
           your hind legs like a couple of Rory Calhouns.
            [Lisa and Bart sigh]
     Lisa: Well, Mr. Burns, I hope you've realized the folly of killing
           innocent animals for fashion.
    Burns: [repentant] Oh, I have, I have!  I swear I will never wear
           any clothing made from an animal.  [to himself] That can do
           an amusing trick.
            [a long time later]
Announcer: Another victory for Montgomery Burns' champion greyhounds. 25
           dogs, 25 world champions which so far have earned their owner
           over ten million dollars.  I'll bet whoever gave him those
           dogs is kicking themselves now.

           dangling]

    Homer: [grunts] Marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the
           only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million-
           dollar greyhounds.
