       # One specific scene in the first act caused a lot of turmoil -- and
       # surprise -- when it aired in syndication. It seems that FOX censored
       # it prior to its airing, but too late for other stations to do the
       # same. It was intact on CFCF 12 (Montreal), and most probably on
       # Global as well.
       #
       # The first report came from Mr. Livingstone <accw55@glen-net.ca>:
       #
       #    It looked like instead of seeing SLH running when the cut was
       #    made, extra footage was put in where you see him running, then
       #    rising when running, then a zoom out to see him on top of STF
       #    without moving his front legs.
       #
       # Aaron Varhola (avarhola@ix.netcom.com) added:
       #
       #    Hmmm... I think you Canadians have looser morals police than us.
       #    Actually, the scene showed even more than that in its pencil test
       #    and original format. David Silverman showed the original
       #    uncensored versions when he spoke in San Francisco on June 1. Fox
       #    rejected three different cuts before they decided on the one shown
       #    in the U.S. I think you got the original one or one of the closer
       #    ones to the original.
       #
       # After everybody got the chance to witness this scene on syndication,
       # Don Del Grande commented:
       #
       #    In the dog race, when SLH is catching up to She's the Fastest,
       #    originally they just showed SLH running down the track and then
       #    cut to Bart, Lisa and Marge in the stands - but in the syndicated
       #    version, they showed SLH not only catching up to She's The
       #    Fastest, but getting on top of her (well, they only showed the
       #    heads, but clearly SLH was on top of STF).
