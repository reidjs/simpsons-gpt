The comic book guy's desk is in a different place in 7F21.  {rl}

There are no buildings near the Capitol Records Tower which are taller
(production meeting scene).  {th}

How could Dirk Richter have been the star of the "campy 1970's"
Radioactive Man series?  In "3 Men and a Comic Book", we saw him as the
star of the 1950's-era series (sponsored by Laramie Cigarettes).  {by}

Young Moe's cap falls off his head, yet it reappears on his head in the
next shot.  {dh}

The Little Rascals are pushing 80, which Moe certainly isn't.  {th}

Skinner's microphone disappears from his office.  {dh}

Bart is a lot farther away from the window than usual in class.  {ddg}

The Hollywood Brown Derby never looked like a derby.  The one which did,
on Wilshire Boulevard, was partially torn down by the owners in the
middle of the night in 1981 to stop the city from saving it.  What was
left was incorporated into a strip mall and was occupied by a Middle
Eastern restaurant last time I noticed.  {th}

The "Hollywood" sign is farther east than shown in the finale.  {th}

The girl with green glasses has clear lenses in class.  {ddg}

"Little Rascals" wasn't called that until it was syndicated.  (see
below) {by}

Snake's tattoo is on the wrong arm.  {dh}

The position of the boys waiting in line changes between scenes.  {dh}

Nelson's reflection in the mirror is wrong.  {dh}

If Bart is so good, why doesn't the director just put him in padded
shoes?  {ddg}

Bart's pencil vanishes after he measures his height.  {dh}

Bart misattributes the line about show business (see comments section).
{ar}

Fallout Boy doesn't wear glasses -- why would they keep Milhouse if he
had to wear them?  {ddg}

$30 million isn't much of a budget for an action movie.  {ddg}

How did the Van Houtens buy all that stuff so soon after the
announcement?  {ddg}

Milhouse's stunt double has the wrong kind of glasses -- the frames
aren't as thick in the front.  {ddg}

Milhouse's pants disappear from Wiggum's hand.  {dh}

A cup-and-string phone doesn't work unless the string is taut.  {ddg}

The Capitol Records Tower is right on Vine Street just north of
Hollywood Boulevard.  {th}

Mann's Chinese Theatre is not on the Vine corner.  {th}

The Hollywood Hotel (which is no longer called that) is located on
neither Hollywood nor Vine.  {th}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Scott Fujimoto: I felt the jokes were pretty flat and the story non-
    involving.  A few good bits such as the 70's Batman spoof and that
    Estonian guy, but that's about it.  Also, the animation and voice
    acting were subpar.  If the writers were trying to spoof Hollywood
    movie-making (a ripe target), they totally failed.  Grade: D.

Harry Wareing: Something seems to be missing this season.  There were a
    few funny moment especially the Hollywood sequence at the end, but
    like the first episode it lacked something.  Could it be the writers
    have run out of fresh ideas?  I hope not...

David Smith: Yeesh.  That was about as subtle as a L.A.P.D.
    interrogation.  Only not as funny.  Is it too early in the season to
    choose a "worst episode this year?"

Mark A. Richey: I didn't think this was that great of a show.  Some of
    the movie cliches were funny, and I was impressed that they got a
    "Waterworld" gag in the film so quickly, but overall, it was only
    mildly funny.  I give it a C+.

Bob Yantosca: Definitely a two thumbs up for Radioactive Man!  And now
    the writers have started to make fun of us "obsessive nerds" on the
    Internet as well!

Mark Dallara: Did the entire production staff turn over?  The animation
    was different, the voices were different, and the writing absolutely
    sucked.  I was really looking forward to this episode, but if this
    is the standard for the rest of the season, I'm going to have to
    find something else to do on Sunday nights.

Brad Veenvliet: Many of the reruns that are on all of the time are WAY
    better than the episode that was on tonight.  There were a few funny
    parts, but on the whole, it wasn't that funny.  I hope that they do
    a better job the rest of the season, or the move to Sunday night may
    really cost them a lot of ratings.

Dave Kathman: It was a pretty decent episode with some funny stuff, some
    stuff that didn't work, and a pretty lame ending.  The highlight for
    me was the cheesy '70s version of Radioactive Man -- Fallout Boy
    sounding just like Burt Ward, Paul Lynde as "The Scoutmaster", the
    sound effects, and the go-go dancing at the end.

Don Del Grande: Grade: B. It had a number of good, if overused,
    Hollywood gags, but the ending fizzled out; maybe if they had moved
    the "stunt man in Mrs. Krabappel's class" bit to the end instead of
    before the "Hollywood and Vine" bit, it would have been better.

Jim Smith: I loved this episode.  I always enjoy Bart's trips to the
    comic store, and today was no exception.  Radiation Dude was cool,
    and the "special where Radioactive Man and Fallout Boy die on every
    page" was hilarious.  I think Troy McClure would've been a better
    Radioactive Man, though.

Ricardo Lafaurie: Well, it was okay, but...oh, who am I kidding?  It
    sucked!  Great Batman spoof (Go get 'em, scouts!) and I laughed at
    Rooney's "Jiminy Jillikers", but other jokes were just really
    forced.  The ending was _trash_.  Only "Springfield Connection" was
    worse.  D-

Frederic Briere: An episode should have humoristic, satirical or
    emotional contents; in this case, none of that was present, besides
    the Batman parody, the air conditioning thing, and some other jokes
    that could make you laugh for 5-10 seconds.  Grade: D+.

Greg Lam: Grade: B. The pacing and timing seemed a bit off at times, and
    the acid thing was just much too implausible to do anything for me.
    However, the ending was _perfect_.  A complete twist on the cliche
    big city/small town values shpiel which pervades so many second rate
    plots.  Mickey Rooney had a good guest shot.

Dominik Halas: Merely an average episode.  Some parts, such as the
    Batman parody, had me ROTFL, but too many of the jokes seemed forced
    and predictable.  In addition, the plot didn't appear to have a real
    direction.  Grade: C+/B-

Jose Lafaurie: I've been waiting for this episode since I saw the title.
    After knowing the plot, it made me even more anxious to watch it.
    Then they come up with this episode, that, in the words of the crew
    man, was "a bunch of cats taped together."  Grade: C

Keith Palmer: Although "Radioactive Man" did suffer from a lot of
    outlandish sight gags (such as the hats-flying-off gag), it seemed
    to be genuinely funny within its own narrowly defined limits.  The
    best part was the seventies RM TV show.  Grade: B/B+

Chris Courtois: The first two acts were a great spoof of movie making
    and star-struck small towns, and the "campy 70s TV version" was a
    classic.  But act three fell flat and mainly served to shoehorn in a
    gratuitous celebrity appearance.  A B+ episode knocked down to a B-
    by a weak last act.

Tony Hill: Whoever conceived of an episode based around _Milhouse_?!?
    This would have been a scream had Bart gotten the part.  Instead, we
    got a bunch of gags edited together not much more seamlessly than
    the work for which the film editor was fired.  This gets a D, and
    with good cause.

Yours truly: It had the endearing qualities of all Swartzwelder
    episodes, but for the most part failed to deliver really good jokes.
    Liked the newsgroup jokes, the Batman parody, and McBain's bad
    acting, but not Quimby, Rooney, or the Hollywood jokes.  Grade: D+.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> The animation in this episode

Tom Mannion forwarded me a post from Chris Cammack which stated that
    "Radioactive Man was rendered on a Silicon Graphics (SGI) Onyx
    Workstation with a fancy animation program.  With a SGI reality
    engine as a sever, this computer could animate an episode in Real
    Time!  Don't worry, the software had a modification to emulate old
    fashion animation and they have used test scenes in earlier
    episodes.  This is something of keeping your eyes out for."  Several
    readers commented that they felt the animation in this episode was
    substandard.

>> "Little Rascals"

Several readers point out that the original name of the TV series was
    "Our Gang".  The name was changed only after it went into
    syndication.  As well, Bob Yantosca writes: "The guy who played
    Alfalfa didn't die until he was an adult...he was shot in a dispute
    over $50 when he was in his 40's or 50's."

>> Paul Lynde

Jose Lafaurie writes, "The Scoutmaster looks and talks like Paul Lynde.
    He was a star on the popular `Laugh-In' series of the 1970's, more
    famous for Goldie Hawn.  He was also very effeminate.  In his later
    years, he maintained the center spot in `Hollywood Squares' during
    the late '70s."  Tony Hill adds that he dies in early 1982.

>> Show Business: "Hideous bitch goddess"

Bart attributes this line to George Burns.  Andrew Rose says, "It wasn't
    George Burns who said this, but rather William James, who is quoted
    by Tennesse Williams in his essay The Catastrophe of Success
    (published along with `The Glass Menagerie').  George Burns enjoyed
    a long and (he always proclaimed) enjoyable life in showbusiness,
    and it wouldn't have made too much sense for him to have said it."

>> Mickey Rooney

Ricardo Lafaurie provides some information about the guest star in this
    episode: "Mickey Rooney has been around a long time as a child star
    in the '40s to '50s.  Right now, he plays in various secluded
    movies.  This isn't Rooney's first time to be `tooned' either.  He
    starred in the film `Little Nemo in Slumberland' as the voice of
    Flip.  Coincidentally, Nancy Cartwright also voiced a role in that
    movie, showing up moments before Flip's first appearance."

% At the Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop, Bart and Milhouse
% survey the new superhero comic offerings.

    Bart: Ohh, all these new superheroes _suck_!  None of them can hold
          a candle to "Radioactive Man".
Milhouse: The only decent new one is "Radiation Dude".
    Bart: Nah, he's just a cheap imitation of Radioactive Man.
Milhouse: [put out] Explain.
    Bart: The similarities are subtle, but many.  For example,
          Radioactive Man has his famous catch phrase, "Up and at 'em!"
          with "at 'em" spelled A-T-O-M in a delicious pun.
Milhouse: Go on...
    Bart: While Radiation Dude has a similar but lamer catch phrase, "Up
          and let's go!"
-- Bart compares and contrasts, "Radioactive Man"

% The store owner overhears their conversation.

   Owner: So you kids fancy yourselves experts, eh?
    Bart: Well, between us we've read all 814 issues of "Radioactive
          Man".
Milhouse: Yeah, and we both have the special limited-edition issue where
          he and Fallout Boy get killed on every page!
   Owner: Well I suppose you know, then, that Hollywood is planning a
          feature film about Radioactive Man.

           [their hats shoot up off their heads]

          Man 1: I don't see why Rainier Wolfcastle should be the star.
                 I think we should bring back Dirk Richter.  Kids will
                 want to see the original Radioactive Man.
      Assistant: I keep telling you, he's 73 years old and he's dead.
          Man 1: Granted, but --
       Director: Besides, we want to stay as far away from the campy 70s

           work; it's good -- very, very good.  Van Johnson good.
 Milhouse: I know I'm good.  Movie stardom is just so hollow.
   Rooney: Hollow?!  The only thing in show business that's hollow is
           the music industry.  Come on, Milhouse, you _have_ to do
           this, if not for yourself, then for the moviegoing public and
           for the foreign markets that are more important than ever
           nowadays and...finally, for me -- the Mickster.
 Milhouse: [adamant] No.
   Rooney: All right, I tried.  Fortunately, we have a perfectly good
           Fallout Boy right here.  [puts his arm around Bart]
            [next shot shows Rooney in Fallout Boy costume]
   Rooney: Jiminy jillikers.  Jiminy jillikers.  Jiminy jillikers!
 Director: [covering his eyes] We're shutting down production.
Assistant: Yeah, well, we only have $1000 left anyway.
   Quimby: Uh, there's a $1000 leaving town tax.
-- Good to the last milked drop, "Radioactive Man"

% The town gathers to see the movie folk off.

Rooney: Well, I hope you're all satisfied.  You bankrupted a bunch of
        naive movie folks -- folks from a Hollywood where values are...
        different.  They weren't thinking about the money.  They just
        wanted to tell a story, a story about a radioactive man, and you
        slick small-towners took 'em for all they were worth.
         [everyone looks dejected and mournful]
  Otto: [sniffles] Do we give them some of their money back?
Quimby: [weeps] No.
         [the helicopter swings by overhead]
 Pilot: Hurry, Mr. Rooney!  We've got a disenchanted little girl in a
        Jell-O Pudding commercial!
Rooney: I could play that...[grabs the rope ladder]
-- Always looking out for numero uno, "Radioactive Man"

% In class, Mrs. Krabappel drones on in front of a map of the world.

  Bart: So, Milhouse, it must be a little tough giving up all that
        glamor and coming back to school, huh?
Midget: Quiet!  Maybe I can get my citizenship.
-- All's well, "Radioactive Man"

% In Hollywood, an assembled crowd welcomes back the troubled production
% with open arms.  An actor hugs the assistant and says, "We know you
% don't have any more money left, but that doesn't matter.  Just take
% whatever you need from our boutiques until you can get back on your
% feet."  The assistant sighs, "Thank God we're back in Hollywood where
% people treat each other right."
%
% The camera pans out from Hollywood Blvd. and Vine St., where everyone
% smiles and acts friendly, to the strains of "Lean On Me."
