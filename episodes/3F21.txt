=======================================================================

    Homer goes to Hullabalooza, a rock concert featuring freakish
    sideshow acts, where he displays his special talent: catching a
    cannonball with his belly.  Cartoon cameos include Peter Frampton,
    Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill.

=======================================================================

>> COUCH SCENE

     The couch scene begins in "black light", then Homer turns on
     a lamp and the colors return to normal. {ddg}

     While the black light is on (distortion guitar): {jl}

	 (O1)L8    B> D# F# A#__.

     When the regular light is turned on the harp plays and
     normal music continues. {jl}

   ... Homer calls Christianity "a religion" (as opposed to the number
       of religions that it is)?

       everything they say, instead of the usual mumbling used for
       whispers?
   ... Maggie fell for the second time this season (the first being in

> Comments and other observations
=======================================================================

>> Dinosaur Rock

Benjamin J. Robinson notes, "In addition to the featured bands, we got
    to hear from some classic-rock artists.  `Mississippi Queen' was
    the second song on the radio (the one that Bart switched off in
    disgust).  `Frankenstein,' by the Edgar Winters Group, was playing
    as Homer reminisced about the custom van.  Of course, the song by
    Grand Funk Railroad was, uh, was, say, what _was_ that song by
    Grand Funk Railroad?"

>> If this van's a rockin'...

Benjamin J. Robinson says, "The `Kalifornia Kustom' van fad got its
    start in the '70s.  People would find some hapless van, and outfit
    it with high-end stereo, shag carpeting, and even beds.  Wild
    graphics on the outside provided the finishing touch.  Custom vans
    are still being made, but, like McDonald's, they've grown up.  Now
    they're elaborately, almost formally, decorated, and marketed to a
    middle-age clientele."

>> I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza!

Benjamin J. Robinson notes, "Hullabalooza is (obviously) based on the
    series of alternative-rock tours, Lollapalooza.  [Also based on
    "Hullabaloo" (see above) --ed]  The original Lollapalooza was the
    brainchild of ex-Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell.  Inspired
    by a similar festival in Reading, England (called, `The Reading
    Festival'), Farrell created a touring concert that combined
    cutting-edge music with sixties-throwback politics.  The basic idea
    was to marshall together a group of bands new enough to be cool,
    but not so new as to be completely obscure.  As they spent the day
    playing, concert-goers could just groove to the music, or they
    could go to an alternative `village.'  There, vendors had set up
    kiosks selling everything from vegetarian food, to on-the-spot body
    piercing, to the latest political causes.  The show was a big
    success, and it has since become an annual event.  One year, a
    traveling freak show shared the spotlight with the musicians.  They
    performed weird stunts, many of which would never be able to air on
    a network television show (even Fox) in a million years.
    
"Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins, and (I think) Cypress Hill have all
    played Lollapalooza.  So have other notable alterna-rock bands such
    as Nine Inch Nails, the Breeders, Body Count, L7, and even funk
    master George Clinton.  We're still waiting for Peter Frampton."

>> Face the Music

Benjamin J. Robinson tells me (and thank him, because I don't follow
    the music scene.  It's none of my business.)  "If you don't follow
    the rock music scene, you might not be familiar with all of the
    bands.  Here's some background information on `Homerpalooza's'
    musicians."

"Some music critic once said that hardly anybody bought a Velvet
    Underground album, but that everyone who did went out and founded a
    successful band.  He could just as easily have been talking about
    Sonic Youth; virtually every new band nowadays cites them as an
    influence.  The people who decide who's hip and who isn't have long
    admired Sonic Youth, despite (or because of) the their only
    moderate album sales.  The band is known for their noisy, almost
    atonal songs.  The dissonant closing theme is very Sonic Youth-ian.
    This motif carries over into the bands they admire, too:  when
    guitarist Thurston Moore hosted MTV's `120 Minutes,' he brought
    along clips from acts that he liked.  They were even farther out
    than Sonic Youth, if you can imagine such a thing."  Aaron Varhola
    adds: "Sonic Youth has been rumored to want to do a longer version
    of the Simpsons' theme for one of their albums.  That would make
    the third album the theme was included on.  The other two are Danny
    Elfman's `Music for a Darkened Theatre' and Danny Gratton's `88
    Elmira Street'."

Benjamin J. Robinson: "For the record, the Sonic Youth lineup is:

     - Thurston Moore Guitar & Vocals
     - Lee Ranaldo    Guitar
     - Kim Gordon     Bass & Vocals
     - Steve Shelley  Drums"

"In their March 1994 issue, US magazine described Smashing Pumpkins'
    sound as, `Passionate, richly textured neo-psychedelia.'  You can
    judge the accuracy of this statement for yourself (they don't sound
    _that_ psychedelic to me); Smashing Pumpkins is all over modern
    rock radio.  The song they played was `Zero,' which oddly enough
    was the current single when `Homerpalooza' aired.  Nice timing! 
    Unfortunately, that timing seemed to break down when it came time
    to drawing Billy Corgan.  He's been bald for months now, yet sports
    a full head of hair in this episode.  One of the perils of working
    with a long lead time, I suppose.  Oh, yeah, Smashing Pumpkins is
    made up of:

     - Billy Corgan     Guitar & Vocals
     - James Iha        Guitar
     - D'Arcy           Bass & Vocals
     - Jimmy Chamberlin Drums

    "According to the Smashing Pumpkins FAQ, Mr. Iha pronounces his
    name, `ee-hah.'  You can access the FAQ at `http://www.engr.wisc.
    edu/~agnew/sp-faq.html'.  It's designed to look best with Netscape
    2.0.  An all-text version is at `http://www.engr.wisc.edu/~agnew/
    sp-faq.txt' if your browser doesn't have the requisite bells and
    whistles."  Nick Navas adds that Billy Corgan is reported to do a
    good imitation of Homer and Marge, hence his "Woo-hoo"ing in this
    episode.

"I was less successful in finding information on Cypress Hill.  As you
    could probably tell, they're a rap band.  They've enjoyed big
    success with their single, `Insane in the Brain.'  In addition to
    Lollapalooza, I remember the group performing on `Saturday Night
    Live.'  Cypress Hill's biggest claim to fame so far is their
    fiercely pro-marijuana-legalization stance; the band has been very
    activist in promoting this cause on and off the stage.  This
    explains why most of the drug humor in this episode is attached to
    them."

    "As the credits indicate, Cypress Hill is B-Real, D.J. Muggs, and
    Sen-Dog.  I'm not Cypress Hill-literate enough to tell who mans
    what position, however."

"Peter Frampton was a big guitarist and singer in the mid-'70s.  He's
    best known for (of all things) a live album, `Frampton Comes
    Alive,' which featured such hits as `Show Me the Way.'  This
    episode featured the live version of `Do You Feel Like I Do.'  I
    don't think he's done anything earth- (or chart-) shattering
    lately; like a lot of '70s acts, he's in a `permanent nostalgia
    tour' mode.  On the other hand, David Bowie did pick him to play
    guitar on the Glass Spider tour."  John Westergaard adds that
    Frampton's guitar said, "I want to fV(& you" on "Frampton Comes
    Alive" version.

>> I'll give Gen X-ers the helping hand they deserve: the iron fist!
 
Aaron Varhola notes, "Burns' remark was interesting.  A couple years
    ago, Pearl Jam sued Ticketmaster, claiming anti-trust violations;
    Pearl Jam wanted to market tickets for its tour at a flat $20, but
    Ticketmaster insisted on adding `service charges' to the price.
    The band members ended up testifying before Congress, but no anti-
    trust action was taken.  BTW, Pearl Jam turned down the chance to
    be in this episode; the line would have been more ironic had they
    been in the episode."

>> That Smooth Carolina Smoke

Don Del Grande says, "The `Skoal Bowl' is probably a reference to
    tobacco companies having to find `alternative' ways to advertise on
    TV since tobacco commercials (cigarettes in 1971, all forms
    sometime in the early 90s) were banned on television in the USA.
    (For example, a number of tobacco signs appear on scoreboards that
    would show up when a baseball player is rounding first base and is
    shown in a close-up.)"

>> The Wormy Apple

The "Suicide Notes" clerk doesn't know about Apple Computer.  Veronica
    Marquez rambles, "Apple Computer was a company pioneered by Steve
    Wozniak and Steve Jobs out of their garages.  Since 1979 they have
    catapulted into computer fame with the Apple II series and the
    Macintosh computers.  But lately the company has been falling
    apart.  Steve Jobs left Apple because of disputes about the Mac 
    and formed his own company, NeXT.  He made veeery sloow computers
    using the UNIX system and a clunky graphics interface.  [Which is
    what I have at school.  --ed]  They had no color at first, but by
    the time they released a color NeXT, it was too late, and the
    company bowed out of the business in 1995.  The once-president of
    Apple (can't recall his name, but they recruited him from PepsiCo)
    tarnished the name of the company, and the Apple II series has been
    discontinued.  Sales of Macs continue to be low today, despite
    numbers of people who continue to be loyal (including myself.)
    Things look bleak for Apple Computer."

>> Slo-Mo Shot of Homer in his first Cannon Experience

That is a reference to something, but I don't know what.  A '94
    Skittles commercial featured stock footage from the '40s and '50s,
    and one of them was a B&W shot of a big guy being shot with a

Jason Hancock says, "Styx (one of the groups whose record Homer found
    in the `oldies' section) was a Chicago-based rock band of the late
    seventies and early eighties.  Its well-known tunes include
    `Renegade', `Blue Collar Man', `Too Much Time On My Hands', and
    `Mr. Roboto,; a song Homer quoted from in `Team Homer' (3F10)."

>> Freak Show!

Philip H. Carver says "If I am not horribly mistaken, then this whole
    sideshow thing is in reference to Jim Rose's travelling sideshow
    freaks, who did/do tour with Lollapalooza...Not so sure about a
    cannon man, but Jim Rose nails nails in his nose, and was seen in
    the beginning of the concert..Also, for you X-Files fans, the
    episode where the man who has a puzzel of a globe tattooed on his
    body also travels with this group, and his name is The Enigma...if
    you were curious.."

Abba... a mediocre foreign pop band that has a cult following... and

"The Alan Parsons Project consists of Alan Parsons (mostly renowned as
    a producer, and engineer of the Beatles' `Abbey Road' and Pink
    Floyd's `Dark Side of the Moon') and Eric Woolfsonm as well as a

    concept albums beginning with `Tales of Mystery and Imagination:
    Edgar Allan Poe' and are probably best remembered for their songs
    `Eye in the Sky' and `Don't Answer Me'.  Though the group has its

=======================================================================

Dale Abersold - To paraphrase a line from the episode, "Homerpalooza"
    isn't about writing or characterization.  It's about marketable
    guest voices.  It was saved from a failing grade only by its rips
    on corporate America and its drug jokes.  C-.

Tom Baker - Not bad at all.  I liked it.  But ... it was painfully
    obvious I was watching a "cartoon", not something that could
    really happen. [...] Besides, I don't like Generation X jokes.
    That term doesn't seem to apply to the young people *I* know.
    I give this a B.

Shawn Berry - I thought this episode was kinda mediocre. I give it a C.

Frederic Briere - Well... I didn't feel very comfortable watching
    Homerpalooza, as if it were a party and I wasn't invited.  After
    all, it was meant as a gift for the fans of all those bands
    mentioned throughout the episode; since I don't know most of them
    and don't care for the others, I don't think I have the right to
    comment the musical part of it. As for the "true" Simpsons part,
    which made roughly a third of the episode, it was above average,
    making Homerpalooza still enjoyable for me.  GRADE: C+

Chris Courtois - "Homerpalooza" was the sort of episode that has been
    rare lately, one that improves on multiple viewings. The first time
    through I was overwhelmed by the "look-at-all-the-cool-guest-stars-
    we-got" aspect and ranked the episode a high C.  But the second
    time around, I remembered all the genuinely funny bits scattered
    throughout the episode. Lots of spoofing of the whole Lollapalooza
    music festival scene. When the episode focused on satire, it was
    quite good. It was less interesting when it was trying to come up
    with stuff for the myriad guest stars to do. Fewer guests would
    have improved the show. Still, as ratings ploys go, it was better
    than it needed to be. Final grade: B.

Don Del Grande - B-plus - the only things I didn't really like about
    this episode were (a) the lack of "things happening" when Homer was
    on the tour (it was "stop at a town, Homer takes a cannonball in
    the stomach, stop at another town, Homer takes another one in the
    gut, etc."), and (b) the telegraphed "Homer chooses his family"
    ending.

Jeff Gustafson - Well, it wasn't that good, but not that bad either.
    This episode had a few laughs, but I feel it was upstaged by 
    "Summer of 4 ft. 2".  Grade: B-

Dominik Halas - Episodes in which rock groups guest star (Flaming
    Moe's, The Otto Show) are usually excellent, and this was no
    exception.  This episode had lots of great lines from Homer, a good
    flashback, and dead-on satire of today's teenage culture.  Grade:
    A-.

Jason Hancock - To quote Braves announcer Skip Caray, "It had a home
    run cut, but it came up empty" -- especially after all this hype.
    I'm not a big fan of alternative music to begin with (and I'm 20
    years old), but the whole idea of Homer trying to be a part of
    Generation X just didn't work for me.  A generic ending didn't
    help either.  Grade:  D.

Lawrence Lam - This was an okay episode, didn't interest me too much.
    I didn't see "The world is a vampire." "It is? AAAAAA!!!!" Wasn't
    Barney supposed to be Smart before his Beer-years? It didn't seem
    to like it. Who are these bands that Homer talks about? I give it a
    B-.

Norman J. Landis - "Homerpalooza" was a bit flat in parts and the real
    musicians when given speaking parts showed why they should stick
    with music and forego a career in voiceovers.  Still, any savage
    satire, as this was, is OK by me.  Plus I finally got a new sig! 
    Thanks Grampa!!!!  My grade: A-

Haynes Lee - The Simpsons finally meet Generation X. A great season
    finale. But what about the Yellow Album?  GRADE: A

John Westergaard - [responding to above] I totally disagree.  D+.  All
    jokes fell flat (IMHO)  Except the "Otto's jacket" one.

Veronica Marquez - The Gen-X stabs were right on the money and the
    guest voices didn't mind making fun of themselves.  It sounded
    like it was going to be terrible but it turned out to be
    wonderful.  I give it an A+.

John Murray - Overall this was only an okay episode, while it did do
    well at the gen X parody it seriously lacked any of the Simpsons
    trademark ROFL lines that the great episodes have.  Even the guest
    stars didn't really make me like this episode any better.  Also the
    gen X parody, was funny at first but about halfway through it just
    got old.  Grade:  D-

Ryan Pederson - The Season Finale was okay, the part with Homer in the
    car talking about jive was pretty funny and I also enjoyed the
    Cypress Hill jokes.  Otto triping on acid was funny.  The show is
    really turning into a show for oldering teens.  The flash back
    scene with Homer was classic.  The show seemed to get off on a
    great start, but after Homer goes to the concert it goes downhill.
    But the none-stop jokes seem to have disappeared from the show
    entirely.  Nevertheless still very funny, but this episode was too
    hyped up.  They could have made better jokes with all the guest
    stars on the show.  B

Jeff Reis - I gotta say I liked it, though it did have its weaknesses--
    the perfunctory guest shots, the abrupt ending, several flat gags.
    I feel like more could have been done with such ripe material, but
    this was an above average effort in spite of itself. [...]
    Anyway the lame stuff/good stuff ratio was at least 50/50 here
    (probably better) and that makes it one of the season's stronger
    episodes. It's almost a B-, but I'll give it the benefit of the
    doubt and a B.

Benjamin J. Robinson - Good bands and great spoofing of the modern-rock
    scene combine to make "Homerpalooza" a kickin' tale.  The best part
    is that the highlight is _not_ the soundtrack -- it was the way the
    writers poked fun at their guest bands. Peter Frampton, especially,
    had a great cameo -- right up there with Ringo Starr's appearance
    several years back.  Well, Dick, "Homerpalooza" had a nice beat and
    you could dance to it, so I'll give this one an A-.

Mark Richey - I'm not much of a fan of alternative music (my music
   tastes actually run closer to Homer's), so this episode really
   didn't work that much for me.  I enjoyed the ruthless satire of
   Lollapalooza, and I did get most of the jokes involving the various
   bands, but it could have been much funnier.  Grade:  C+

Terrance Scanlan - The act I found had no storyline, and Otto's dream
   at the beginning sorta threw it off, and if Homer knew that
   Hullabalooza was coming to Springfield why didn't he wait til then
   to take Bart and Lisa.  But what really made me smile was the idea
   of Homer being a stuntman (and what his stunt was), it really made
   Homer shine, unlike Homer Defined.  Grade: ***,  B+,  8/10.

Devin Tuffy - A somewhat lame plot but helped with some good laughs
   (most involving Cypress HIll) and lots of great Gen-X and
   alternative music scene (?) slams.  B-

Aaron Varhola - Tight writing and a lot of ROTFLMAO lines; the bands
    did a good job of parodying themselves, especially Cypress Hill.
    The opening seemed forced, and the end was a classic "moment of
    uh...crud", but the rest of the episode held together well as both
    satire and touching family comedy. I liked Bart's report topic,
    touching and nicely understated. A/A-.

Yours Truly - "Homerpalooza" surpasses "The Otto Show" at spoofing
    rock and roll, and takes lots of stabs at Generation Xers.
    Certainly there will be a few that are offended, but that's their
    own damn problem.  I liked this episode, and give it a B.

AVERAGE GRADE: C+/B- (2.78)

 Bart: What religion are you?
Homer: You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't
       work out in real life. Uh... Christianity.
-- "Homerpalooza"

% Homer wonders why all those questions, but Bart avoids the subject by
% saying it's "just some report [he's] gotta do for school", and offers
% him a piece of pie. While he's away, Homer takes a look at Bart's
% paper, which is about the person he admires most: his father. When
% Bart comes back, they eat their pie silently, sharing this moment,
% but the rumbling from Homer's stomach reminds him of the price he
% could pay.

% At Springfield Fairgrounds, the family is allowed access to the
% backstage of Hullabalooza.

Guard: Clear the way, clear the way! Performer coming through.
Marge: This is so exciting. Last time I got to go backstage was when
       Bart ripped his pants at the Christmas play.
 Bart: Mom...
   DJ: [pointing to Bart] Ha-ha!
-- Cypress Hill takes a cue from Muntz, "Homerpalooza"

% Once backstage, it's time for the last-minute preparations...

Who is playing with the London Symphony Orchestra? Come on people,
somebody ordered the London Symphony Orchestra... posssibly while high.
-- Backstage at Hullabalooza, "Homerpalooza"

% Most signs point at Cypress Hill, so they take the orchestra:

       DJ: Uh, do you know "Insane in the Brain"?
Violinist: [British accent] We mostly know classical... but we could
	   give it a shot.
	    [hip-hop music, gradually accompanied by the orchestra]
	   "Put the water on the flame, boiling temper"
	   "Just toss that ham in the frying pan like spam..."
-- Mmm... spam, "Homerpalooza"

% On stage, Peter Frampton uses a synthesized voice to create the
% illusion that his guitar "talks" while playing.

     Jimbo: Man, that guy's guitar is talking.
      Otto: Hey, my shoes are talking too!
 Left Shoe: Don't worry. We won't hurt you.
Right Shoe: We only want to have some fun.
-- "Homerpalooza"

% There are even some spectators you wouldn't expect...

   Burns: [chuckles] And to think, Smithers: you laughed when I bought
	  TicketMaster. "Nobody's going to pay a 100% service charge."
Smithers: Well, it's a policy that ensures a healthy mix of the rich
	  and the ignorant, sir.
-- Burns attends Hullabalooza, "Homerpalooza"

% Back on stage, Frampton's having some problems with his show, as his
% "pig" pedal doesn't do anything.

Frampton: God. Homer Simpson wrecks my pig, Cypress Hill steals my
	  orchestra, and Sonic Youth's in my cooler! Get out of there,
	  you kids!
   Moore: Aw, come on, Mr. Frampton. You're not gonna eat <all> that
	  watermelon.
Frampton: Please, I'm trying to perform!
 Shelley: Go ahead. We'll stay here and guard your cooler.
	   [they all dig in]
-- "Homerpalooza"

% Discouraged, Frampton leaves the stage to Homer.

And now, Springfield, this is the moment that you've been waiting for,
the man who embodies everything about Rock 'N' Roll, except the music.
-- Introduction, "Homerpalooza"

% The crowd cheers their homegrown hero like no one else; even Milhouse
% is proud to state: "I used to carpool with that guy".

Oh, this is heavy. Okay Homer, don't fear the reaper.
-- "Homerpalooza"

Marge: Cannons are designed to hurt. They're <designed> to <hurt>.
 Lisa: Shh! Mom, dad needs our support.
Marge: [smiles to Homer]
 Bart: You're the coolest dad alive!
-- He won't stay both for very long, "Homerpalooza"

% As the cannon fuse burns, everybody is paralyzed in anticipation of
% Homer's stunt, even Sonic Youth who have stopped eating their
% watermelon. Ultimately, Homer dodges the cannon, to the disappoint-
% ment of the crowd.

I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but all I wanted was a
club sandwich.
-- Homer, after "wussing out", "Homerpalooza"
   
   Homer: Oh, Marge. I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but
	  all I wanted was a club sandwitch.
   Marge: There might be one in this cooler.
	  [digs in Frampton's cooler] Oh, here you go.
Frampton: Ohh!
-- "Homerpalooza"

Oh, man. Homer wussed out. I'm so disillusioned.
-- Lee Ranaldo, "Homerpalooza"
 
Hullabalooza isn't about freaks; it's about music, and advertisement,
and youth-oriented product positioning.
-- Kim Gordon, "Homerpalooza"

 Gordon: Hey, Hullabalooza isn't about freaks; it's about music, and
	 advertisement, and youth-oriented product positioning.
Sen-Dog: That, and getting toasted. Nicely toasted.
-- "Homerpalooza"

Manager: Homer, I'm sorry. There's nothing worse than a yellow-bellied
	 freak... unless that's his act. I expect your letter of
	 resignation on my desk.
  Homer: You have a desk?
Manager: I mean, the hood of my car.
-- "Homerpalooza"

     Homer: I'll miss you, Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak
	    world view. I've got too much to live for.
    Corgan: We envy you, Homer. All we have is our music, our legions
	    of fans, our million of dollars and our youth.
	     [pause]
	    Woo-Hoo!
       Iha: Let's all go out and buy fur coats!
Chamberlin: I want a walk-in humidor.
-- So much for _that_ plan, "Homerpalooza"

% In the car, on the trip to go home, Homer concludes his adventure:

    Homer: So, I realized that being with my family is more important
	   than being cool.
     Bart: Dad, what you just said was powerfully uncool.
    Homer: You know what the song says: "It's hip to be square".
     Lisa: That song is so lame.
    Homer: So lame that it's... cool?
Bart+Lisa: No.
    Marge: Am I cool, kids?
Bart+Lisa: No.
    Marge: Good. I'm glad. And that's what makes me cool, not caring,
	   right?
Bart+Lisa: No.
    Marge: Well, how the hell do you <be> cool? I feel like we've tried
	   everything here.
    Homer: Wait, Marge. Maybe if you're truly cool, you don't <need> to
	   be told you're cool.
     Bart: Well, sure you do.
     Lisa: How else would you know?
-- "Homerpalooza"
