    ... the obligatory mouse hole in the corner?
    ... Marge and Homer were uncredited?

Obviously, you freeze-frame the burps.

> Assorted comments and observations
===============================================================================
The stage left door has a rounded top (like in the half-hour show) but the
stage-right door has a flat top.

Brian Howard {bh} gives the timing for this short as 1:54, whereas the
syndication package contains only 1:32 of animation.

%
% Close-up on Lisa as she takes two sips of her soda and also burps.
%
% Marge bursts in the stage left door.

M: What are you kids doing now!
B: We're having a ... [burp] contest, Mom.

% Lisa nods in agreement.

M: What?
L: We're having a burp contest, Mom.

% Lisa holds up her can of POW Cola to illustrate.
%
% Marge scolds the kids by shaking her index finger.

M: Well, knock it off.  I do not allow burping in this house.

% Marge storms out.

B: I love Mom...
L: But ...

% Bart takes a gulp of soda and burps.  Lisa does the same.

B: The show must go on.

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:31]
%
% Lisa burps just as Bart takes huge swig of cola.  Marge bursts
% in the door, leaving Bart stuck with the soda in his mouth.  Although
% Bart's mouth is shut, we can still make a pretty good guess at what
% he's saying.

M: Bart!
B: [his mouth shut] What?
M: What did I say about burping?
B: [shrugs, his mouth shut]  I dunno.

% During the lecture, Bart's cheeks puff up, and tiny bubbles emerge
% from his ears.

M: I said, no burping.  And when I say no burping, what do I mean?
B: [his mouth shut]  No burping.
M: That's right.  No burping.  I know you won't disappoint me.

% Marge finally leaves, and Bart lets loose a huge burp that knocks
% him on his back.  Lisa and Maggie applaud.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:50]

B: Watch this.  The burp champion of the world.

% Bart takes a huge sip and emits a belch.  Marge bursts in.

M: Burp, I mean, Bart, are you burping again?
B: Maybe.
M: What is it with this burping?  Why?  What's the thrill?
L: It's fun.
M: It's crude.  It's vulgar.  It's, it's impolite.  And, and it's nauseating.

% Marge leaves.

L: That's what I said.  It's fun.
B: I'm still the burp champion of the world.

% Maggie removes her pacifier and produces a high-power belch.

L: Bart, meet the new champ.

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 1:03]

B: Watch this!

% Bart takes a sip and burps twice.  Lisa takes a sip.

L: Oh yeah?

% She burps thrice.  Once again, Marge burps, I mean, bursts in.

M: How many times do I have to tell you kids?
   I absolutely forbid burping in this household.

% Homer comes in the stage right door, in his hand a can of what we presume
% to be some of that wonderful Duff.

H: How's it goin', everybody?

% Homer gives a monster belch.

H: Oops.  Pardon my French, heh heh heh.
L: Thanks, Dad.
B: Good one, Dad.

% Marge can only watch, disappointed.  Maggie burps.
%
% (Cut in syndication:  After Maggie burps, Marge looks at all of them,
% stunned.)
