===============================================================================
% B = Bart, L = Lisa
%
% The kids (from left to right: Bart, Maggie and Lisa) stand in the
% upstairs hallway.  Behind Bart is a green vase.  In front of Lisa
% is a white saucepan.

B: I've got a great idea.  Let's play Space Patrol.

% Lisa puts a saucepan on her head.

L: I'll be Lisuey, the devil-may-care rocket pilot.
B: And Maggie can be Magina, your spunky sidekick.

% Maggie pops up into frame, a small white saucepan on her head.

L: And you'll be...

% Bart places the vase on his head, which falls down, completely enclosing
% his head.  (*thud*)  Muffled tones emerge from Bart through the remainder
% of the scene.

L: ... Bartron, the evil robot from Mars gone berserk.

% Bart flails his arms and loses his balance.  (*thwump*)
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:18]
%
% Bart is back on his feet, but he's still flailing his arms, and muffled
% tones continue to spew forth.  Lisa and Maggie are wearing red capes
% (towels) in addition to their saucepans.

L: I, Lisuey, see my lovable sidekick Magina in mortal danger of
   being liquidated by the horrible robot from Mars.

% Bart, in his confusion, has wandered onto Maggie's cape.  Lisuey grabs
% Magina (Maggie gets a quizzical, borderling strangling, expression)
% and gives her a yank.  Bart falls onto his back as a result.  Lisuey
% then drops Magina to the floor.  (*thwump*)

L: Perhaps next time, you will resist your evil ways, Bartron.

% Magina rises into frame, none the worse for her brush with death.
% Bart is flat on his back, still muttering.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:34]
%
% Bart is back on his feet, his arms still outstretched at odd angles.
% Lisa is at stage left, Maggie at stage right.  Each girl has a broom
% in her hands and pokes Bart with the wooden end.  Bart continues to
% talk lmmmke thmmmph.

L: Calm thyself, Bartron, and tell us where the magic space crystals
   that can save the galaxy are hidden.

% Lisuey and her spunky sidekick continue to poke the mysterious Bartron,
% who just says ``Mmmfmmmphfhmmpfm''.

L: Speak American, Bartron.  We earthlings understand not the Martian tongue.

% Cut to the top of the stairs.  Magina pokes her head through a doorway
% as Bart wanders confused towards the landing.  She sticks out her
% broom, tripping Bart down the stairs.  (*thump* *thump* *thump* *thump*)
%
% Angle from the bottom of the stairs.  Bart lies on the stairs, the vase
% still stuck to his head, stars and spirals streaming from his head.
% Lisuey and Magina admire their handiwork from the top landing.

L: Magina has rendered Bartron's anti-gravity belt non-functional.
   Hail Magina!

% Lisa salutes.  Maggie raises her hand in salute, but loses her balance
% and falls (*whump*) on her face.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 0:59]
%
% Downstairs in the living room.  Maggie stands in front of the couch,
% Bart slightly to her left (our right), and Lisa to Bart's left.
% Maggie salutes repeatedly.  Lisa holds a mallet in her hands.
% Bart tries (unsuccessfully) to remove the vase.  The muffled tones
% continue.  The end of the couch nearest Maggie has been pulled a few
% feet away from the wall.

L: Do I understand you correctly, Bartron?
   Do you wish me to release you from the helmet of evil thoughts
   with my enchanted space wand?

% Bart raises his arms and tries to say `Yes, yes, yes!', but it comes out
% more like `Mmph, mmmph, mmmmmph!'.

L: I will do it, Bartron.  But who knows what mysterious forces will be
   unleashed!

% Lisuey smashes the helmet.  Bart's face is disfigured, his eyes askew.

L: Oh no, inside the evil Bartron is a horrible mutant boy.

% Bart staggers, dazed.  Lisuey and Magina have sought refuge behind the
% couch.

L: [whispering]
   We'll be safe here 'til Mom and Dad, the evil overlords, get home.

% [End of Act Four.  Time: 1:26]
