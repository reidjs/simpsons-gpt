         Marge: No... we can't start thinking that way about our own family
                members. Suspicion could tear us apart.

       ! Taken from The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular:
       !
       ! "To keep this bombshell secret, the producers animated several
       !  solutions that were never intended to air. [...] And to keep the
       !  show's animators, editors, staff, and hangers-on from leaking the
       !  solution, two completely different endings were produced: one real,
       !  one phony.  Here's the ending you were never meant to see."

       # Smithers: [pained]  Noo! Wait a minute: yes.

            Burns: With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on
                   top of the world. So I wanted to kick up my heels and
                   indulge my sweet tooth.

         Flashback to Burns walking toward parking lot:

            Burns: I feel like celebrating.  [sees Maggie]
                   Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about?
                    [she smiles, holding up a lollipop]
            Burns: [gasps] I see.

            Burns: Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take candy from
                   a baby. But with him out of the picture, I was free to
                   wallow in my own crapulence.
       #           Or so I thought -- but at the last moment, Smithers, drunk
       #           as a lemur, lurched out of the darkness and fired.
|0:16| # Smithers: [remembering] That's right. Right before I shot Jasper.
       #           Hmm, I was busy that night.
            Burns: Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid, but finding
                   only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the
                   sundial.
             Lisa: Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W
                   and S:
|0:02| #           "Waylon Smithers".
            Marge: Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've
                   recovered and that we can all get back to normal.
       #    Burns: Not exactly. Smithers, for attempting to kill me, I'm
|0:11| #           giving you a 5% pay cut.

         Homer: We're here. We're queer. We don't want anymore bears.

         Homer puts on his safety glasses, takes place in front of the cannon,

       # Dave Hall talks about many interesting outtakes:
       #    Actually, if "disenchanted" fans really wanna know: Lisa's
       #    "out-of- character" behaviour was neatly explained in the original
       #    script, but for time constraints some "minor" scenes were cut from
       #    the final episode. Most notably were more scenes involving Lisa's
       #    classmates deliberately avoiding her and one really cool scene
       #    where Lisa sees Bart hamming it up, impressing the others, and she
       #    asks what the secret of being popular; Bart replies:
       #
       #    "Lis, a frog named Petey once taught me that somethings can't be
       #    taken apart without dying."
       #
       #    Too bad this scene was cut, I personally think leaving this one
       #    scene in would have made the entire episode make more sense, IMHO.
       #    It would have also explained why Bart was so bothered by Lisa
       #    "imitating" him to make friends.

       % Marge: [growls]  It's called Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport. It's
  <19> %        known as America's scrod basket.
       %  Bart: I thought _Springfield_ was America's scrod basket.
       % Marge: No, Springfield is America's crud bucket. At least according
       %        to Newsweek.

         They drive by Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport's welcome sign.

        #   it never happened.  (It may have looked different because she was
        #   wearing a hat.)

   ~~
        # The ad for this commercial also revealed two more outtakes, being:
        #
        # The Val-U-Mart clerk offers Homer the neutron cherry bomb: "It
        # destroys hands, but leaves smiles intact." Tom Baker attributes
        # this as a reference to the neutron bomb, "which kills people but
        # leaves buildings intact".
        #
        # Homer throws the M-320 in the oven, and this is where it explodes.
