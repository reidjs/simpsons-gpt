Couch:          The room is upside-down. OFF run in on the ceiling and sit
                down on the couch, until they fall to the "real" ground.

   ... The pictures of Birch Barlow and George C. Scott on the wall at the
       restaurant?
   ... Bart can jump surprisingly far and accurately?
   ... The dam burst didn't seem to hurt the city at all? (At least not
       Evergreen Terrace?)

       7:55 AM?

> Movie (and other) references
==============================================================================
   + "Brother from Another Planet"  {dga}
      - title (see also "Brother from the Same Planet" [9F12])

   + "Frasier" [Now who said, "Well, Duh"?]
      - Cecil and Bob are voiced by David Hyde Pierce and Kelsey Grammar
        respectively, who play brothers Niles and Frasier Crane on the show
      - in "Frasier," the Crane brothers both have upper-crust mannerisms; the
        same is true of the Terwilliger brothers in this episode
      - a brief "title card" is used to introduce the second act, much like on
        "Frasier" (the music is the same, as well)
      - Cecil's upbeat apartment with the cityscape in the window is similar
        to Frasier's  {dk}
      - the David Hyde Pierce character refers to Maris, the unseen wife of
        Niles Crane
      - the promotional advertisement for this series features Bob and Cecil,
        with Bob saying, "Mother had hopes of us becoming prominent
        psychologists, you know."; on "Frasier," Grammer and Pierce play
        psychologists  {mar}

   - "Jailhouse Rock"  {bjr}
      - Krusty plays rockabilly tunes while in the slammer, like Elvis in this
        movie

   - Johnny Cash  {dc}
      - Krusty is wearing all black a la Johnny Cash;
      - He's doing a prison benefit, and Johnny Cash does a lot of prison
        benefits (or used to, anyway)
      - He's singing in a range that's closer to Johnny Cash's than Elvis' (or
        what I assume would be Krusty's natural range, for that matter).
      - He's sitting in a chair, not doing "moves" like the comeback special-
        era Elvis would have.

   + "Amazing Grace"
      - Sideshow Bob sings this in the prison chapel

   + "Ban the Bomb"  {ddg}
      - "Ban the Bob"

   + "Batman"
      - While confronting Sideshow Bob, Bart says to Lisa "Get 'em Lis'". The
        ensuing few seconds of music is the same as from many Batman fight
        scenes.

   + "Top Of The World" by the Carpenters
      - Cecil sings a bit of this while preparing to blow up the dam

   ~ "Catch-22"  {ce}
      - The part where Chief Wiggum tells Lou he'd promote him to sergeant is
        pretty much a direct quote from this book.

==============================================================================
=  In the opening shot of Krusty's special, there is an aisle right in front
   of Krusty, that disappears in the closeup shots.  {mar}

+  Up until 3F08 (3F07 in production order), Springfield's prisoners wore
   blue. In 3F08 and all subsequent eps, they wore orange. Now they're in blue
   again.  {mss}

=  Everyone in the Visiting Room dissappears after Bob sits down.  {dk}

+  Springfield Prison was called "Springfield State Penitentiary" in previous
   episodes.  {jh}

=  Wiggum's badge switches sides after Bob's release.  {dk}

=  In the first shot of the back of the protesters, Sideshow Mel and Otto are
   seen, but they aren't in the front shots. And in the closeup of Bob getting
   into Cecil's car, Barney and Jasper can be seen, but they aren't in the
   long shots of the car driving up and pulling away.  {mar}

=  During Bob's speech, Rev. Lovejoy moves from behind Bob to stand with the
   protesters, to back behind Bob.  {mar}

=  When Bob and Cecil are eating dinner, their glasses keep changing between
   champagne and wine glasses.  {ljs}

*  Why would Springfield need both a hydro dam and nuclear plant? (If the
   hydro power is a replacement, since when does Springfield care about the
   environment? Besides which, Mr. Burns would probably put a stop to it...)
   {sb}

=  At the Pimento Grove, Bob's fork moves from his right to his left without
   him touching it.  {dk}

=  When Bart tells Bob he'll be watching his every move at the Pimento Grove,
   Bart's wine glass mysteriously has red wine in it where milk was
   previously.  {sf}

=  The first time we see Bob's office, a clock appears, and a light switch
   dissappears.  {dk}

=  Bob is wearing a watch when he discovers Bart and Lisa in the trash bin,
   but it's gone when he drops the children off at their house.  {mar}

*  Even if the cement was hollow, hitting it still shouldn't have caused it to
   collapse.  {sb}

=  After Bob slaps the concrete wall, most of the rubble disappears.  {sf}

=  The wooden board Bob used to plug the turbine doesn't show up until Bob
   runs to the stairs; it then is on the left side of the guardrail in one
   shot, and changes sides when Bob picks it up.  {ljs}

=  When SSB yells "Come on, quickly now!" to Bart and Lisa at the dam, the
   stopped turbine behind him temporarily restarts.  {dj}

=  At first glance, the hole Bob and the kids use to try to escape from the
   Turbine Room isn't as wide as it should be in order to hold all three of
   them, but from inside the tunnel, there's room to spare.  {dk}

=  The number of dynamite sticks changes; originally there were ten, then
   eight as Cecil is about to blow up the dam, then seven after SSB grabs
   Bart.  {jh}

*  Why didn't Bob just cut off the dynamite when Bart was attacking Cecil?
   [But then, Bart would be dead, so I guess it was the right thing to do... -
   -ed]  {sb}

=  When preparing to throw Bart from the cliff, Cecil's shoes are peeking from
   the edge, but from Bart's point of view, he's standing on a fenced balcony.
   {ljs}

=  When Bart is thrown over the edge of the gorge, he's a lot farther from the
   dam than when Bob catches him.  {ddg}

*  In the long shot of Bob falling while hanging onto the end of the dynamite,
   he shouldn't be able to reach Bart.  {ddg}

+  Milhouse managed a fall from the top of a dam in 1F17 without getting hurt.
   {ddg}

*  Bart and Bob would have been flying at such a high speed when they collided
   in midair, they would have been killed. Furthermore, they would have
   smashed back into the concrete wall -- a common occurence among bungee
   jumpers.  {sb}

*  Cecil, the clever mastermind that he is, planned to blow up the dam while
   standing right on top of it, just before Bob snipped the wire.  {dk}

=  As Bob and Bart are hanging, you see a pipe just below them. [Actually,
   it's not *right* under them, so I guess they missed it and hit another pipe
   further down --ed]  {sf}

*  The second time Bob and Bart fall, they fall for about 10 seconds, so they
   should be travelling fast enough to be killed by the sudden stop caused by
   Bob hitting the pipe.  {ddg}

=  When the dam bursts, it is beige; before that, it was always gray.  {ddg}

*  When the wave approaches Evergreen Terrace, it is more than wide enough to
   hit the houses on each side, yet no houses are affected.  {ddg}

*  The water is enough to wash Ralph's bed down the street, yet not a drop
   leaks into OFF's house.  {sb}

*  Why is Ralph in bed in what is presumably the middle of the day?  {dp2}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  If this is the final Sideshow Bob episode, then at least
   the series went out with great panache. Though it seems impossible to
   imagine a non-evil Sideshow Bob, the bickering between Bob and Cecil was
   priceless. The usual cockamamie plot and hilarious situations make this the
   season's single funniest episode.  (A)

Greg Bigoni:  I liked the way that the show opened by recounting SSB's
   previous escapades without resorting to those same tired flashbacks again,
   while also giving some light parody to those impersonal celebrity
   "interviews" that can be seen on just about any talk show. From there,
   though, the storyline became lost. SSB reached such a peak of insanity in
   last year's (much better) appearance, bringing him back to sanity so
   quickly came off as awkward to me. David Hyde Pierce did a fine job, but
   unfortunately, the character of Sideshow Bob has started to get a tad
   uninteresting. If they do bring him back again, I hope it's in a completely
   manic storyline, because this one just didn't do it for me.  (B-)

Stephan Bonneville:  I have a strong objection to this whole disgraceful
   episode. Firstly, the writers stripped Sideshow Bob of his appropriate
   character and turned him into some kind of heroic figure. When we finally
   started to feel pity for him, they banished him back to prison in a totally
   humourless ending. Cecil was an empty and boring character for a poor
   appearance, and besides the good scene with the slack-jawed yokels there
   was little to laugh about. The plotline was sketchy and mediocre at best,
   compounding the general frustration that the writers have hit a dead end
   with Bob.  (D-)

Richard Bunnell:  I was told 3 hours early by someone in the Eastern time zone
   that this episode would suck, but I was wrong, IMHO. I enjoyed the episode
   like I have any other Sideshow Bob one, with many good lines- "I think I
   wet my bed!" "I hope Bob fed you because I ate both your dinners" and such.
   I liked the way they got Bob back in jail at the end, even though I
   expected it to happen. However, it wasn't CONSISTENTLY funny the whole
   time, since a bunch of it was the same joke about Bart stalking Bob.  (A-)

Jesse Burgheimer:  The annual Simpsons tradition of another Sideshow Bob
   episode is probably not the best one featuring SSB, but it certainly is a
   decent one. Cecil, Bob's brother and voice of David Hyde Pierce (of NBC's
   overrated "Frasier") is the best part of this episode, but only because
   Kelsy Grammer did a rather mediocre job playing Bart's other mortal enemy.
   He wasn't the polite but sinister mastermind that is continually thwarted
   by Bart and Lisa, but instead a bitter, unentertaining jerk.
      But while SSB wasn't very entertaining, the episode was. From Homer's
   poor attempt at comforting Bart to Bob and Cecil's "diabolical scheme,"
   4F14 was worth the wait.  (B+)

Don Del Grande:  It was your typical "average" episode (which I usually rate a
   B), but there was just something about that "Bob saves Bart from plunging
   to his death" ending that didn't sit right.  (B-)

Steve Frayne:  Wow Sideshow Bob sure makes for a great episode.  I really
   liked the introduction of Cecil for this episode as he provided a real
   change of pace, but hopefully the two won't cook up a scheme together for
   next season but rather Bob will be back to his evil antics by himself. Bob
   being moralistic this time really threw me as it was very late in the show
   before I realized Bob was actually legitimate. I kept waiting for him to
   turn on Bart but it never came to pass. As far as this ranks among other
   Bob episodes, I still like the original the best. I also prefer the nuclear
   bomb scheme and the run for mayor, but every Bob episode is well above
   average and I just can't wait until next year's perfomance.  (A-)

Timothy Goddard:  It was great to see David Hyde Pierce and Kelsey Grammer
   together in a Simpsons episode, and I enjoyed the role reversal (Sideshow
   Bob as a homicidal maniac was beginning to get tiresome). The couple of
   Frasier references were good, as was Ralph's only line. The show was
   engaging and effective for the third time in as many weeks.  (B+)

Jason Hancock:  This was probably the worst of the Sideshow Bob episodes. Much
   of the story -- especially the third act was slow -- although the show
   improved toward the end with Ralph's cameo. I also liked Bart's line,
   "Please, God, kill Sideshow Bob."  (C+)

Ryan Johnson:  This frasier crossover turned action adventure, was not the
   worst episode ever, but it was pretty close. The good, kind bob didn't
   work, and his brother playing a sinister mastermind out to destroy the town
   didn't work either. The writers need to save these action episodes for a
   spinoff series. I don't want to see Bart and Lisa look through dumpsters,
   sneak through offices, run around a hydroelectric dam and then save a city.
   The show can sink much lower after the "America's Funniest Home Videos" Bob
   saves Bart ending.  (F)

Diego Kontarovsky:  Excellent episode. Great lines, such as "Oh, great.
   Whenever a woman passes by, I suppose it will be my job to lead the
   hooting. 'Oh, yeah! Shake it, madam. Capital knockers!'" and "_Especially_
   Lisa. But _ESPECIALLY_ Bart." The similarity to the Crane brothers'
   bickering whenever the Terwiligers fought was hilarious; we need more
   episodes like this one.  (A+)

Matthew Kurth:  Cute, but it wasn't that funny.  A little of the Frasier
   parody went a long way.  (C+)

Jeff Miller:  Though I still agree with the many on this newsgroup who say
   "Cape Feare" was the best in the SSB series, I have to say I thought
   tonight's was the second best. When the episode started, I looked for the
   writing credit, and when I saw it was Ken Keeler I thought, "Oh, no, this
   isn't going to be funny." (I still haven't forgiven him for that George
   Bush crapola) But luckily, I sat back, watched, and enjoyed a great episode
   chock full of the stuff that makes Simpsons the funniest show on
   television.
      I plan to watch this one on my tape again in a few weeks just to make
   sure I didn't see this one as so good just because it was redemption for
   last week's unwatchable "Homerphobia", but honestly, I think this one will
   stand the test of time.  (B+)

Blaine Moller:  Any episode with side show Bob is usually pretty good and this
   was no exception, great episode. It was surprising to see Bob as the good
   guy this time around. I think we'll be seeing more of Side show Bob and
   Cecil in the next season or so. The possibilities are endless. Good story
   line and a good cast of characters. Also the first time I've seen ralph
   wiggum in awhile.  (B+)

Nate Patrin:  Now this is strange... very, very strange. I tried hard to laugh
   at various points in this ep, but I didn't. Yet when it ended, the first
   thing I thought wasn't "Gee, that sucked" but rather "Hm. Interesting".
   This show succeeded because the story and character development caught me
   and actually made me interested in seeing how it ended. The Frasier/Niles
   to Bob/Cyril bit was, while far too evident, amusing when dropped into such
   a bizarre context. As for Bart and Lisa's roles, they were their usual
   Sideshow Bob-ep selves- i.e. a bit too Scooby-Doo-ish. Not like I care
   _too_ much...  (B-)

Werner Peeters:  When I first read what this episode was about, I thought: 'Oh
   no, another Sideshow Bob episode'. Somehow, the SB episodes all have the
   same story (Bob goed after either Bart, either Krusty or both), but somehow
   the forced temporal Bob/Bart partnership *worked*! Nevertheless, the Bob
   formula is wearing off, and the makers should maybe consider to give Bob
   the same treatment as Poochie! I mean, this is the sixth or seventh Bob-
   episode, right? That's enough!  (B)

Abhi Ray:  Yes! This episode was worlds better than "Sideshow Bob's Last
   Gleaming" but can't beat "Cape Feare". It was the first great episode in a
   while. There were a lot of great scenes and quotes: (Ralph wets his bed,
   Bob dating Krabbapell, Cletus, Homer's failed attempt to comfort Bart,
   Millhouse, the sigh in between screaming) The story worked well enough for
   me, although I liked Bob better as an evil maniac. Maybe next year, he'll
   become himself.  (A-)

Mark Aaron Richey:  Great.  The producers go to all that trouble to get David
   Hyde Pierce to play Sideshow Bob's brother, and then what? They turn Bob
   good? Who saves Bart's life?? By turning into Indiana Jones?!!? I guess the
   writers were so busy in thinking of good deeds for Bob that they forgot to
   put in many jokes. Ho-hum. Maybe next year, Bob will be evil again. Bring
   back Cecil, too (both Pierce and Kelsey Grammer were quite good,
   considering), and have them team up to do something evil and funny, like
   this episode should have done in the first place. No wonder Fox scheduled
   it opposite the broadcast premiere of the best and most important movie of
   the 1990's (which I was smart enough to stick with, leaving this
   disappointment to 10:30 PM)  (C-)

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Just when you thought the Sideshow Bob series had
   nowhere to go, they come up with a few new twists. In addition, this new
   entry features nice interactions between Sideshow Bob and his brother
   Cecil, and between Bart and Lisa. The resolution isn't as satisfying as I'd
   hoped it would be, but otherwise this is a good entry in the Sideshow Bob
   series.  (B)

Matt Rose:  All in all a pretty good episode. I was laughing at a few things
   (most notably Ralph) and I really liked the new twist to an old story (i.e.
   Bart vs. Sideshow Bob). I bet a lot of recent detractors find the 'Bob as
   the good guy' story as a total paradox but it doesn't bother me. It's
   funny, watching this I almost *felt sorry* for Sideshow Bob at the end
   which gives me a feeling that the episode was a little incomplete. Maybe if
   the show goes another year we may see what happens. At least they made
   Chief Wiggum look stupid in the process which I found somewhat funny.  (A-)

Donni Saphire-Bernstein:  I thought this was another great episode. Geez, I'm
   an easy judge- I haven't disliked a single episode this season, apart from
   Homer's championship bout and Ned going crazy. Still, this was a hilarious
   episode. I am SO HAPPY that they finally let Sideshow Bob stay good. Cecil
   was hilarious. The scene with Quimby arguing with Leroy was hilarious. I
   found Bart's continuous persecution of SB to be irritating; yeah, yeah, we
   get the joke. For the most part, the episode flowed quite well.
      In my humble opinion, well done!  It's always funny to see Cletus, no
   matter what they have him doing or saying. Sideshow Bob, as always, is a
   hoot as he rants and raves against Springfield's denizens. Chief Wiggum had
   me rolling at "crazy Lisa Simpson". The plot was good; at the very least,
   the writers didn't trot out that tired old "SSB tries to destroy
   Springfield or kill someone" shtick. Instead, they turned it on its ear and
   seemed to be making fun of the whole "evil SSB" thing.  (B+)

Liam J. Scanlan:  Up high with 4F05 and 4F11, but not the best of the season.
   Grammer is still his usual best and DHP was excellent and the Frasier refs
   were good too. I wonder what would've happened to Bob if he got of free.
   And what will become of Bob and Cecil? Will the next Sideshow Bob episode
   feature Cecil? Lord knows.  (A)

Sloan Schang:  Well, it's finally come (at least for me).  The very first
   episode of this season which had me literally laughing well into the
   commercials. The jokes were fast and furious, for a switch, exemplified by
   the scene beginning with Cletus saying that there's trouble "down to tha
   ceeement truck" and ending with Bob spinning the pipe segment to reveal a
   glimpse of Bart, crouched on hands and knees, as he rotates agin out of
   sight. Even the home scenes were as they used to be (the exchange between
   Homer, Marge and Lisa after Bart runs screaming up the stairs). Also good
   to see again were some subtle and not-so-subtle literary references - which
   is always a given when Kelsey Grammar is guesting.  (A+)

Marge Starbrod-Simpson:  I think I'm alone on this, but I loved tonight's
   episode. It sure was a pick-me-up from last week's disturbing excuse for a
   Simpsons episode (the second worst ever, BTW). SSB episodes are usually
   pretty good, and this was no excepton. The ending could've been better,
   though.  (B+)

Yours Truly:  I'm rather glad Sideshow Bob gets to leave the spotlight (he
   *is* leaving, right?) in something more glimmering than 3F08.
   Unfortunately, his days of glory are long gone, and I had a hard time
   recognizing our genius mastermind in some parts of this episode. Too bad,
   as he and Cecil really made a good pair, both having many good lines to
   their credit. One could feel the chemestry between Grammer and Hyde Pierce,
   and that alone made this episode enjoyable.  (B-)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Brother From Another Planet

Mark_Aaron Richey:  1984 comedy from writer-director John Sayles (an Oscar
   nominee this year for his brilliant screenplay for "Lone Star") about an
   alien who looks exactly like an African-American man who crashes into New
   York City. Apprently, the staff really likes this movie, since it's the
   second time they've ripped off its title for an episode title (the first
   was [9F12] "Brother From the Same Planet").


>> Writer Watch

Dale G. Abersold:  Ken Keeler's Simpsons career has included the episodes "A
   Star is Burns" [2F31], "Two Bad Neighbors" [3F09], "The Thing and I" from
   this year's Hallowe'en episode [4F02], and "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro
   Homer" [3F24]. Forthcoming from Keeler: next season's "The Principal and
   the Pauper" [4F23]. Keeler was also a writer for "The Critic."


>> "Frasier" is a hit show on the NBC television network

Benjamin J. Robinson:  One of the best series on the air (aside from "The
   Simpsons," of course) is "Frasier." A spin-off of the popular series
   "Cheers," the series focuses on the life of Dr. Frasier Crane, played by
   Kelsey Grammer. (Yes, that's right, the psychologist guy from "Cheers.")
   The premise is that Frasier has moved from Boston to his hometown of
   Seattle. There, he lives with his father, a brusque ex-cop with a bad hip
   who couldn't be less like his son if he tried. A slightly dotty live-in
   therapist helps Frasier care for his dad. One of the principal characters
   on the show is Frasier's brother, Dr. Niles Crane, played by David Hyde
   Pierce. Like the Terwilliger brothers in this episode, the Crane boys are
   kind of uppity (Frasier less so than Niles), and life provides plenty of
   humbling experiences for them.

   Critics were initially skeptical that this would work, but the show's witty
   writing and actors' excellent performances quickly won them over. "Frasier"
   is now one of NBC's more popular shows, and airs (in the United States)
   Tuesdays at 9:00pm Eastern time, 8:00pm Central.


Mark_Aaron Richey:  Bob and Cecil are how Frasier and Niles would be if they
   decided to get wacky hair styles and become homicidal maniacs. The title
   card that began Act II is similar to the cards that flash up during
   "Frasier" episodes, giving titles to individual segments. And Maris is the
   name of Niles estranged, never-seen, very wierd wife.


>> Gimmicky Guest Voices

Dale G. Abersold:  David Hyde-Pierce was an obscure character actor (see him
   in such films as "Sleepless in Seattle" and "Nixon") until he was cast as
   younger brother Niles Crane on the hit NBC series "Frasier" in 1993. His
   interpretation of the upper-class twit have won him the lion's share of
   good reviews, as well as two best supporting-actor Emmys. Perhaps it was
   inevitable that he be cast as the brother of Kelsey Grammer's Simpsons
   character.


>> Those hydrological and hydrodynamical Cappadocians

Benjamin Ball:  Cappadocia is a region of central Turkey that was the site of
   an ancient kingdom that rose from the ashes of the Hittite empire. It was
   later a Roman province, and is mentioned in the bible several times. Cities
   in Cappadocia are popular tourist sites because the ancient residents
   carved them out of the tufa, or sandstone. There are also several elaborate
   underground cities in Cappadocia, founded by Christians who wished to
   escape the persecuctions of the Roman empire and later the Byzantine
   empire. Having been there myself, I never heard anything really special
   about the Cappadocian's committment to water. The region is fairly arid,
   with only a few streams to irrigate the dusty soil. I believe that most of
   the present-day farmland is irrigated by the Turkish government from far-
   away rivers and reservoirs.


>> Arthur Fielder

Tom Restivo:  Maestro Arthur Fielder of the Boston Pops died in July of 1979,
   after serving as conductor for 50 years. He did much to bring classical
   music appreciation to the common folk, including free concerts at the Hatch
   Shell on the Charles River Esplanade (rhymes with 'promanade', not
   'lemonade' <g>) and orchestral renditions of 'modern' music from Big BAnd
   to the Beatles.

   His most famous concert was on July 4th, 1976, for the Bicentennial, where
   a record 250,000 fans heard Fiedler and the Pops play the '1812 Overture',
   complete with howitzers, bells, and fireworks.

   For a tribute a week after his death, the Pops replayed the music from that
   1976 concert, led by interim conductor Harry Ellis Dickson. The orchestra
   played the final piece, the signature 'Stars & Stripes Forever', without
   Dickerson and somewhat somberly ("The Missing Conductor Formation?") in
   tribute to Fiedler.

   There is a metal, six-foot bust of Fielder near the Hatch Shell.


>> Those Immortal Threads

 - Will the kids ever age? (aka. What year is this?)

Matt Rose:  When Bob and Cecil audition for the Krusty show, it says "ten
   years ago". By all logic, does this mean that (considering the original
   Sideshow Bob episode [7G12] was 7 years ago) Sideshow Bob only was on the
   show for three years? By that logic this means Sideshow Mel has been
   Krusty's sidekick for more than twice as long as Bob was. Perhaps we are
   supposed to go by the "characters do not age" theory for this one and
   assume Bob was on the Krusty show for the full 10 years.


Since Sideshow Bob has been shown to be with Krusty during the 1984 olympics
   (9F08) and the Falkland Islands invasion (1F16), one might assume we're
   still in 1989...


>> Loose Ends

Mark_Aaron Richey:  For some reason, various singers and comics have decided
   to stage specials in prisons, I guess figuring that risking their lives
   would increase their popularity and ratings.


Stephan Bonneville:  Springfield has a surprisingly high number of prisons for
   it's size. The number is now up to 4, consisting of: Springfield State
   Prison (9F22), Springfield Minimum Security Prison, (2F02) Springfield
   Women's Prison, (9F20) Springfield Medium Security Prison


If you remember your Physics 101, a fall of 11 seconds is about 2000 feet; add
   the length of the cord and the height of the pipe, and you get a *very*
   high dam. :) Of course, this doesn't take air resistance into account.
   Kelly M. Pellerin notes that the terminal velocity of a human being is
   about 120 miles/hour (176 ft/s), and computes the fall to about 200 feet.

% Some time later, the dam construction is well underway.  Cecil enters

Lisa: Um, do you know what you're doing?
 Bob: Lisa, you don't spend ten years as a homicidal maniac without 
      learning a few things about dynamite.
-- Or icepicks, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Cecil is about to push down the plunger, when suddenly Bart jumps 
% onto him from behind.

 Bart: [holding Cecil's eyes closed from behind] Guess who?
Cecil: Maris?
-- Metahumor, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bart hits Cecil with his hard hat, while Cecil attempts to retaliate 
% with the briefcase.  This proves to be a mistake, as the case flies 
% open, and the money and gun fly away.  Cecil quickly subdues the ten-
% year-old, and holds him over the canyon.

Cecil: At last I'm going to do what Bob never could.  Kill Bart 
       Simpson!
 Bart: Throwing me off a dam?  Isn't that a little crude for a genius 
       like you.
Cecil: Ooh, I suppose it is.  Eh, if anyone asks, I'll lie.  [throws 
       him off]
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bart plunges, screaming.  Lisa gasps and screams as well, while Bob 
% takes action.  Holding onto the dynamite, he jumps off the dam, 
% swinging over to catch the boy, which he does, miraculously.  
% Unfortunately, Cecil is able to get over to the plunger, where he 
% prepares to dispatch the two.

And now, to kill you.  There may be a slight ringing in your ears.
Fortunately, you'll be nowhere near them.
-- Cecil, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Bob notes that they could save the town by cutting the wires, causing 
% them to fall to their deaths.  "Do we have to?"  "Yes."  Bob cuts the 
% wires a split second before Cecil plunges.  They fall endlessly, 
% until Bob manages to catch onto a pipe...between his legs.  Ouch.
%
% Bob slides around, allowing Bart to climb to safety.  Bart then pulls 
% Bob up.

 Bob: You...you saved my life.
Bart: Yeah.  I guess that means you can't ever try to kill me again!
 Bob: [sinister music] Oh, I don't know about that.  [music stops] 
      Joking, joking!
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Springfield's finest take the younger Terwilliger into custody.

You've brought shame to this family, Cecil.  Oh, I don't relish having
to write the Christmas letter this year.
-- Sideshow Bob, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Cecil notes that destroying Springfield is actually surprisingly 
% difficult.
%
% Chief Wiggum pulls up, and Lou presents the perpetrator.

   Lou: Here's your man, chief.
Wiggum: Cecil?  I think not.  This looks like the work of crazy old 
	Sideshow Bob.
  Lisa: No, Chief, Bob's innocent, it's the truth!
Wiggum: Truth, hah?  That sounds like the testimony of crazy old Lisa 
	Simpson.
   Lou: Cecil just voluntarily confessed, Chief.
Wiggum: That's some good work, Lou.  You'll make sergeant for this.
   Lou: Uh, I already am sergeant, Chief.
-- The flabby arm of the law, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Wiggum continues to insist that Bob is responsible, so both brothers 
% are hauled off in a squad car.
%
% Bart notes that it's funny how the citizens of Springfield never knew 
% how close they came to complete destruction.  Or so he thinks: at 
% that moment, the weakened dam breaks up, sending a wall of water 
% towards the city.  Homer, setting out to look for his children runs 
% back inside to escape from it.  As the water subsides, he sees a bed 
% with an eight-year-old boy on his lawn.

I think I wet my bed.
-- Ralph, "The Brother From Another Series"

% Back to the dam.

  Bob: You can't do this!  I saved the children's lives, I'm a hero!
Cecil: [craftily] Tell them they'll live to regret this.
  Bob: You'll live to regret this!  [realizing] Oh, thanks a lot, now I 
       look crazy.  [Cecil smiles smugly]
-- "The Brother From Another Series"

% Wiggum wonders what schemes such a pair of criminal geniuses, locked 
% away together, might concoct.
%
% Cut to a cell at Springfield Prison.  The cell doors slam shut over 
% the brothers Terwilliger.  Then, both jump towards the bed, fighting 
% each other.

  Bob: I, I'm older, I get the top bunk.
Cecil: Oh, poppycock, I called it at the arraignment.  [Bob is 
       victorious.]  [Cecil brushes himself off] So, when do they bring 
       us the menus?
-- Sharp learning curve ahead, "The Brother From Another Series"
