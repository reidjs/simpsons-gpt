   ... everyone besides Lisa seems to get in the bus without paying?

       of Duff billboards?

       counting 3G02, and the syndicated version of 4F19 [Which was recycled
       from 3F23])?

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold: Too much plot for a 22-minute episode, but still quite
   adequate.  As usual, the second most-important character in a Lisa episode
   is Homer, and his characterization here is as sympathetic as it was in
   "King of the Hill."  The continuing Lisa/Homer relationship is, for me,
   the most interesting aspect of the show, and this episode has interesting
   things to say about it.  Not a classic, but a good solid episode.
   (Grade: B+)

Paul Canniff: Nice to see the plotline get a little bit more down-to-earth
   after last week's craziness. The toucan sam/frankenstein hybrid was an
   interesting sub-plot but they could have done so much more with it. Bart
   simply walks home and shows Marge. "Off to the hospital". I was
   expecting Bart to go freak people out with it or *something*, instead we
   get an open-ended gag that went nowhere. Though I thought Dr. Hibbert's
   line: "No, it had to be *terror* sweat." was a nice touch. The second
   act is where the main story picked up or what little there was of a main
   story. I think the content of the episode is pieced together simply by
   atmosphere elements, meaning, the things that Lisa encountered are what
   made it interesting. There was barely any confrontational event that
   occured while Lisa was lost other than being scared by the bizarre
   townsfolk. The third act I thought was going to go nowhere, but when it
   seemed like the episode was going to end at an abrupt time (which is
   what I always expect in Season 9), they wrapped it up with the "msytical
   music box" which gave some merit to an otherwise meaningless trip to the
   museum. Overall, another slow-paced Season 8 style episode with "silent
   gags", (silent gags, meaning, gags that only make me laugh in my head)
   except that's taking it a little too far because Season 8 episodes
   actually had a purpose. Season 9 episodes usually don't have a purpose,
   they are just a cluster of spontaneous events, and "Lost Our Lisa" was a
   perfect example of that. You could tell that it was written with a
   premise in mind, but the premise was washed out with colorless sight
   gags that didn't have any impact humorwise.  (Grade: C+)

Nathan Mulac DeHoff: This week's episode was another somewhat confusing one.
   The plot wandered quite a bit, and did not really go anywhere.  Still,
   there were a lot of good laughs, and the characters were in good form
   throughout most of the episode.  There were some humorous signs,
   locations, and situations.  Overall, I thought that it did a good job of
   presenting ridiculous situations while not straying quite so far from
   reality as many episodes this season.  An exception was Homer's head
   getting closed in the bridge, which was over the top in terms of
   preposterousness, and not even all that funny.  I did like Homer's "I'll
   just walk it off" response, though.  While I found Homer and Lisa's
   bonding at the end to be interesting, I thought that the dialogue (and
   the action, to a lesser extent) seemed forced.  (Grade: B-)

Jordan Eisenberg: I'm really split in half here.  There were many gags I
   enjoyed and appreciate, but the rest is quite uninteresting and
   forgettable.  I liked the tidy closure for "The Cartridge Family" with
   Homer's gun in his drawer.  I liked the culture misunderstanding between
   Lisa and the Russians.  I liked Homer realizing he was talking to Marge in
   the car and the nice music-box ending.  That's about it.  The rest seemed
   like something even Matt Groening has spoken against.  Homer hanging from
   an intentionally fatal drawbridge by his tire-treaded skull?  A obese man
   and an eight-year-old girl climbing three stories on a fragile museam
   exhibit going unnoticed?  Homer's speech in the car was a nice attempt at
   a plot twist, but it just didn't click right for me. Just WHAT was he
   trying to prove?  I watched it three times and I haven't grown fonder of
   it.  Maybe when season ten rolls around I might see it in better light
   but for now, it stays a... (Grade: B-)

Alex Foley: Brian Scully does a wonderful job in his first episode. Most of
   the gags work and all the characters are in character. Only Homer in the
   Cherry Picker and the too short sub-plot bring this down from a 10/10.
   Still, the best episode since "Lisa's Sax".  (Grade: A-)

Andrew Gill: This episode had something for everyone.  A "Bart the
   Troublemaker" ep, a "Bart the Repentant Brother" ep, a "Homer the Idiot"
   ep, a "Homer the not-quite too Dumb" ep, "Lisa the Intelligent Girl," "Lisa
   the Rebel," etc. The characterization was stellar.  They took risks with
   *all* of the characters, and they *all* succeeded.  They conveyed a great
   point about risks, too.  Homer was a lovable idiot, again.  Lisa wasn't
   preachy, yet all the characters were in their correct modes.  The plot was
   great, the humor was reality based (for the most part), and the characters
   were on.  Good job!  This is the first A that I've given in a LONG time--
   only Homer's concussion keeps it from an A+.  (Grade: A)

Tony Hill: What mixed feelings.  OFF put together a very hilarious episode,
   but they killed it on another level with two mistakes.  How can Lisa all
   of a sudden go from interpreting Jewish doctrine to being an ordinary
   passive 8 year old?  And was that stupid, anti-climactic cherry picker
   sequence really necessary?  Although LOL had me LOL, it's only good for
   a (Grade: C+)

John Isles IV: Like "Simpson Tide" was to "This Little Wiggy", this was a
   great follow-up to last week's "King of the Hill".  The story for Bart's
   sub-plot had quite a few laughs, but id wasn't perfect.  I liked how
   common human sweat got the Krazy Glue-type compound off.  The main story
   started off sluggish, but it was nice how Lisa started turning rebellious
   by wanting to use a bus-- Why Homer let her, I don't know.  I thought this
   story picked the pieces up at the end of the second act, and it didn't
   decrease since. An episode that left me satisfied, as did last week's.
   (Grade: A-)

Haynes Lee: The main Lisa plot was pointless but Bart's visit to Dr. Hibbert
   was hilarious.  (Grade: C-)

Jake Lennington: A not-so-neat episode that seemed to wander around too much.
   My favorite scenes include:  Lisa stuck in "Little Russia", the Scene with
   Bart at the doctor, and the teachers on the Roller Coaster.  Anyway, it was
   good to see Homer mellowed out and have him teamed up with Lisa.
   (Grade: A-)

Ondre Lombard: A pleasant surprise which makes Season Nine better than Season
   Eight, in that it's the first episode I've given an A to since Season
   Seven's finale, "Summer of 4'2."  A realistically troubling situation for
   both Lisa and Homer when Lisa's natural immaturity gets her lost in
   Springfield.  The subplot with Bart works well with the main plot, and
   doesn't go on for too long.  Most of the humor is woven well into the story,
   too, which is rare. Not to mention everyone is in character for once, and
   the episode deals primarily with the family--and not the entire town.  Act
   Three's change of pace feels more like a story progression and less a jump
   from one thing to a completely unrelated other.  All and all, an
   outstanding effort, especially for the waning ninth season.  (Grade: A)

Andrew Milner: Not a GREAT episode, but it had its moments.  (Grade: B)

Tom Rinschler: Another average episode, although I certainly can identify with
   Lisa predicament with getting on the wrong bus.  The plot kind of
   meandered, but in that wandering packed in some reasonably good moments
   (Especially the scene with Homer on the street: "Shouldn't you be at work?"
   "Someone stop that awful, awful man!").  I know that Lisa's deviousness and
   the slow pace of the plot will lose it points in other peoples' reviews.
   However, a nice ending offsets some of its problems.  (Grade: B)

Benjamin Robinson: Lisa's trip to unexplored Springfield is neither as long
   nor as funny as I would have liked, but we get some new insight into Homer,
   and nice Lisa-Homer scenes, to boot.  We also get to see several sides of
   Lisa, from sly trickster, to frightened lost girl, to loving daughter.
   A heavily-hyped subplot featuring Bart and some novelty disguises
   helps this episode.  Nice work, overall.  (Grade: B)

Matt Rose: I liked this episode...it's not often that I get that warm feeling
   at the end of the show anymore but this one leaves a good taste in my
   mouth. A half-hour after I watched it I can remember a lot of what happened
   which is another thing that doesn't occur much these days but always did in
   the past.  A few of the jokes fall flat but most worked for me. I will
   admit I did like the drawbridge being closed on Homer's head and the
   subseqeunt "I'll walk it off".  We got to see a side of Lisa we don't see
   often, which is the ability to be devious. But don't act like it doesn't
   happen occasionally....It's a bit of Lisa's character which actually goes
   all the way back to the Tracey Ullman days (watch any short... she's as
   devious as Bart but smarter).  I thoroughly enjoyed the bonding between
   Lisa and Homer; the ending immediately brought to mind episodes such as
   "Lisa's Wedding" and "Bart on the Road" where the two are close.
   What I have always expected (and until recently, got) from the Simpsons is
   something very funny and emotionally heartwarming in the same show. The
   past two seasons it seems like the show is either one or the other (and
   occasionally neither); I can't seem to have both. Still, an episode worth
   watching for this harsh critic :)  It could have been funnier though, and
   that prevents it from getting an 'A'.  (Grade: B+)

Aaron Varhola: A pleasant surprise.  Lisa was believable as a mature
   8-year-old, but an 8-year old nonetheless.  The third act had classic
   Homer-Lisa bonding, a la [8F12]  and [3F16].  Homer and Lisa love each
   other on their own terms, and the relationship should strengthen over time,
   if [2F15] is any indication.  Brian Scully could have done more with
   Lisa's getting lost in the various neighborhoods of Springfield, though,
   a la "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"; Lisa could have been at first scared, then
   delighted at seeing a world unknown to her.  (Grade: A-)

Yours truly: A fairly good episode. Many laughs and a great, simplistic
   story. Lisa was quite annoying when she outsmarted Homer on the phone, but
   we are rewarded by seeing her misfortunes later. (Grade: B+)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Bart Simpson, Dalai Lama

Benjamin Robinson: The Dalai Lama (which translates to something like, "ocean
   of wisdom") is the spiritual leader of the Tibetian people.  According to
   tradition, when the Dalai Lama dies, he is reborn as a child somewhere in
   Tibet so that he may carry on his work.  So, after the current office
   holder passes away, teams of monks scour the countryside looking for clues
   to see who might be destined to be the next Dalai Lama.  Finally, the
   successor is found and coronated, if that's the word, and the cycle begins
   anew.  Somehow, I doubt even a gullible monk would take Bart's word that
   he is the new Dalai Lama.


>> X-ray Specs

Haynes Lee: These glasses had feathers in the little eye-holes which create
   diffraction that makes it look like you can see through someone's clothes.


>> The Treasures of King Tut

Tom Rinschler: The Egyptian exhibit is loosely based on this famous touring
   exhibit of a couple of decades ago.

   Similarities:
   - Both discoverd by Englishmen (though Howard Carter didn't accidently fall
     into Tutankhamen's tomb like Sir Dudley Winthrop did with the Temple of
     Isis)
   - This is the first time the Treasures of Isis has been seen outside of
     England, while tthe Tut exhibit was the first time out of Egypt
     (incidently, the English were notorious for hoarding antiquities, such as
     the frieze of the Parthenon, hence the joke).
   - Long lines, overblown hype, and silly souveniers


>> Treasures of ancient England

Benjamin Robinson: Lisa mentions that this is the first time the "Treasures of
   Isis" exhibit has been out of England.  During England's imperial age, her 
   archaeologists combed the globe for interesting artifacts to display back
   home.  This allowed the Western world to get acquainted with other
   civilizations, but today stealing national treasures is considered kind of
   passe.  In acknowledgement of the new age, England has been shipping back
   some artifacts back to their original governments.  It's likely that this
   is Lisa's last chance to see the Isis exhibit without having to go to Egypt.


>> Big Newark

Benjamin Robinson: Newark, New Jersey, is a city near New York City.  It's
   known primarily for its huge airport, which serves passengers travelling to 
   New York City and northern New Jersey.  Also, the Prudential Insurance 
   company headquarters is located there.  It's safe to say that most of 
   the people who go to Newark are on their way to somewhere else.  The 
   city itself has hit a rough patch lately, with the urban blight and 
   rising crime rate often associated with metropolitan areas.


>> You are here. We are not.

Benjamin Robinson: In UFO lore, Area 51 is the top secret facility where the
   Air Force has stashed the bodies of aliens who crash-landed here in 1947.  
   As it turns out, there really is an Area 51:  It's where the military tests 
   new aircraft.  UFO skeptics have argued that many people mistake the 
   prototype fighters flying around for bona fide aliens.  Incidentally, 
   like Lisa's Area 51-A, Area 51 was so secret that the government would 
   neither confirm nor deny its existence.  With the slackening of 
   tensions in the Cold War, they've relaxed a bit and may even have 
   admitted that this large heavily guarded airplane proving ground isn't 
   just a figment of everyone's imagination.

Jeremy Reaban: Area 51 is where the government is supposedly testing UFOs, or
   vehicles based on UFO technology. 


>> Russian Translations

Courtesy of Lee Johnson: Since folks seem to be asking about the Russian in
   this episode, I gave the VCR a whirl and thought I'd give a rundown.

   FIRST STREET SCENE
   - Highest sign: Apteka (drugstore/pharmacy/chemist's)
   - Vertical sign: Myaso (meat)
   - Green awning: Knigi (books)
   - White sign: (hard to make out for sure, but I think I can see at least
     these two words, one above the other) Zapas (supply); Pochta (post
     office)

   SECOND SCENE
   - Sign behind the chess players: Sosiski (sausages)
   - Yes, the translations of the chess player's directions are accurate
     (although not the voice of a native speaker, btw)
   - Khlou khalash (or however you might spell it): not a Russian dish (if
     anything, sounds more Middle Eastern or even Hungarian to me). As I
     personally understood this when it was first mentioned in "The City of
     New York Vs. Homer Simpson," this is just meant to be a generic,
     foreign-sounding dish-- the sort of exotic, non-standard fare that might
     turn the nose of a queasy tourist unused to the variety of foods that
     are taken for granted in New York. Of course, I could be proven wrong on
     this.

   THIRD SCENE
   - Purple awning over fruit stand: Frukty (fruit)
   - Red phone booth with cupola: Telefon (telephone)
   
   SO... I'm sorry to say, the Russian in this episode is rather prosaic. No
   hidden jokes to report there.


>> Where is Springfield?

Tony Hill: The area code on the museum brochure seemed to be 304, which would
   mean Springfield is in West Virginia.

Benjamin Robinson: Area 51-A is logically likely to be adjacent to Area 51.
   In turn, Area 51 is located somewhere in the desert immediately to the east
   of the Rocky Mountains.

>> Comments

- N.R.M.D.: "I have been somewhat disappointed by the two episodes before
  Lost Our Lisa, and was pleasantly greeted tonight with what I felt was a
  very funny show.  But did anyone else think that the episode was very
  disturbing?  A few examples of this were the whole dog doo conversation,
  Marge pulling Bart by the novelties, Homer's head being trapped in the
  draw bridge, and, of course, Dr. Hibbert.  I'm not complaining, because
  it was amusingly disturbing, like Mr. Bunny and the Cat Lady in previous
  shows, but this one was just nuts."

- Ondre Lombard, "When this episode first telecast in Los Angeles, I missed
  the first twenty minutes.  Why?  Because Sunday afternoon, I was catching
  buses in strange areas, and basically lost.  A chilling bit of irony that I
  would rather have not had to deal with.  Perhaps that harrowing experience
  might bias me towards Lost Our Lisa, I don't know.  I'm just glad that Lost
  Our Lisa wasn't in any way stupid, or trivializing the scariness of being
  lost."

- Aaron Varhola, "Irony:  the Portland Art Museum has "Splendors of Ancient
  Egypt" as their feature exhibit; last May, their exhbit was "Imperial Tombs
  of China", including unique terra-cotta soldier figures like the Terra
  Cotta Warriors of Xian mentioned by Lisa in [4F21]."

- Alex Foley, "Season nine looks to be ending on a high-note."

- Gene Simkin, "It's interesting to me, having read the three reviews above
  that no one even mentions the fairly indepth exploration of the Russian
  neighborhood!  I suppose that that is because none of the three authors are
  Russian.  I on the other hand am, and have to note that I thought that that
  was BY FAR the funniest thing in the episode. It was brilliant! The signs
  were all in russian, (spelled right!) and the actors actually spoke
  Russian. The writers must have investigated a great deal in order to get
  the stereotypes that perfectly. I wouldn't be surprised if they actually
  have a Russian person on the staff.  The Simpsons often make references to
  things that many people won't get, but this was bolder than anything
  they've done in  a  while.


>> Miscellaneous

- MPAA rating: TV-PG. {je}

- Leave it to FOX to focus on the crappy subplot in the previews. {ag}

- Haynes Lee's alterna-title for the episode is... [drum roll] "Driving Miss
  Lisa".

- Jordan Eisenberg's is "Oh Daughter, Where Art Thou?".

==============================================================================
% Ah, another beautiful Springfield morn. Bart and Milhouse walk through a
% busy street together.

Milhouse: Hey Bart, what's your favorite thing about teacher's conference day?
    Bart: Hmmm, I'm guess that we don't have to go to school.
Milhouse: Woah, mine too!
-- Very haunting, "Lost Our Lisa"

% They pass Barney, who is dressed very sharply.

Morning, boys. Can't stop to chat; time is money!
-- Barney on the way to Moes, "Lost Our Lisa"

% While the teacher's enjoy a rollercoaster ride, Bart and Milhouse visit the
% joke shop. The doorbell squirts water in Milhouse's face, and the door
% handle punches Bart in the gut.

Milhouse: Check it out, Bart, x-ray specs! [looks at the clerk, who appears
          exactly as before through the spectacles] Hey, these don't work!
   Clerk: Uhh, lead shirt.
Milhouse: I'll take three pairs! Here's my prescription!
-- At the joke shop, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Bart messes around with a fire extinguisher that shoots snakes.

Maybe you can help me. I don't think my face is hilarious as it could be.
-- Bart at the joke shop, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Soon enough, Bart looks a lot more hilarious than before. He has a colorful
% beak, screws in his neck, huge teeth and a faucet on his head. The
% accessories fall off instantly.

Milhouse: If you put dog doo on the suction cups they'll stick better.
    Bart: Milhouse, I'm not gonna take dog doo that's been on the dirty ground
          and put it on my face.
-- Healthy thinking, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Bart has a better idea. They go to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,
% Sector 7G, where Homer is sleeping on the job.

 Bart: Hey dad, wake up!
Homer: [wakes up] Huh, what? I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm a productive member of
       the team! You can't fire me, I quit! Pleeaase, I have a family!
 Bart: Relax, dad, it's just me.
-- Homer sleeping on the job, "Lost Our Lisa"

 Bart: I was wondering if you had any industrial strength adhesive I could use
       on my face.
Homer: Well, let's see what we've got in the old drawer! [shuffles things
       around in the drawer] Aha, there's some glue! [Homer pulls the glue,
       which is stuck to the bottom, out with great, great struggle, taking
       a big chunk of the drawer with it.] Hope this stuff holds.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Back at home, Lisa is excited about going to the Egyption artifacts exhibit.

Just let me put some film in the camera and we'll hop in the car! You can get
a picture of your mommy with a mummy!
-- Marge about to go to the Egyption artifacts exhibit with Lisa.

% Just as Marge and Lisa are about to leave, Bart arrives home. Marge tells
% him to take the accessories off his face, but they won't come off. Marge
% finds the super-glue.

Mom, I didn't eat any of it. I'm not stupid.
-- Bart, upon super-glueing some accessories to his face, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Marge cancels her day out with Lisa so she can rush Bart to the hospital.
% Lisa asks if she can take the bus to the exhibit.

A bus? Alone? Absolutely not! It's just too dangerous for an eight year old.
In a few years when you're old enough to drive, then you can take a bus!
-- Marge responding to Lisa's request to take a bus, "Lost Our Lisa"

% The car leaves, and Lisa is sad -- until she has an idea. She phones Homer
% at work.

Homer: Yellow?
 Lisa: Dad?
Homer: Who is this?
 Lisa: It's Lisa! I just called to tell you how much I love you and can I
       take the bus to the museum?
Homer: Museum? I don't like the sound of that... what did your mother say?
 Lisa: Umm, I wasn't one hundred percent clear on that. She said something,
       but she was kind of in a rush to get Bart to the emergency room.
Homer: Hmmm, so you wanna take the bus, huh? I don't know, that's a pretty
       big decision.
 Lisa: Well, if it would put your mind at ease I could take a limousine. But
       that would cost $200.
Homer: $200?! Ohh, isn't there any other way?
 Lisa: Hmmm, I guess I could take the bus if you think that's a better idea.
Homer: Frankly, I do. I know you had your heart set on the limo but sometimes
       daddy's have to say no, honey! I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the
       bus.
 Lisa: [fakely sad] Alright.
Homer: Atta girl, I love you s--
       [Lisa hangs up]
 Lisa: Yes!
-- Lisa on the phone to Homer, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa goes to the bus stop.

Lisa: Ahh, the old number 22. Clean, reliable public transportation. The
      chariot of the people. The ride of choice for the poor and very poor
      alike. Sure, some folks prefer--
 Moe: Uh, you gettin' on this next bus, kid?
Lisa: Yes!
 Moe: [whistles] Taxi! [gets into taxi] VD clinic.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa gets onto the bus and looks for a seat.

 Lisa: May I sit there?
Agnes: Of course not, honey! That seats for my coin purse. [She puts her
       coin purse down. After Lisa leaves she picks it back up.]
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% She tries somewhere else.

          Lisa: May I have that seat?
Comic Book Guy: Yes! If you can answer me these questions three. Question
                the first!
          Lisa: Never mind. [walks away]
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa remains on the bus for a while, as the bus stops at various stops.
% After a while, Lisa is the only passenger on the bus and she is far from
% Springfield. The bus driver tells her she's on the wrong bus if she wants
% to go to the museum, and that she has to get out the bus -- it's the end of
% the line.

% In the hospital Bart and Marge wait to be seen. Another boy with a faucet
% stuck to his walks by -- only he was caught in a plumbing explostion.

That's the kind of faucet I want for your bathroom!
-- Marge sees a boy with a faucet stuck in his head, "Lost Our Lisa"

% After a while Lisa comes to what appears to be Area 51! She speaks to a
% security guard there.

          Lisa: Huh, how could I confuse bus 22 with 22-a. Area 51! Hah!
                I found Area 51!
                [steps aside from sign revealing the letter "A"]
Security Guard: No, ma'am, this is Area 51-A.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% The security guard refuses to tell Lisa where she is.
% She continues to wander.

Stupid bus can't even go to the stupid place it's supposed to stupid go!
-- Stupid Lisa, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa sees a dead animal. Cletus shovels it onto the back of his truck,
% where there is a big pile of dead animals.

I saw him first! Curly Sue's gonna have an elegant wedding feast!
-- Cletus collecting dead animals, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa asks for a ride.

Brandine: [looking out of the truck window] Cletus, what are you beating your
          gums about?
  Cletus: Never you mind, Brandine! You just go back to birthing that baby!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa can have a ride, but she has to sit in the back with the dead animals,
% including a skunk which can "go off" even after it's dead. Lisa runs away.

% Back in Springfield, Dr. Hibbert inspects Bart's face.

Young man, there's nothing funny about novelties. [laughs] I mean, they're
humorous and all, but this is certainly no laughing matter. [laughs]
-- Dr. Hibbert, treating Bart's novelty ridden face, "Lost Our Lisa"

      Marge: Can you help him, doctor?
Dr. Hibbert: Oh my yes. Why, if I had seventy five dollars for every
             novelty I removed-- oh, by the way, I'll need a check for
             seventy five dollars.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Dr. Hibbert decides the only way to remove the novelties is by a painful
% injection into Bart's spine. The medical apparatus looks very intimidating
% (many sharp points pumping back and forth). As Dr. Hibbert gets closer, the
% novelties fall off!

      Marge: What happened? You didn't do anything!
Dr. Hibbert: Oh, didn't I? [laughs] Nothing dissolves glue better than human
             sweat. I knew Bart would panic and start perspiring at the sight
             of this button abricator!
       Bart: Couldn't you have just turned the heat up a little?
Dr. Hibbert: [sinister] Oh, heavens no! It had to be terror sweat!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% At the power plant, Homer enjoys lunch with Lenny and Carl. Carl is wearing
% a large hat that looks like a pyramid.

 Carl: So, uh, ain't you guys gonna ask me about my hat?
Lenny: Oh! Hey, Carl, what's with the hat?
 Carl: Oh, what, this thing?
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

I got it down at the museum. It's what the Ancient Egyptions call a
"souvineer".
-- Carl, "Lost Our Lisa"

% When Lenny and Carl find out Homer let Lisa take the bus alone, they are
% digusted with him.

Lenny: [spits out food] You sent your little girl downtown on a bus?
 Carl: Alone?
Homer: Maaaaybe... but you don't know Lisa, I mean, she's so smart they
       hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach her some things, but
       she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and
       caught on fire!
 Carl: That never, uh, happened, did it Homer?
Homer: Yes, but now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter. [runs away]
       Oh Lisa!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa walks around the Russian district of Springfield. She walks over to
% two chess players.

 Lisa: Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the museum?
  Man: [Shouting in Russian. Dialogue is translated at bottom of screen]
       My pleasure. It's six blocks that way. [Lisa runs away.]
  Man: [Shouting] Hey, she went the wrong way.
Man 2: Checkmate. [the other man throws the chess board to the ground.]
  Man: [Shouting] Good game. How about another?
-- "Lost Our Lisa"


 Everywhere she goes, strange people
% try to sell her things. She goes a phone booth and calls Homer, but his
% answer machine answers the call.

    Homer: You have reached the office of Homer Simpson. If you are calling
           about the waterbed, please leave a detailed message. If you need--
Mr. Burns: Get back to work!
    Homer: [screams, we hear the dial tone]
-- Homer's answer machine message, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Another strange local scares Lisa away.

% Homer runs through the museum looking for Lisa, but she is nowhere to be
% seen. He stands in the middle of the road begging for someone to have seen
% Lisa.

       [a car pulls up]
Homer: For God sakes, my little girl is--
       [the window rolls down, revealing Marge]
       Agh! Hello!
Marge: Homer, what's going on, shouldn't you be at work?
Homer: I am at work.. this is what I do! Get moving Marge, this isn't a
       parking lot!
Marge: Sorry! [drives away]
-- Homer looking for Lisa, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Another car arrives. Mr. Burns rolls the window down.

    Homer: Agh!
Mr. Burns: Shouldn't you be at work right now?
    Homer: Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Burns, sir...
Mr. Burns: Well, then get back to wherever it is you work, whoever you are.

% Homer asks Chief Wiggum (who is dressed in drag) for help, but he's in the
% middle of a stakeout. Snake steals his purse.
% The streets are simply too busy for Homer to see Lisa.

Homer: This is no good, I gotta get up higher! [walks over to a balloon
       salesman] Give me all of your balloons. [the salesman hands him a
       dozen or so balloons] I hope this works... [walks to guy in a cherry
       picker] These are for you if you let me use your cherry picker!
  Guy: Well, I've already got some balloons, but.. they're not this nice.
       Deal!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Homer gets in and raises himself above the crowd. Once up there, he spots
% Lisa. He tells her he's coming down, but instead he sends the cherry
% picker speeding down a hill and towards a river. The vehicle ends up in
% the water. Lisa gets a the man behind the drawbridge controls to bring it
% down, and tells Homer to hold on. Instead, his head gets caught in between
% the two sides.
% Homer and Lisa walk away.

 Lisa: Are you sure you don't wanna go to a doctor? I mean, a drawbridge did
       close on your head...
Homer: No, I'll just walk it off.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% As they drive home, Lisa regrets what she did.

 Lisa: I'll never take another stupid risk like that again.
       [Homer stops the car]
Homer: Don't ever say that!
 Lisa: What?
Homer: If I hadn't of taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker I would
       have never found you!
 Lisa: I guess...
Homer: Stupid risks are what make life worth living!
-- Father of the year, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Homer explains that stupid risks are the reason for his many adventures.
% The car starts rolling backwards towards the river.

 Lisa: Dad, you're headed for the river again!
Homer: [laughs] Feel your heart pumping a mile a minute! That's what my
       heart's doing all the time! I bet your left arm's tingling too.
-- Actually... "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa says she wants to go to the exhibit, but it's closed. Homer decides
% it would be a stupid risk trying to get in, and that they should do it!

Feeling stupid? I know I am!
-- Homer, "Lost Our Lisa"

% They head for the museum.

% Marge, Bart and Maggie arrive home. Marge tells Bart to go and apologise
% to Lisa for making her miss the exhibit. Bart goes upstairs and stands
% outside Lisa's door.

 Bart: Hey Lis, I'm sorry I ruined your Egyption thing. We're still buds,
       right? [we see her room -- it's empty] OK, be that way, you big stupid
       jerk! Oh, you're not the jerk. I am. Forgive me? Oh, like you're miss
       perfect. Mom! Lisa's making me feel bad!
Marge: [from downstairs] Stop it, Lisa!
 Bart: That shut her up.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% At the museum, Homer and Lisa are climbing up a display outside. Security
% is on the lookout, but nobody has noticed them. They make their way to a
% window a floor or so up.

Could you open the window? The cops have daddy's prints on file.
-- Homer, as he and Lisa break into the museum, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa does so, and they go inside. They sneak down a corridoor into the
% exhibit. Lisa is taken aback by it's beauty.

 Lisa: Have you ever seen such exquisite ushabtis?
Homer: [not following] Eh, not this exquisite.
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Lisa spots something else.

 Lisa: Oh my gosh! It's the mysterious Orb of Isis! Archeologists have
       been studying it for decades and still have no clue what it means!
Homer: Well, daddy will figure it out!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

Oh, we can't touch it, dad! It's behind a velvet rope! [feeling the rope]
A velvet rope..
-- Lisa, "Lost Our Lisa"

% Homer goes for it, but knocks down the velvet rope, which in turn knock
% the Orb from it's display. It falls to the ground and opens, looking
% broken, but begins playing music -- it's a music box!

 Lisa: It's a music box! Dad, we uncovered the secret!
Homer: Oh, so now it's <we>, eh?
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

 Lisa: It's so beautiful! And just think, we're the first people to hear
       it's song in more than four thousand years! [they hug] Thanks for
       making me take such a stupid risk, dad!
Homer: Any time, honey. Just remember, never be afraid to live life on the
       edge. Now let's get home before your mother kills us!
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% Homer closes up the orb and puts it back.

 Lisa: It's kind of humbling, isn't it? The music we just heard might never
       be heard again.
Homer: Yeah, but it'll always live on because we'll never forget it. [begins
       whistling]
 Lisa: Dad, that's the Old Spice song!
Homer: It is? Well, that's a good song too! [continues the song, and Lisa
       joins him]
-- "Lost Our Lisa"

% They walk away. Homer yells "RUN!" as the alarm hits, and we hear fierce
% dogs on a rampage.
