===============================================================================
Homer's car antenna disappears.  {dh}

The spare tire on the inside of the trunk lid of Burns' limo isn't there
until just before he closes the lid.  {ddg}

Smithers' ID badge disappears in some scenes.  {dh}

Bart's chainsaw vanishes.  {dh}

Willy's body disappears after Homer axes him.  {dh}

When Homer first runs out of the house after the rest of the family, he
is running much faster than they are, and should have caught up with
them in seconds.  {mk}

Homer's axe disappears.  {dh}

The Tony Awards are in June, not in winter; also, the song being sung is
the one sung at the end.  {ddg}

Mr. Burns appears slightly off-model throughout "The Shinning".  {mk}

The toaster continues to spark after the plug has been pulled.  {crc}

From the angle Homer throws the toaster, he shouldn't be able to stick
his hand right back in it.  {mk}

The toaster only has two heating elements, both in the middle.  This
would make toast *very* slowly, and would only toast one side of each
slice of bread!  {mk}

When Homer finishes fixing the toaster, it has no cord or plug.  {ddg}

The toaster handle is sometimes up when it should be down.

Dinosaurs from different periods appear.  (see below) {pl}

Just stepping on the grass - just occupying space, for that matter -
should have an effect on the future.  (Just as Homer's giving the
dinosaurs a cold affected the future.)  {ddg}

When Maggie is forced to smile in Neducation, her pacifier disappears.
{ddg}

The basement door shouldn't adjoin the kitchen.  (See other episodes.)
{dh}

As the house is getting ready to be taken away, the House design & yard
layout is incorrect.  {dh}

Homer's Neddy clothing changes back to his normal clothing.  {dh}

Other than OFF's house, none of the other neighborhood houses are
affected.  {ddg}

Kodos and Kang are slightly off-model.  {mk}

Bart's desk moves from the back to the middle of the classroom.  {dh}

The door to Bart's classroom should open outwards.  (See other
episodes.)  {dh}

Wendell is in the classroom, detention room _and_ in the cafeteria.
{mk}

Lunch Lady Doris's cigarette vanishes in some scenes.  {dh}

It is very unlikely that Bart would actually be one of the remaining
five students.  {dh}

The first shot of Skinner has him with apron strings around his back,
but next shot shows him tie on the apron.

Bart is wearing his normal orange shirt in bed.  {mk}

No matter how Bart had been sleeping, there is no way he could be
sitting up in that slouched position with the covers laying the way that
they are.  Furthermore, Bart doesn't act all that scared.  {mk}

===============================================================================
> Reviews
===============================================================================
Joe Bedzek: Personally, I wasn't overly impressed.  I agree that "Time
    and Punishment" was really funny, and the other two had their
    moments.  My concern was mainly with the more gory nature of the
    show.  [...] It just seemed like there was a different tone to the
    special this year.

Carl Mueller It didn't disturb me, at least not in the way that it
    perhaps disturbed you.  What disturbed me is how the Simpson's
    writers can keep putting out crap like this.  When a show makes last
    year's Hallowe'en episode look GOOD, you've got something truly
    awful on your hands.

Matthew Kurth: "The Shinning" did not stand up on its own; "Time and
    Punishment" was mediocre; "Nightmare Cafeteria" was an undeveloped
    fit of pure tastelessness.  More sick than scary.  Easily the worst
    of the five. 6/10

Keith Hudson: I thought it was fantastic.  I laughed so hard when Homer
    got his hand stuck in the toaster TWICE!  And then when he was
    beating the crap out of everything back in time (i.e. stepping on
    the little lizard, punching the flying one.)...Great episode.

Don Del Grande: Grade: A - it competes with #2 for the best Halloween
    special; of course, one of the things that makes Halloween Specials
    so good is the fact that "the rules don't apply".

Tiare Williams: I'm sorry, but that Halloween V was like old times
    again.  I was ROTFL last night, and I haven't in a long time.  The
    inside-out thing was kinda gruesome, but I loved the rest!!

Sean Curran: IMHO the Simpsons Hallowe'en Episodes are by far the best
    and most original scripts and shows that the creators have ever come
    up with.  I love the parodies and I think that the openings of the
    Hallowe'en specials are the funniest that the show is able to come
    up with.

Joe Clark: I have to say this weekend's Hallowe'en show was not funny
    but disturbing.  Creepy, even.  I suppose that's the point, since
    it's a Hallowe'en show and all, but the Sloppy Jimbo et al. scenes
    were all too realistic, if that can be said about a cartoon.

Marc Singer: Halloween specials III and especially II were fantastic.  I
    and IV had their moments.  This one, with the exception of one
    sketch and one brief opening segment, wasn't all that great.  Since
    I'm a Shining fan, I'll give it a charitable .500, but the Simpsons
    should be better than half-funny.

Tony Hill: This year's Hallowe'en Special was a scream!  The self-parody
    was right on the money!  I thought "Time and Punishment" was
    uproariously funny, which is surprising given the fact that it
    didn't have much plot material.  James Earl Jones's cameo should
    have us wondering who will do Maggie's voice next.  I give it an A.

Yours truly: Another fine Hallowe'en showing.  I prefer it when they can
    ditch continuity and just write madly.  "Time and Punishment" is a
    classic, I think -- up there with the all-time greats.  "Shinning"
    weird but OK, "Nightmare Cafeteria" gruesome...overall, I give it
    A-.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> John Denver

Tony Hill writes that John Denver "was a singer/songwriter popular in
    the early seventies.  He became an obscurity in record time.  If he
    really did have five Christmas specials, it would be that much more
    confounding."

>> Homer's comment about "non-Brazilian" time travelers

Mark Johnson's best guess is that Homer was referring to Carlos
    Castaneda, "a Brazilian who wrote about his chemical-induced
    `adventures' about twenty years ago.  A rather trendy (for the
    college crowd) set of books from the late-60's, early 70's."

>> Dinosaur errors

Pat Len notes that Jurassic dinosaurs (Apatosaurids, Stegosaurids) are
    mixed in with Cretaceous dinosaurs (Tyrannosaurid, Triceratosaurids,
    Hadrosaurids).  Also, the flora seems to be both Triassic and
    Cretaceous without the coniferous Jurassic stuff around for the
    Apatosaurs to eat.  This is just like the movie "Jurassic Park"
    where similar mixing occurs.

>> The fish Homer squishes

Michael Zey says, "As anybody who's ever taken science in college know,
    that critter that Homer stepped on was a Choanata.  Choanata were
    the first creatures to venture from water to land.  For Homer to
    kill it, it means that he would have wiped out the future of all
    land dwelling creatures...or maybe not."

>> The original McDonald's

While the house was changing rapidly, it became a McDonald's restaurant.
    Tony Hill explains, "The oldest surviving McDonald's, until
    recently, was in Downey, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.
    (Downey is also the home of the space shuttle and Karen and Richard
    Carpenter.)  The building was well-captured for OFF.  The building
    had an arch at either end, which when viewed from the side at a
    proper angle formed the familiar golden arches.  The place also had
    a complex neon sign.  McDonald's Corp. closed the store a year or so
    ago, citing unprofitability."

% Marge walks from behind a red curtain onto center stage into a

Marge: Hello once again.  As usual, I must warn you all that this year's
       Hallowe'en show is very, very scary, and those of you with young
       children may want to send them off for bed --
        [someone hands her a paper; she reads it]
       Oh, my!  It seems the show is _so_ scary that Congress won't even
       let us show it.  Instead they've suggested the 1947 Glenn Ford
       classic movie, "200 Miles to Oregon".

% tombstones", another reads "RIP".  Moe's body falls from a tree in a
% noose -- and suddenly opens its eyes.  Rev. Lovejoy burns Patty and
% Selma, dressed as witches, at the stake; they use the flames growing
% around them to light some cigarettes.  Principal Skinner's head is in
% a guillotine, above the decapitated heads of Mrs. Krabappel,
% groundskeeper Willy, and Chief Wiggum.  Bart appears and jumps on the
% basket containing the heads, stuffing them further in.  Skinner gives
% the thumbs-up, only to have his own head chopped off.  The couch scene

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:35]
%
% Over the credits, the family sings:
% 
% One!  -- chorus line of people, dancing till they make us stop
% Too!  -- many dancing people, covered with blood, gore, and glop.
% Just one sniff of that fog and you're inside out:
% It's worse than that flesh-eating virus you're read about!
% Vital organs, they are what we're dressed in,
% The family dog is eyeing Bart's intestine.
% Happy Hallowe'en!
%
% SLH drags Bart off, devouring him.
