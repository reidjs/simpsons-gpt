         Burns: [angry] Fish sticks? What in blazes are you talking about?!
       % Homer: Well, sir, they cut the head off the fish, and chop up
       %        the rest into sticks.  And then put seasoned bread crumbs

       ! The first scene of the act.

       % Simpson back yard. Castle tree house, Satellite Dish.
       % Marge massages Dimoxinyl into Homer's hair. He wears a Hawaiian
       % shirt, shades, and a pony tail.
       %
       % Marge: Between your hair care products and a new wardrobe,
       %        we’re not saving anything for a rainy day.
       %
       % Homer lifts his sunglasses.
<0:18> %
       % Homer: [giddy] Rainy day?  There's never going to BE a rainy day,
       %        Marge! There’s not a cloud in the Simpson sky! [to Lisa] And
       %        what does my little girl want?
       %  Lisa: An absence of mood swings, and some stability in my life.
       % Homer: [confused] Er--ay...  How 'bout a pony?
       %  Lisa: Okay!

       ! Later, after the Dimoxinyl spills, Homer says "You've been
       ! squirreling it [money] away, right Marge? That's what you said..."
       ! The meaning is lost, because the first scene of act III was cut...

~~

            Burns: Now, go and make an example of this hooligan!
<0:03> % Smithers: With pleasure, sir.

~~
         Smithers: Dead man coming through.
<0:04> %    Burns: Well, well, well. Our dashing young <junior> executive...
                   You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson.
                   I should fire you on the spot! [softening] But, I’m not
                   going to...
            Homer: Why?
       %    Burns: Simpson, how old do you think I am?
<0:06> %    Homer: I 'unno.  Hundred'n two?
       %    Burns: [sadly shakes head] I'm only eighty-one...

       ! Burns' "You made a hollow ," overlaps on the view of the stage in
       ! syndication, which was originally "Well, well, well."

       ! This scene is quoted as reason to believe Burns is not over 100
       ! years old--but it was cut.  Since this was in season 2, there is
       ! good support for Burns being in his 80s. But alas... Those
       ! pesky syndicators got us again... *SIGH*
