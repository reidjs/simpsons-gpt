> Reviews
===============================================================================
Mark Eckenwiler {me}:  This was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never
made me want to retch even once.

Karl Wagenfuehr {kw}:  Yes!  Great episode!

Jamie Ide {ji}:  Another good one!

David Hyatt {dh2}:  Easily one of the best episodes this season.

Jym Dyer {jd}:  A Big Thumbs Up!!!

Alan J Rosenthal {ajr}:  I'll have to watch it at least once more before I
give a review.  [Okay, we're waiting. --rjc]

Andrew Tannenbaum {trb}:  This episode was great, not for the story line,
but because of the steady barrage of hilarious dialogue.

Ron Carter {rc}:  Not as good as `Colonel Homer' but still solid Simpson...
I give it 4 out of 5 Barts...

Yours Truly {rjc}:  Another strong showing.  I still say that choosing Kelsey
Grammer was truly inspired casting.

    [7g12] The episode is an obvious sequel

    Note that in [7G12] it was Bart's faith that saved the day, whereas
    here, it was Bart's suspicion that solved the case.

>>> Music
    Can anyone identify Sideshow Bob's conjugal visit music?
    I can hum the melody but the title eludes me.

>>> Krusty and Sideshow Bob's on-air reconciliation
    Ted Frank {thf} notes that the telethon was a reference to the Rat Pack,
    and the falling out between Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.
    Gerson Koenig {gmk} adds the two were reconciled on the telethon by
    the ``Chairman of the Board'' himself (Frank Sinatra).

>>> Sexual
    Those pointed out by David Hyatt {dh2} are tagged with a `-'.

    - The conjugal visit trailers.
    - Krusty's aborted 12-inch penis joke.
    - Selma moaning with pleasure (until we learn that it's because Sideshow
      Bob is rubbing her feet).
    - ``I'm not sure how to put this...''  ``White!''
    - Only smoking after meals and... McGyver.
    - The nasty camera angle from between Selma's legs.
    * ``Choked you like a chicken'' (masturbation reference)

>> Sideshow Bob's parting comments

Exactly who was being bashed by Sideshow Bob's comment about the Democrats
and the White House?  Possible interpretations:

    (0)  It's just a joke, man.
    (1)  A swipe at the Democrats for...
         (a) being soft on crime
         (b) being locked out of the White House for so long
    (2) A swipe at the Republicans for...
         (a) being paranoid about Democrats being soft on crime
         (b) believing the Willy Horton media blitz
         (c) all being in jail
    (3) Irony considering Bob's status as a conservative Republican

>> Sideshow Bob's motive

Sideshow Bob already knew that Selma had lots of money.  (``I told you, I
got money.'')  Note also the transparent way he bemoans his lack of money,
just to get Selma to tell him another time about her financial security.

I guess Sideshow Bob is living proof that our revolving door prison system
doesn't work after all.  Sideshow Bob went in on a felony and came out
prepared to murder.

>> The videotape controversy

How did the Simpsons get Selma's honeymoon videotape so quickly?  Well,
Shelbyville is so close by, Selma could've had it messengered back.
Perhaps to make Patty jealous.

There's also no reason to insist that things happened as quickly as they
seemed.  The drive to the hotel was at night, yet the videotape was made
during the day.  And McGyver airs in the evening.  That leaves plenty of
time (perhaps even days) for things to develop.

>> Miscellaneous

Bob <missed> being kicked in the rear while in that over-crowded prison?! {kw}

% As for appetizers, Homer suggests...

Homer: You can't go wrong with cocktail weenies!  They taste as good as

       ain't ketchup!
Sideshow Bob: Well, Selma, he makes a good case.
-- Catering the wedding, ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

% Selma says they can get whatever they want.  ``All tastes like styrofoam

This wedding is spinning out of control.  Can we really afford it?
I've already run through eight of the ten dollars they gave me when
I left prison.

McGyver: Don't thank me.  Thank the moon's gravitational pull.
-- Watching television, ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

Selma: That McGyver's a genius.
Sideshow Bob: First of all, he's not a genius.  He's an actor.

Selma: [refusing to believe]  You're lying!  You're lying!
Sideshow Bob: No, Selma.  <This> is lying.

% Except after meals and after McGyver.  Bart remains suspicious.
%
% Bart asks Chief Wiggum if he trusts Sideshow Bob.  Chief Wiggum reassures

% the camera and smiles.
%
% Apparently, Sideshow Bob's complaining paid off.  He lights the fire,

%
% Back home, Bart wonders why Sideshow Bob would get so upset over a fireplace.
% Marge explains that he wants the honeymoon to be romantic.  ``Romantic?
% With Aunt Selma?''
%
% While Selma moans with delight, Sideshow Bob rushes frantically into the

% pack of cigarettes next to Selma, then evilly tiptoes across
% the room.  A knob goes *squeak*, then he tiptoes back.  ``Well,
% time for my walk!''  He quietly adds, ``Don't forget to die...''
%
% Patty stops by the Simpsons house, feeling somewhat lonely.  She asks
% to watch television with them and turns on McGyver.  The word ``McGyver''
% echos through Bart's head, then Bart stands and announces, ``Aunt Selma
% has one hour to live!''  Homer responds, ``Hey!  Down in front!''
%
% Sideshow Bob enjoys a drink by the hotel pool and says, ``Good-bye.''
% There is a tremendous explosion.  Sideshow Bob calmly picks up the
% phone and frantically reports a terrible accident in his room.
%
% Sideshow Bob returns to the exploded room (singing, ``Then I went and
% spoiled it all by doing something stupid like explode you'') as he
% approaches Selma's TV chair.  He spins it around, to find Bart sitting
% in it.  ``Sideshow Bob, I'm afraid the only victims here are the good
% people of Best Western Hotels.''  Sideshow Bob is understandably shocked
% to find Bart, as well as Selma, very much alive.

You tried to kill me.  I want a separation.
-- Selma to her husband of nary a few days Sideshow Bob,
   ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

% Sideshow Bob finds himself surrounded by police.

My best-laid plans have gang agley!
-- Sideshow Bob, poetic to the end, ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

Bart:   Chief Wiggum, think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser?
Wiggum: Well, no, frankly.  But that never stopped us before.
-- Sideshow Bob, foiled again, ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

Sideshow Bob: Bart, I must know.  How did you untangle my web?
Chief Wiggum: Yeah, Bart, pull us in!
Bart:         Well, I'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do
              his job...
Chief Wiggum: No no, please.  It's the only way I'll learn.
-- ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

% Bart explains.  He realized that the reason Sideshow Bob got so frantic
% over a measly fireplace was for the natural gas.  Surely anyone would have
% smelled a gas leak---except Selma.  While she watched McGyver, the room
% filled with gas, and the spark from her post-McGyver cigarette would set
% it off.

Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.
-- Bart the Hero, ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

% After trying four times to explain it to Homer, Bart explained it to
% Marge, who understood immediately, and the family mobilized.

To the Simpson-Mobile!
-- Homer, ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

% With a burst of flame, the Simpson-Mobile speeds off for Shelbyville.
% In her room, Selma prepares to light her cigarette, but Bart storms in
% and stops her just in time.
%
% But why, then, did the room explode?  Chief Wiggum and his men celebrated
% their success by smoking cigars in the hallway.  Chief Wiggum's carelessly
% discarded match ignited the gas.  Sideshow Bob is taken away.

I'll be back.  You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever.
And when they get in, I'm back on the street!  With all of my criminal buddies!
Ba-ha-ha-ha-ha!!
-- Sideshow Bob, ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

There was one little boy who never lost his mistrust.
-- Marge, on Bart's unraveling of Sideshow Bob's murderous plan,
   ``The Return of Sideshow Bob''

% Bart tells an incredibly feeble joke, and everyone chuckles endlessly.
