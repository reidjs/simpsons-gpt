> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [TVgen.com] Lisa is envious of a worldly new student from Capital City, who
   suggests the school hold a dance; Homer drags Bart into his grease-
   recycling business.  {je}

==============================================================================
> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Blackboard:     None due to shortened intro

Couch:          The family runs to the couch.  Just as they are about to sit
                down, Nelson yanks it back and has a good laugh at their
                expense.  [Recycled from 5F08]

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... Milhouse makes "grease angels" on the floor of the gym?
   ... the girlie calendar at the grease recycling depot, which pictured a
       bikini-clad woman leaning over a barrel of grease?
   ... both the girlie calendar and a school calendar were turned to March?
   ... Sherri and Terri are willing to hang out with second-graders like

   ... second-graders are interested in a school dance?  And dates?
   ... in Dingo Junction, Sherri and Terri still manage to wear identical new
       outfits?

Jordan Eisenberg:
   ... at 26 episodes, this has been the longest season yet?  [Assuming you
       count this show as a ninth season episode -- Ed.]
   ... the boy on the cardboard setup that Bart ambushed with staples was
       Jimmy: Troy McClure's sidekick in "Lisa the Vegetarian"?
   ... Apu is actually taking strides to maintain cleanliness in his store for
       once?
   ... SLH looked an awful lot like his pregnant girlfriend once did?

       better since 8F22?
   ... Lisa wore the bow and smile at the dance, just as Marge told her to?

Andrew Gill:
   ... Homer doesn't think that he's financially independent?
   ... the van Houtens seem to have interesting eyebrows?

   ... Uter wore a green sweater to the dance?

Andrew Levine:
   ... this is the first episode to air during the summer in 6 years?
   ... Bart was sad at having to miss school?
   ... Homer says that the pipe is bringing up the rear as it is sucking onto
       his rear?
   ... when Homer says he is excited about the plan, the pipe wags like a
       dog's tail?

+  Milhouse's hair was ripped out at the beginning, but returned later in the
   show.  {ms}

*  Why would Apu decline food stamps?  It's a cash cow for stores since they
   get a fee payment.  {th}

*  What sort of bizarre school schedule does Springfield have?  The first day
   of class took place in March.  [Andrew Krupowki guesses, "Perhaps the guy
   at the grease shop left the calendar in March because he liked the
   picture?"]  {bjr}

c  There's a captioning error when a blinded Ralph wanders out of the
   classroom.  While we hear Nelson offscreen tripping Ralph, the captioning
   indicated that Ralph wandered out into traffic, causing an accident.  {mar}

*  Lisa Kudrow pretty much sounds like a woman rather than a 8-year old girl.
   {hl}

+  What happened to the Puma statue in 8F15?  {hl}

=  Homer turns in 4 cans of grease, but the man weighs only 3 of them.  {mar}

+  Lisa seemed pretty eager to have her ears pierced after Bart got his
   earring.  (Or maybe she wanted it done professionally.)  {bjr}

=  When Homer drives by SES in the car, you don't see Bart in it in the first
   shot.  {mar}

*  Wouldn't somebody notice that Bart had been absent from school since the
   day it started?  {bjr}

*  Surely Marge would care about her son's education, rather than some stupid
   grease business.  {jg}

=  At Krusty Burger, the "red-haired" kid's hair was brown at first, then
   turned reddish-brown.  {ddg}

*  It's established that Bart is skipping school when he and Homer go to
   Krusty Burger.  So how come just about the entire staff of the place are
   teenagers who should be in school themselves?  {mar}

*  Plus, there was another kid eating at one of the booths.  {je}

-  Lisa's "Happy Little Elves" lunchbox just says "Little Elves".  {ddg}

+  Sherri and Terri already got their ears pierced in [3G04] "Simpson Tide".
   {ad}

+  Lisa seems to have meat on her plate at dinner?  {mar}

+  Ralph isn't wearing his eye patches in the playground.  {je}

=  In the same scene, we see Lewis sitting at the table in some shots, and
   standing in the background in others.  {je}

-  In a shot of Lisa with her Bleedin' Gums Murphy photo behind her, BGM
   appeared to be bald.  {jg}

*  If Lisa had to take the tickets, why was she worried about having a date,
   since she wouldn't have been able to dance with him while taking tickets?
   {ddg}

*  There is no way a ventilation duct could have fit both Homer and Willy on
   top of each other like that.  [Solon Boomer-Jenks writes, "Don't be so
   sure.  Some schools have very large ventilation ducts.  The last two high
   schools I went to had ducts large enough to crawl in, probably not enough
   to fight in though."]  {je}

*  The build-up of grease in the hose couldn't have happened as shown.  [See
   "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]  {jw}

c  During the dance, after Skinner had to leave the school due to some
   emergency involving his mother, the song that was playing when Lisa entered
   the gym was not "More", as the CC said. It was "I Can Love You Like That"
   by All-4-One.  {ja}

-  In the scene where the kids look up and see the grease dripping out of the
   fan ("It's snowing"), it looks as if the ductwork hangs below the ceiling.
   In the wide shot of the gym after the grease spills, however, the vents
   come out of the wall and no ductwork can be seen below the ceiling.  {brk}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  A surprisingly good remake of "Lisa's Rival," in many ways
   more realistic than the original, and with a far superior subplot.
   Executive Producer Mike Scully and his staff really seem to have hit their
   stride in the latter half of the "5F" episodes: hopefully this winning
   streak will continue as season 10 officially begins in a month.  (B+)

Brad Bizzolt:  We've seen both of those plots before; Lisa having a "rival"
   and Homer taking up a new crackpot moneymaking scheme.  There were a whole
   bunch of opportunities for great new ideas within these topics, but they
   just sorta fizzled away.  I give it this rating for the great one-liners
   that had little to do with the rest of the episode (Homer's "prayer",
   Marge's "Every Simpson Dance Now", etc); even when the plot tires, the
   twisted jokes never let up.  (B)

Solon Boomer-Jenks:  This episode was not good.  In fact, it was just plain
   lame.  It began as a bad rip-off of Summer of 4'2" (which is not one of my
   favorites either) only to become the subplot of Lisa's Rival gone bad.
   There were a few good jokes, though, which saves this episode from being
   "bad." This is, I believe the first time an episode has been done like
   this, where the story is totally a takeoff from other episodes.  I'll give
   it a  (C-)

Ben Collins:  A hard-core Simpsons fan could tune in to the middle of this
   episode and think it was a clip show. In fact, considering how much it
   borrowed from other episodes, especially "Lisa's Rival" (except that the
   main plot and subplot are switched), that may have been a good idea. It
   could have saved valuable animation labor. The main plot with Homer's wacky
   adventures in grease-selling was stupid, tiresome, and overdone; at least
   "Lisa's Rival"'s similar sugar subplot was funny. This episode is saved
   from a D or F with a few good gags (note that I said a FEW), a good (but
   not great) Lisa subplot, and well-placed social commentary on the push for
   kids and preteens to look and act "adult." I gave "Lisa's Rival" a B+; this
   one gets a  (C-)

Chris Courtois:  "Lard of the Dance" was a pleasant diversion which kept the
   show in the upturn it showed in the last 3 weeks of Season 9. It was nice
   to see a story which treated Lisa like a second-grader with second-grade
   doubts and insecurities. It was also nice to see Mike Scully pull off a
   wacky-Homer-scheme subplot without resurrecting Asshole Homer. Even nicer
   to see the subplot and main plots dovetail together at the end. While some
   of the meta- and self-referential humor was too obvious and in-your-face,
   overall this was a pleasant, if slight episode.  (B)

Nathan DeHoff:  Well, first of all, the lard subplot was not very original at
   all.  It was pretty much a rehash of earlier money-making schemes,
   especially the sugar scheme in "Lisa's Rival."  As for the main plot, it
   was a bit weak, but still enjoyable.  There was nothing particularly
   special about Lisa Kudrow's character, but the Springfieldianites'
   reactions to Alex were done fairly well. In terms of characterization,
   Homer was back to being humorously illogical, Lisa was able to demonstrate
   several aspects of her character [...] and Milhouse and Nelson were in good
   form.  Nelson's huckleberry/ass-kicking speech was particularly amusing.
   On the other hand, Marge was a bit over the top, and Skinner seemed more
   scatter-brained than usual.  Still, these were not especially irritating,
   just weird.  Not a particularly excellent episode, but I'd say it's worth a
   (B-)

Anthony Dean:  This was a nice break from the usual summer reruns. While I
   thought the lard plot was fairly lame, the Lisa plot was pretty on target,
   and enjoyable (Milhouse being one of the episode's highlights). About the
   only major complaint is the noticeably lackluster animation seen here; not
   a welcome sign for the upcoming season's batch of episodes.  (B)

Laura Drake:  I liked the grease sub-plot for the first two acts, until the
   third act with Groundskeeper Willy. I thought that was just stupid. But for
   the first two acts I thought that Homer snuck some funny lines in. As for
   the main plot, I thought it was pretty unbelievable and just a little
   funny, save for the parts with Milhouse. And I didn't think that Lisa
   Kudrow did a very good guest voice. However, it picked up in the third act
   with Lisa's little speech.  (B-)

Andrew Gill:  This has to be the most mediocre episode that I have ever seen.
   The Lisa (sub?) plot was good, but not great, but the Homer (main???
   someone do a time check.) plot was bad.  The "main" plot was silly, stupid,
   plodding and pointless -- until the third act, when it added grossly
   unrealistic and annoying to the list.  The "sub" plot was a good expansion
   on Lisa's character.  I remember trying to fit in in Junior High.  (I was
   able to eventually make it to the fringe of the "out" group, but then we
   moved, and ...)  Lisa's character was great, but Homer left much to be
   desired, and Bart was little more than a rag doll for Homer's operation.
   (C)

Tony Hill:  Sorry, Fox, but I think we have to regard this as the season
   premiere. A "back-to-school" ep in late August as part of season nine?
   This ep was a bit off balance.  Did Bart really seem to be concerned he was
   missing too much school?  And Skinner seemed nearly normal.  The main plot
   was a tired retread of Homer starting a goofball business -- remember
   Farmer Homer's Sugar?  And we're plagued once again with the "Lisa
   Problem."  [More on this in "Comments" -- Ed.] I give it a  (C+)

Joe Klemm:  The episode spent too much time on the Lisa plot line when the
   main plot concerns Homer and Bart going into the grease business. Other
   than the evil Acne Grease people, that plot line was clever. As for Lisa's,
   it's just another "Lisa's Rival." Hopefully, the season premiere ("The
   Wizard of Evergreen Terrace") will be better.  (C)

Haynes Lee:  The Homer plot is a rehash of the sugar plot but the Lisa plot is
   more fresh. She is finally acting like an 8-year old again.  (B)

Jake Lennington:  "LotD" was a good episode.  Even though it seemed like a
   rehash of Lisa's Rival, it did have its moments.  Homer was actually quite
   funny, but he wasn't as much of 'jerk-ass' as he usually is.  Ralph's eye
   patch scene was hilarious (I had to wear one of those patches for two
   years, ugh!)  Also, it was nice to see Sherri, Terri, and Allison as
   supporting characters, rather than just background material.  (B)

Andrew Levine:  I came watching this episode expecting to see another lame
   plot involving Homer.  I was surprised and delighted to find that the
   episode was really largely centered around Lisa.  The plot seemed like
   "Lisa's Rival" to some, but that's really only externally, considering that
   episode was about Lisa having an intellectual equal as a classmate, and
   this was someone with a higher social stance than Lisa.  I'm appalled that
   they totally recycled the Willie-in-the-ventilation-ducts Alien reference,
   but Bart being genuinely disappointed he was missing school was one of the
   funniest moments of the season!  In the end, Lisa teaches everyone it's hip
   to be square.  (B)

Patrick McGovern:  I am as anti-"Worst ep ever!!" as you can imagine, but this
   was close to the worst ("Bart gets an Elephant" ... but "Little Lost Lisa"
   is pretty much tied with it). The 1st act wasn't that funny, Lisa Kudrow
   did an OK job, but Bart & Homer ... bleeeechhh.  The second act was bad.
   Watching Lisa trying to be "Cool" is always a chore, but all of the stuff
   surrounding it made it worse. The Bart & Homer subplot was also really bad.
   However, the 3rd act was just INSULTING. Although a clever reference that
   goes back 6 years (Milhouse's old girlfriend, Samantha, is with him AND
   uglier than ever!), the ending was disgusting, revolting and
   stomach-churning. I couldn't watch it again.  (D-)

Mark A. Richey:  Neither the finale of season 9, nor the premiere of season 10
   (let's call it the one and only episode of season 9.5), LOTD is a clever
   and amusing episode.  The two plots of the show were both quite funny, even
   if the entire show was similar to [1F17] "Lisa's Rival" (the appearance of
   Alison reinforces that).  Lisa Kudrow did a very good job as Alex,
   Milhouse's continued obsession with Lisa was amusing, and the grease racket
   was very funny (as was Marge's idea of emu farms and "Every Simpson dance
   now").  This episode made season 9.5 a winner.  (B+)

Tom Rinschler:  For an episode that was obviously "Lisa's Rival" meets "Summer
   of 4' 2", the writers managed to pull something a bit different out of the
   mix.  And for once, the subplot was well integrated into the main plot.
   However, although the plot and characterization were well done, it was a
   bit short on laughs; but there were enough of them not to sink the episode
   entirely.  (B)

Aaron Varhola:  More good stuff from a first-time writer.  Jane O'Brien
   handles Lisa with aplomb, bringing out her social insecurity in two ways:
   her feeling inferior to her friends, but also in bits of selfishness seen
   in 3F03, 3F11 and 5F15.  Many of the jokes were funny, although the lard
   subplot was weak, even compared to 1F17. Lisa Kudrow did a good job as
   Alex; I've been very impressed with her non-"Friends" work recently.  (B)

Yours Truly:  One could argue that this show is as recycled as Homer's grease,
   but "Lard of the Dance" for the most part is a new spin on old material.
   New girl Alex is more interesting than she first appears, being shallow and
   a bit vain, but without the usual sense of pettiness and nastiness.  Lisa,
   the innocent babe to Alex's worldly party girl, is also written well.
   There are some minor problems with pacing, but this is a good start from
   rookie writer Jane O'Brien.  (B)

>> Musical references

Tony Hill:  Willie hummed "Loch Lomond" while he cleaned up.


E. J. Smith:  The song is playing in the Gymnasium during the school dance is
   "I Can Love You Like That" by All-4-One.


>> Meta-reference corner

Benjamin Robinson:  There are two meta-references to the fact that "Friends"
   star Lisa Kudrow plays Alex the New Girl.  First, she mentions that has
   always liked the name, "Lisa."

   Secondly, she tells Lisa not to be "such a Phoebe" (meaning "don't be such
   an airhead").  Kudrow plays ditsy Phoebe Buffay on "Friends."


>> Maybe we can call it a "summer" season episode

John Jacobs wonders:  I thought this was a season 10 episode, but now FOX is
   saying the season premier is tomorrow [September 20, 1998].  Is Lard of the
   dance a season 9 or a season 10 episode?


Eric Endres sez:  There is no doubt about it. Lard belongs to season Nen.


Jake Lennington writes:  No, its a Tine episode.


Ben Collins rides this train of thought to its natural destination:
   Interesting theory. So "Blood Feud" (July 1991) ran in Season Twee, and
   "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes" (August 1992) came out in Season Throur.
   Too bad there was no Fourve, Fix, Sixven, Seveight, or Egnine. Even if
   there's no 11, we may want to see a Televen, or even an Elelve.


Brad Bizzolt:  I'd like to see an Eleventeen myself.


Oh, you wanted a serious answer.  Okay, Nicolas Di Candia has your serious
   answer right here:  It was produced for season 9, as shows in its 5F20 p-
   code. It was then held over for season 10 (just like The Wizard of
   Evergreen Terrace, Bart the Mother and When You Wish Upon a Star). But it
   was shown as a "summer original" before season 10 started (but after season
   9 ended). "The Simpsons Forever" lists it under season 10. SNPP.com and
   www.fox.com/thesimpsons list it under season 9. [We've since moved it
   "officially" to season 10 -- Ed.] I prefer to refer to it as season 9
   because it is consistent to "Blood Feud" and "Brother, Can You Spare Two
   Dimes?" being in seasons 2 and 3 (both were shown as summer originals like
   Lard of the Dance).


Brad Dancer opines:  I'm going with FOX's averages and Nielsen's averages --
   in the end, those are the only ones that matter.  We can argue about it all
   we want -- no one said it was a season finale, simply a summer special not
   part of the 98-99 season and not exactly part of the 97-98 season either.


[I, personally, think of it as the lone season 9.5 episode -- Ed.]


>> Who died and made you lord?

Mark A. Richey:  Lord of the Dance -- That would be Michael Flatley.  He used
   to headline the supremely popular "Riverdance" Irish dancing tour, until
   his ego swelled too large for the show's producers.  He left and formed his
   own troupe, which he immodestly called "Lord of the Dance", with himself in
   the title role.  He recently stopped performing, but still runs the show
   behind the scenes.


>> Mmm, mmm, grease

Lee Johnson:  "Lard of the Dance" contained a quick reference to grease being
   an ingredient used in the making of baby food, presumably as a cynical barb
   aimed at industries who cut corners at the unwitting consumer's expense.
   This brought to mind a similar joke in a past episode, when Bart discovers
   that his bones have grown brittle thanks to the school cafeteria having
   switched from real milk to "Malk," a vitamin-deficient substitute.

   Both of these little references -- especially if taken together -- suggest
   (at least in my mind) a conscious awareness on the part of the
   writers/producers about such practices, the most famous of which was Nestle
   Corporation's unscrupulous distribution and aggressive marketing of baby
   milk substitutes (which are nutritionally insufficient if used by
   themselves and which are often unsanitary in the making) in a number of
   'Third World' countries -- a practice which many say resulted in mass
   malnutrition and death.

   Nestle is the parent corporation of the Butterfinger company, whose candy
   bars Bart and Homer happily plug in a series of commercials.

   So ... what, I wonder, was the attitude on the part of the writers who
   included these details? A quasi-conscious expression of guilt? A satirical
   jab at their own sponsor? Or just a coincidence?


>> "Pretension" for kids

Mark A. Richey:  Not a real perfume, but it does refer to the way the famous
   fashion designer/perfumer tends to give his perfumes rather pretentious one
   word names, and advertise them with bizarre, nonsensical commercials.


>> "Don't be such a Phoebe"

Mark A. Richey writes:  "Friends" -- Lisa Kudrow, who played Alex, costars on
   this popular sitcom about twenty-somethings in New York.  She plays Phoebe,
   the scatterbrained masseuse/folk singer, who tends not to get the big
   picture much of the time (which explains Alex's "Phoebe" putdown).


>> It's new Achievable Chest Barbie!

Benjamin Robinson explains Lisa's choice in dolls:  For years, little girls
   across America have played with Barbie dolls, hoping one day to grow up
   looking like her.  They're not likely to get their wish, since Barbie has
   physical proportions no earthly woman could match.  For example, Barbie has
   a 36" chest, and a 16" waist. Some of this has a practical reason behind
   it; the doll's limbs must be skinnier than normal so clothing (which can't
   be proportionally shrunk) will fit correctly.  But for the most part
   Barbie's looks are dictated by the prevailing winds of fashion.  This
   hasn't sat too well with social scientists, who worry that girls who don't
   fit the Barbie mold will grow up thinking that they are inferior and ugly.
   In response to this trend, Mattel has gradually fattened Barbie up so that
   she now looks more like a genetically engineered supermodel, instead of
   something unrealistic.  A few niche toymakers have gone even further,
   producing dolls that look as close to real (albeit attractive) women as
   production methods allow.


Joe Klemm adds:  So far, I haven't seen any sign of the new look as of yet.


>> Another rule of the schoolyard

Benjamin Robinson:  I thought it was interesting that Sherri and Terri would
   hang out with Lisa, Allison, and Janey.  When I went to school, there was
   an invisible line separating the grades.  You made friends with the kids in
   your grade but not the grade below (too babyish) or the grade above (who
   thought -you- were too babyish).  Perhaps Lisa, Sherri, and Terri forged a
   cross-grade friendship while waiting for Moe to rescue them in "Das Bus
   (5F11)."


>> But all the other kids get to watch!

Andrew Gill:  "The McLaughlin Group" is a political commentary aired on PBS.
   Unlike most PBS shows, however, it is highly partisan and holds no
   allegiance to truth, liberal or conservative.  John McLaughlin hosts the
   show, which poses such even handed questions as "QUESTION: Why don't the
   American People believe that President Clinton is a big fat weenie? (OK, I
   don't remember any questions off hand)".  Typically, "debate" is
   superficial and has nothing to do with the conclusion.  I think that I know
   why Lisa (at least, I know why I do when I catch it) watches it: to laugh.
   On a side note, I've always felt that the fat bald commentator looks a bit
   like Homer.


>> Yes, there is something worse than airline food.

Mark Richey writes:  In late 1846, a group of settlers, the Donner Party,
   trying to reach California were trapped at the base of the Sierra Nevada
   Mountains by the onset of winter.  Unfortunately for them, the winter of
   1846-47 proved to be one of the harshest in history.  They quickly
   extinguished their provision supply, and as starvation set in, many of them
   died.  The remaining party members began to eat the dead (yes, it's gross).
   There have been accusations that some members didn't wait for nature to
   take it's course at all times.  At any rate, it's not one of the more jolly
   moments in American history.


Solon Boomer-Jenks proudly notes:  Yes, they got snowed in at Truckee Lake in
   the Sierra Nevadas, but the reason they were there in the winter was
   because of slow moving, and taking wrong routs through Utah.  It's a proud
   part of Utah history.


Chris Courtois adds:  There's a State Park marking the winter campsite just
   off of Interstate 80 as you pass Truckee.


>> Maybe he would have been better off on Marge's emu farm

Andrew Gill points out:  Emu farming is really hot right now.  ["Right now"
   being January 25, 1999 -- Ed.] Yahoo! has an entire section devoted to it:
   <http://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Companies/Food/Meat_and_Poult
   ry/Poultry/Ratites/Emu/>

   Emu/Ostrich meat is being sold as ``the other red meat,'' since it's much
   leaner than beef, and each emu has much more meat than any other fowl.


Jeff Dean:  I had the pleasure of trying some ostrich meat last summer at a
   Very Fancy Restaurant. It was quite good, but the price was outrageous. I
   believe six domino-sized pieces cost $25, though it did come garnished with
   some colorful flowers.


>> Oh, grow up, already

Aaron Varhola:  Lisa [...] wants to grow up on her own terms.  Note that in
   "Summer of 4'2", Lisa only briefly took on a new persona; only her cool
   clothes remained soon after she met her new friends, who accepted her for
   who she was.  In this episode, Lisa felt rushed to conform to Alex and the
   other "Fashion Club" (to make a Daria reference) members, and the result
   was uncharacteristic behavior, such as her threatening to give Milhouse a
   tonguectomy for not going with her to the dance.  Lisa quickly realizes
   what's happening to her, though, and Alex doesn't realize that the kids are
   going to do what kids everywhere do at dances ... line up with boys on one
   side of the gym and girls on the other, not dancing. :)

   (I'm surprised that Alex didn't know that Lisa's on the cutting edge of
   trends such as girls taking up the saxophone, or fashion - Lisa was the
   cover girl for "The Good Girl Look", the spring fashion preview in the
   February 27, 1996 issue of New York magazine).


>> Cartoon physics strike again

According to John Wellington:  Since the grease was being sucked to its
   destination outside the school, rather than being pumped from its source in
   the kitchen, the bursting hose should not have occurred.  When Willie was
   strangling Homer, the worst that should have happened was the hose would
   collapse between the vacuum and Homer's throat.  If Bart and Homer had
   dragged a pump to the kitchen to send the grease out, then the hose would
   have indeed burst between that pump and Homer's throat.


Andrew Krupowski theorized:  The only way for that error to not be a mistake
   if you tried to argue that  the hose wasn't completely blocked off while
   Willie strangled Homer.

   Of course, then you'd require that the grease be unable to get through the
   smaller gap. With the "pieces of bacon" still in it, that's actually
   plausible ... hmm ...


>> The problem with Lisa

According to Tony Hill:  This is the main problem in dealing with "The
   Simpsons."  Lisa is simply too precocious to be a second grader.  So are
   her friends.  The show would be much more credible if she were Bart's older
   sister.  The personalities of the two are more compatible with this.  If
   Lisa were a sixth grader, she would still be precocious, but not as
   unbelievably so as she is now.  The principal asking a second grader to
   take charge of and then supervise the school dance?  HELLO!


Eric Sansoni argues:  Never once has it bothered me that Lisa (or Bart, or the
   other kids) act older than their ages.  It's a cartoon.  The characters can
   behave like true originals.  They don't have to be limited to what is
   realistic for their real-life counterparts.  It is usually more
   entertaining to see child characters act older than their age than to see
   them behave immaturely.  So many comic strips or cartoons from the past
   focus on precocious children (such as Peanuts, particularly Linus, a good
   counterpart for Lisa).  There's something artistic and intrinsically
   interesting about hearing wise words come from the mouths of babes.
   Perhaps there's something profound about innocence paired with wisdom.  I
   also admire the flexibility with which Simpsons allows itself to treat its
   child characters.  They can make a whole range of conflicts and behavior
   from that of childhood to young adult work for these characters.  The
   school and the children are more general symbols than specific slices from
   a certain year and age.  I don't consider this a "problem" at all.  I
   praise and admire Simpsons for this particular creative choice.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Grease


Don Del Grande:  Are Sherri and Terri's voices slightly different?  It seems
   to me that there's now a way to tell them apart.


Tom Rinschler:  This is Allison Taylor's first major role since "Lisa's
   Rival."

	on grease, we go for one last big score?
Homer:	Wait a minute.  The boy's right!  I can't quit now!  Aww 
	... you always know just what to say to cheer me up.  Emu 
	farm?  [laughs] You're priceless, Marge!
	[Homer and Bart leave the room, and Marge grumbles to 
	herself]

% Elsewhere, at Springfield Elementary, Nelson gives a rather strange
% lecture to Wendell, Ralph, Lewis, and Database.

Nelson:	The thing about huckleberries is, once you've had fresh, 
	you'll never go back to canned. [Principal Skinner walks 
	up] Nuh, um ... uh, so anyway, I kicked the guy's ass. 
	[Skinner nods and leaves] Now, if the berries are too 
	tart, I just dust them with confectioner's sugar.
-- "Lard of the Dance"

% The group murmurs in agreement, but are interrupted by Lisa's voice,
% greeting them with "Hey, guys."  They turn their heads to see Lisa,
% wearing the black dress she had rejected before ... as well as
% lipstick, earrings, and platform shoes.  She walks toward them,
% slightly off-balance, an uneasy smile on her face.

Wendell:	Hi, Lisa.
Nelson:		Are you all right?
Lisa:		No doubt!  Can't a girl fabulize herself before the 
		big dance?
Nelson:		You're earlobe's bleeding.
Lisa:		Oh.  So, I guess major muffins like yourselves all 
		have dates, huh?
Wendell:	You better believe it.
Lisa:		Really?  All of you?
Database:	Uh, we all have dates, Lisa.
Lewis:		Everyone does.
Ralph:		Even me!
Lisa:		Unbelievable.
-- "Lard of the Dance"

% Lisa, shocked, takes a little spill in her platform shoes, falling
% over backwards.  Later, in the nurses' office, Milhouse is about to
% undergo his usual wedgie-removal treatment.  As the nurse goes to
% get her forceps, Lisa rushes inside, panting.

Lisa:		Milhouse, oh, I've been looking all over for you.  
		Heh, heh, listen, you've always had a crush on me, 
		right?  Well, this is your lucky day, 'cause you're 
		gonna take me to the dance, pretty great, huh?  See 
		ya!
Milhouse:	Oh, but I can't!  I've already asked somebody.
Lisa:		[growing frustration] So un-ask her.
Milhouse:	But that wouldn't ...
Lisa:		[grabbing Milhouse's shirt] You're taking me, you 
		got that?  And it's gonna be a magical evening!
		[at that moment, Lisa sees the sweat pouring off 
		Milhouse's face, and, in Milhouse's glasses, sees 
		the reflection of her own "glamorous" facade, 
		realizing what she's become]
		Oh!  What am I doing?  This isn't me!  I'm sorry, 
		Milhouse. 
		[runs off]
Milhouse:	I'm free next weekend!  There's plenty of Milhouse 
		to go around!

%
% Act three.  At the Simpson home, Homer heats up his car, to which is
% attached six oil drums.  Pulling into the driveway, he stops.

Homer:	All right, son.  We're about to embark on our most 
	difficult mission.  Let's bow our heads in prayer.  Dear 
	Lord, I know You're busy, seeing as how You can watch 
	women changing clothes and all that.  But if You help us 
	steal this grease tonight, I promise we'll donate half the 
	profits to charity.
Bart:	Dad, He's not stupid.
Homer:	All right, screw it, let's roll!
	[the car squeals onto the road, where all six drums fall 
	off the car and roll down the street]
	Hmm ... I knew I should've attached those somehow.
-- "Lard of the Dance"

% Lisa sits in her room, looking through a microscope.  She's envious
% of the paramecia she's looking at, since they have no dating or
% dancing pressures.  Suddenly, the paramecia begin pairing up with
% each other, encircling each other in what appears to be a dance. 
% Lisa groans, and her mother enters.

Marge:	Lisa!  I made you some homemade Pepsi for the dance!  It's 
	a little thick, but the price is right!
Lisa:	Thanks, Mom, but I told you I'm not going.
Marge:	Oooh, so you don't have a date.  You can still go and have 
	a wonderful time.
Lisa:	You don't understand, I don't belong there.  The other 
	girls are already into fashion and make-up and dating ... 
	they make me feel like a little baby.
Marge:	[hugs Lisa] Aw, honey, a baby couldn't have organized a 
	big school dance.  Unless, it was especially skilled ... 
	or one of those super-babies from Brazil.
Lisa:	Forget it Mom, I'm not going.
Marge:	But they're counting on you to take tickets.  And if you 
	sit there with a brave little smile and a festive bow ... 
	why you could be the belle of the ball!
Lisa:	Mom, you can't possibly believe that.
Marge:	I have to, honey.  Or, you can stay here, and we'll have 
	our own dance. [to C&C 'Music' Factory] Every Simpson 
	dance now!  Bump, bump, bump ...
Lisa:	I'll go.
-- "Lard of the Dance"

% Homer and Bart, meanwhile, drive their greasemobile as planned.  The
% two pull up to Springfield Elementary where, according to Bart, the
% kitchen grease traps have never been emptied. The boys begin their
% covert operations.  Bart flips the switch, turning the hose suction
% on.  Homer, hose in hand, looks curiously inside, wondering where
% the suction is, and gets his face sucked inside.  Freeing himself
% from its grip, his appearance startles Bart, as one of his eyeballs
% is bulging from his skull.
%
% Inside the school, Lisa (with a festive bow in her hair) sits at a
% table just outside the gymnasium, stamping hands with a star and
% generally doing her best Laura Silverman impression.  Milhouse and
% his date (a rather tall girl with dental headgear) walk up to Lisa's
% table.

Milhouse:	Wow, Lisa.  I really admire your guts.  You came 
		here all by yourself at the risk of being labeled a 
		dateless wonder.
		[gets his hand stamped by Lisa rather hard] Ow!
Lisa:		[excessively pleasant] It slipped.
-- Hitting raw nerves, "Lard of the Dance"

% The two walk inside the gym, and Lisa, at the table, takes the bow
% off her head and tosses it into the trash.  "Oh, it's going to be a
% long night," she laments.
%
% Meanwhile, in the school cafeteria, Homer and Bart sneak about. 
% Bart asks where the hose is.  "Bringing up the rear," Homer answers. 
% He has the hose attached to his backside, which he wags excitedly. 
% Opening the range, he plants the hose into a sea of grease
% underneath.

Homer:	And now, we wait.  So ... is this your school?
Bart:	Well, it used to be.
-- "Lard of the Dance"

% At that moment, Willie enters.  At the kitchen sink, he begins to
% whistle while scrubbing under his armpits with a Brillo pad and Ajax
% soap.  The Simpson men attempt to sneak away, but Willie notices
% them.

Willie:	Eek!  I mean, ach!  I mean ... what are you doin' here?
Homer:	Uh, buh, buh, we're new foreign exchange students from ... 
	uh, um ... Scotland!
Willie:	Saints be praised, I'm from Scotland!  Where do ya hail 
	from?
Homer:	Uh ... North ... Kilttown.
Willie:	No foolin'!  I'm from North Kilttown!  Do you know Angus 
	McCloud?
Homer:	Wait a minute!  There's no Angus McCloud in North 
	Kilttown!  Why, you're not from Scotland at all!
Willie:	Ach, don't be daft.  I was born and rai ... [notices the 
	hose] Hey, what the? [gasps] My retirement grease!  No!  
	You thievin' grease bandits!  I'll kill ya!  [Homer and 
	Bart make their escape through the ventilation ducts] Wait 
	up!
-- "Lard of the Dance"

% Willie, enraged, chases after them, and manages to grab Homer's leg
% while inside.

Not so fast boy-o!  Well, if it was up to me, I'd let ya go.  But the 
lads have a temper, and they've been drinkin' all day!  [curls his 
fingers into a fist]
-- Groundskeeper Willie, "Lard of the Dance"

% Willie begins punching Homer with his "lads".  Homer begs him to
% stop, so instead Willie begins to strangle him with the grease hose,
% at which Homer's loose eye bulges out of his skull again.  Back
% inside the school, Skinner emerges from the gym and talks with Lisa.

Skinner:	Lisa!  I have to run home.  I need you to keep an 
		eye on the dance.
Lisa:		Oh, I don't want to go in there, with all the happy 
		dancing couples ...
Skinner:	Normally I wouldn't ask, but, uh, it's an emergency.  
		Mother has a junebug cornered in the basement and 
		she needs me to finish it off.  Come on, chop, chop.
Lisa:		All right, all right, DMY!
Skinner:	I know what that means, young lady!
-- "Lard of the Dance"

% Sighing, Lisa pushes open the door and looks inside.  Strangely, she
% sees all the boys on one side, looking just as awkward as the girls,
% who stand together on the opposite side of the gym.  Alex comes up
% to her.

Alex:	Oh, Lisa, it's terrible.  Okay, this dance has gone 
	Titanic!
Lisa:	What happened?
Alex:	Well, the boys and girls are, like, afraid of each other.  
	They're acting like a bunch of ...
Lisa:	Kids?
Alex:	I know!  What is up with that?
Lisa:	It's because they are kids!  And so are we!  Come on, 
	Alex, we've only got nine, maybe ten years tops where we 
	can giggle in church, and chew with our mouths open and go 
	days without bathing!  We'll never have that freedom 
	again.
Alex:	Mmm.  Listen, you can giggle and stink all you want, but I 
	have a credit card, so [blows raspberry] on you.
-- The model of maturity, "Lard of the Dance"

% Alex walks off.  At that very moment, Willie continues to wrestle
% with Homer in the ventilation system.  Bart stands nearby, pointing
% out that the hose Willie is using to strangle Homer with has built
% up an enormous amount of grease behind them.  The hose swells, then
% explodes in a fountain of grease, shooting the three through the
% vents.
%
% In the gymnasium, the children look up to see tiny flakes falling
% from one of the vents; it's grease, being cut into pieces by the fan
% blades.

Martin:	Look!  It's snowing!
Ralph:	[catching a flake of grease on his tounge] This snowflake 
	tastes like fish sticks!
-- "Lard of the Dance"

% The children enjoy the distraction, until screams are heard echoing
% from places unknown.  It's Willie, Bart, and Homer, who each crash
% into the gym in a sea of grease, pouring out of three separate air
% ducts onto the floor.  Milhouse picks up some and tastes it, while
% Nelson starts  having fun throwing it around.

Milhouse:	It's like a hamburger milkshake!
Nelson:		Here comes a greaseball!
Luigi:		[walking in] Hey!  Luigi bring-a you kids-a free 
		pizza!  Why do you hafta make-a the fun, huh?
-- "Lard of the Dance"

% As kids begin throwing it around, making greasemen out of it, and
% having all sorts of disgusting fun, Homer runs about, trying to take
% it all back and keep it in his pockets.  Alex finds the whole
% situation disgusting.

Alex:	You're playing in grease?  Yargh!
Lisa:	Oh, act your age. [pelts her with a greaseball, laughs]
-- "Lard of the Dance"

% Alex stares in disgust for a moment, but then declares, "You are so
% dead," and laughs, chasing Lisa with a ball of grease.  Lisa then
% hits Alex in the face with another greaseball, prompting her to
% complain, over the credits, that "There was bacon in that!"  It was
% a magical evening.
