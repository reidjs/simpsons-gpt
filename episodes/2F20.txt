===============================================================================
Where is Smithers' collection of Malibu Stacy dolls?  {dh}

Smithers used to own a Yorkshire terrier in 8F04.  {dh}

Brockman's news report at the beginning shows Burns is transferred to
Springfield General Hospital, but when Homer assaults him, the
dispatcher says Homer is at the Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital.

Marvin Monroe is dead?  {dh2}

Maggie is not at the dinner table.  {dh}

Since when has Homer had a toolshed?  He usually keeps his tools in the
garage.  {dh2}

Rickets is caused by Vitamin D deficiency, not necessarily a lack of
sunlight.  (see below) {ddg}

Homer only has rickets in that one scene.  {rl}

The ropes tied to Burns' sun blocking machine should pull all the cars
down the hill.  {dh}

The ropes vanish shortly after their use.  {dh}

When the sun-blocker was removed, the shadow over the town doesn't
change.  {ddg}

Smithers' facial stubble disappears and reappears {dh2}.

When he's in the confession booth, Smithers' neck looks too long.  {ml}

Smithers' coat changes into a jacket in the confession booth.  {dh}

Smithers isn't wearing a bow tie when arrested, but he has one at the
police station.  {dh}

Sideshow Mel's pipe appears out of nowhere.  {dh2}

Krusty's TV remote disappears.  {dh}

Wiggum isn't playing solitaire when Sideshow Mel and Krusty come in, but
later he is.  {rl}

Grampa's rest home sure got rebuilt quickly.  {wb}

Jasper didn't have a wooden leg in 8F18, 1F06, and 2F19.  {dh}

Scott Christian's microphone's FOX logo changes.  {rl}

When we see Dr. Colossos in the jail cell, Smithers is not with him.
But as soon as Colossos leaves, Smithers appears in the cell.  {dh2}

Doesn't Barney still make money from Barney's Bowlerama, Plow King, or
B-Sharps royalties?  {em}

Lie detectors don't look like that.  And if the person saying the lie
believes it to be true, it shows up as the truth.  {th}

Moe says he's going to look at the Sears catalog, but they discontinued
their catalogs in 1993.  {th}

Willy's fingers have never been arthritic before now.  In fact, he
shoots a weapon in 2F11.  {dh}

Wiggum's badge is missing in some scenes.  {dh}

A fired bullet can't be matched against an unfired one with any degree
of certainty.  {ddg}

Chief Wiggum has "the bullet" - but it's still in its casing; somehow,
they pulled an UNFIRED bullet out of Burns!  {ddg}

How does the bullet stay suspended in mid-baggie?  {dh2}

The name "Bouvier" isn't in the DNA computer.  However, the names
"Powell" and "Simpson" appear twice.  (And "Murphy" is still in there...
) Also, "Brockman" is spelled "Brockmen".  {ddg}

The periodic table of the elements in the lab is incorrectly drawn.
{dh2}

Why were Aaronson and Zykowski from 2F10 not in the DNA computer?

Wiggum handcuffs Homer's hands behind his back, yet later he's
handcuffed in the front.  {dh}

The order box moves from its original location after Wiggum orders his
food.  The take-out order box later disappears while Jasper's car plows
the paddy wagon.  {dh}

The overhang at the Krusty Burger initially covers only a small part of
the driveway; in the end, it covers more than half.  {th}

The establishing shot shows a 90 degree turn from the order box to the
window, yet Wiggum drives straight from one to the other.  {th}

The paddy wagon changes shape after it tips over.  {dh}

How does Homer get out of his handcuffs and leg irons?  {em}

Dr. Riviera's clipboard turns into a flashlight.  {dh}

When Homer is confronting Burns in the hospital, his shirt is first
blue, then white.  {dh2}

When Homer bends down over Burns, his sidehairs are not in their typical
"M" shape.  {rl}

Lou speeds off on his motorcycle, yet Lisa arrives at the hospital
first.  {dh}

The doorknob on room 2F20 moved while Lisa pleads with the mob.  {th}

In 2F16, when Burns confronts the shooter, Burns' shadow moves at a
_different_ time than in this episode.  {cm}

When Marge puts Maggie in the car, the window is half way down, but when
Burns leans in, it's almost all the way down.  {jas}

It would have been exceedingly hard for Maggie to pull the trigger with
just the little finger of her left hand.  {ddg}

When Lisa draws the letters "S" and "W" on her notepad, she reverses the
positions of the letters.  {dh2}

The layout of the people in the hospital room changes several times.
{rl}

Wiggum's arm is no longer in an arm cast and his sleeves reappear.  {dh}

Wiggum's badge keeps switching sides.  {dh}

So how do Groundskeeper Willie and Mr. Largo get their jobs back, who
pays for the restoration of the Retirement Castle, and how is Bart's
treehouse repaired?  {ddg}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Harry Wareing: IMHO this was not a great episode, the parody of "The
    Fugitive" was good but it seemed flat.  The first part was the best
    of the two.

Mark Greenan: That was the worst Simpsons ever.  I would've rather seen
    a old repeat.  If you hadn't figured it out before you can figure it
    out with in the first few minutes.  I would've expected more from
    the talented Simpsons writers.

David Neilson: Overall, the episode was okay.  Not as good as Part One
    but better than most of last season.  The reference to "The
    Fugitive" and "Basic Instinct" were good and the Dr. Death stuff was
    great, but other than that, average.

Justin Goeres: I thought the solution was good.  I think, also, however,
    that perhaps the half-hour format forced the conclusion (the episode
    in general, really) to be a bit pushed time-wise.  I'm not going to
    "complain" about it, though.  (Wouldn't want to disappoint Bart...)

Jeff Archibald: OK, OK, so the plot wasn't stellar but...THE MOVIE
    REFERENCES WERE GREAT!  The Fugitive, Basic Instinct, but by far,
    the best reference was to the final episode of Twin Peaks!  That was
    priceless.  Kudos to the writers.  I was ROTFL.

Jodi Klebick: Oh, what a disappointment!  I expected more from The
    Simpsons than this fallacy of justice!  How can you have a crime
    with no punishment?  Those in the know realize that only Sideshow
    Mel was brilliant enough to undertake this heinous crime.  Thumbs
    down!

Jim Smith: You would expect a more original ending from the Simpsons
    head honchos, but the rest of the episode was terrific.  Smithers's
    opening scene was worth the ridiculous parody just to see "Speedway
    Squad -- in Color"!  Doctor Colossus was terrific too.  I must be
    Simpson-starved though, because every scene had me cracking up.

Keith Rubuliak: Give me a break!  Could there ever possibly ever have
    been a more hyped and commercialized episode?  I mean, why did not
    they make it an MCI operator the one who shot Mr. Burns?

Jym Dyer: I've come to expect much higher standards from "The Simpsons".
    Here's hoping this is but an aberration.

Don Del Grande: Grade: B. Just an ordinary episode that happened to be
    the solution to Who Shot Mr. Burns.  Not nearly as good as Part One.

Aaron Varhola: This episode necessarily had its focus on eliminating the
    other suspects, and was very rushed; it could have been an hour,
    easily.  However, it was funny, and the Twin Peaks takeoff was just
    plain weird.  (How did they get Lisa's voice like that?).  B+; would
    be higher if an hour long.

Greg Lam: Grade: B+.  A good, not great episode.  I'm not bitter about
    the ending.  Great references: Fugitive, Basic Instinct, Twin Peaks.
    (How long before Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump references?).
    However, way too many flashbacks and the Tito Puente song went on
    much too long.

Bob Yantosca: Other than "The Fugitive" reference, I thought that the
    episode was flat.  I actually thought the writers would have more
    imagination than to have Maggie shoot Burns.

Benjamin Robinson: This episode just about lives up to the hype, which
    is no faint praise considering the amount of hype.  It deftly
    balances the tasks of explaining the crime, eliminating suspects one
    by one, and cramming in plenty of good jokes.  The
    "Dallas"-referenced opener was terrific; in fact, this was a good
    effort all around (7.9/11 -> A).

Ricardo Lafaurie: Was it just me or was the environment for Part Two
    noticeably and uncomfortably different?  It looks like Oakley &
    Weinstein have done the ol' "first part good, second part worse"
    thing again, on a broader basis.  I did enjoy the lie detector and
    Speed Racer knockoff.  The Latin music ruled.  Grade: B+.

Dominik Halas: Superb!  Dare I say it, even better than part one!  All
    the loose ends were tied up, (ie the sun blocker), the references
    were _perfect_, and the best part was, it seemed as if they'd been
    reading all our theories!  My only complaint is that Dr. Nick
    Riviera's voice seemed off.  Grade: A/A+.

Keith Palmer: While perhaps not quite as sparkling as WSMB 1 (Tito
    Puente's song was a rather big celebrity distraction), this episode
    was still quite funny (Speedway Squad was a laugh riot).  A
    generally fitting conclusion to an excellent cliff-hanger.  Grade:
    A/A-.

Warren Hagey: I thought that this episode was a bit of a letdown after
    all of the hype that it got.  There were some good scenes, but some
    of it was quite unnecessary, such as taking all of that time with
    Tito Puente.  I'm hoping that the rest of the shows this season are
    better.  B-.

Tony Hill: I thought the episode was riotously funny, so much so that I
    laughed out loud even the second time through.  It was especially
    cool to see Homer become a suspect and the references to "The
    Fugitive" and the O.J.  Simpson case.  I give it an A.

Yours truly: Somewhat disappointing for the season opener, although it
    improved upon rewatching.  The references were really quite
    outstanding, particularly Eddie threatening Willy in the "Basic
    Instinct" scene.  I liked the salsa song, and _was_ satisfied with
    the culprit.  Grade: C+.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Rickets

Jenny Wenzke explains, "Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children
    and osteomalacia in adults.  Rickets is characterized by soft,
    pliable bones and osteomalacia by weakened bones, easily fractured.
    (so actually, Homer would not have had rickets) Vitamin D's function
    in the body is to maintain adequate levels of calcium and phosphate
    in the blood, to be used for mineralization of bone.  If the levels
    are inadequate, bones will not be develop properly and be much
    weaker.  Vitamin D deficiency can result from not enough Vitamin D
    in the diet and/or lack of exposure to sunlight.  UV light causes
    the conversion of molecules in the skin into compounds that can be
    used for the synthesis of Vitamin D."

>> The KMEX van

Pat Maher notes that KMEX is the local Univision affiliate in Los
    Angeles.  Another tidbit for the "Where is Springfield?" file?

>> Smithers' St. Patrick's Day parade comment

Several readers pointed out that some cities in the US (most notably
    Boston) managed to ban homosexual groups from marching in the
    parade.  Smithers' comment would therefore seem to be more proof of
    his sexual orientation.

>> The "Chez Guevara"

The bar where Tito Puente plays is a pun on Che Guevara.  Aaron Varhola
    explains, "Ernesto `Che' Guevara was Fidel Castro's aide-de-camp in
    the Cuban Revolution (aka the guy on the `Rage Against the Machine'
    shirts).  Guevara was killed fomenting revolution in Paraguay in the
    late 1960's."

>> Lisa's voice in Wiggum's dream

The characters in Agent Cooper's dreams had the same eerie vocal
    quality.  Nathaniel Irons explains how it's done: "They record the
    voices, going forward, and then reverse them.  Then they play the
    reversed lines back to the actor until the actor can approximate
    them by speaking backward (although some things, like a hard T
    sound, are damned near impossible to pronounce backwards).  Then the
    actor says the lines backwards, which get reversed _again_ and
    create the effect."

>> The Spanish in Tito's revenge

According to Ricardo Lafaurie, the Spanish lines sung in Tito's revenge
    translate as:

    - Con un corazo'n de perro -- with the soul of a dog
    - El diablo con dinero -- the devil with money
    - Adios viejo -- goodbye old man

>> Homer's "Alexander Haig" T-shirt

    - Tony Hill notes, "Alexander Haig, White House chief of staff under
      Richard Nixon and Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan, was
      briefly a presidential candidate in 1987-88.  Many thought he
      would try to be a dictator if elected, recalling how he usurped
      authority when Reagan was shot: `I am in control here.'"

% At the Simpson house, Grampa sits in the kitchen.  Marge runs in.

Marge: Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up in the back yard but the
       gun wasn't there.  Have you seen it?
  Abe: You accuse me of everything around here?
       "Who put slippers in the dishwasher?"
       "Who threw a cane at the TV?"
       {"Who fell into the china hutch?"}
Marge: I was just asking if you'd seen it.  There's no need to be a
       prickly pear.  {[walks out]}
  Abe: {[pulls gun from shirt] Oh, you're the bee's knees, baby.  I
       missed you bad.}
Marge: {Are you talking to me, Grampa?}
  Abe: {Um...yes?}
Marge: {Ew...}

% Wiggum racks his brain at the station.

Wiggum: We're still not close.  Boy!  This is going to be an all-night
        brain-buster.
         [rolls chair over to coffee machine]
        Oh, we're out of coffee!  Oh, well, I'll just drink this warm
        cream.
         [does so, falls asleep]
-- With stained whiskers, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

% Wiggum dreams he's sitting on an office chair on a stage eating a
% donut.  Lisa comes out from behind the red curtain as a saxophone
% plays.  She says to him in a strangely-distorted voice, "Chief Wiggum:
% don't eat the clues."  Wiggum looks at the donut in his hand, which
% has now become a burning Ace of Hearts.  Lisa holds up a burning Ace
% of Spades saying, "This suit burns better.  Look!"  Wiggum is
% befuddled.  "Better.  Look!  Burns suit."  Wiggum is still confused:
% "I'm not following you."  Dream Lisa becomes more insistent: "Burns'
% suit!  Burns' suit!"  When Wiggum _still_ doesn't get it, Lisa says in
% her normal voice, "Look at Burns' suit!  Yeesh."

Wiggum: [awakening] Oh!  Oh.
 Eddie: I had an idea, Chief: why don't we check out that suit Burns was
        wearing when he got shot?
Wiggum: Did you have that same backwards-talking dream with flaming
        cards?
 Eddie: [pause] I'll drive.
-- To protect and serve, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

% Wiggum looks over the suit with a magnifying glass and finds an
% eyelash.  "Eureka!" he cries.  He takes it to the DNA lab.

DNA guy: Ooh, nice eyelash.  Yours?
 Wiggum: No.  We need to find out who it belonged to.  We want a DNA
         test.
DNA guy: Ooh, ooh, ee, ooh, ooh, that takes, uh, eight to ten weeks.
 Wiggum: [sighs, hands him a carton of cigarettes]
DNA guy: Did I say weeks?  'Cause I meant seconds.
          [runs over to another machine, grabs a card from it; puts it
         in a computer]
 Wiggum: What do you got, the whole town's DNA on file?
DNA guy: Y'uh huh.  If you've ever handled a penny, the government's got
         your DNA.  Why do you think they keep 'em in circulation?
-- Little-known facts, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

% "Now it's going to narrow it down to the family bloodline," the DNA
% guy explains.  The computer comes up with "Simpson".
%
% Mr. Burns finally comes to and says, "Homer Simpson!"  Eddie and Lou
% grin at one another.  "Bingo: the gunman has a name-o!"  Eddie smiles.
% A Swat team bursts into the Simpson house and starts destroying
% things.

    Lisa: Hey!  Chief Wiggum, what are you doing?  What's going on?
  Wiggum: I'm sorry, kid, we got Simpson DNA on Burns' clothing and your
          father was identified by the old man himself.
Everyone: [gasps]
    Bart: [scoffing] DNA, positive ID -- those won't hold up in any
          court.  Run, Dad!
           [Homer runs into Lou]
     Lou: Hey ho!  Look what I found under Mr. Simpson's car seat.
           [holds up a revolver with rubber gloves]
           [Eddie dusts it for prints]
   Homer: I swear, I've never seen that gun before!
   Eddie: [grabbing a glass from Homer's hand] Then why are your
          fingerprints all over it, Sir?
   Homer: Aah!
           [Wiggum opens the chamber and pulls out a bullet]
  Wiggum: This bullet matches the one we pulled out of Mr. Burns!  Homer
          Simpson, you're under arrest for attempted murder.
   Homer: [getting cuffed] D'oh!
  Wiggum: Yeah, that's what they all say.  They all say "D'oh".

%
% Wiggum leads a shackled Homer into the back of a prison van and speeds
% away from the Simpson home.  He stops at the Krusty Burger Drive Thru
% for breakfast.

Wiggum: We need two cups of coffee, and two orders of bite-sized
        breakfast pancakes.  With extra dipping sauce.
   Kid: Please pull up to the service window, please.
Wiggum: [tries] The wagon's too tall!  Oh, I don't want to have to get
        out.  Ehh, I'll just drive up on the curb.
         [does so, leans out window to grab order]
         [van starts tipping]
Wiggum: Almost got it...
   Lou: Drop the food, chief!
         [van falls over; back door opens and Homer stands up]
         [Jasper pulls up in an old car]
Jasper: [honks] Damn fools!  Drive Thru's not for a-parking.
         [floors it, then skids to halt, pushing the van out forward]
         [Homer hobbles in front of it, trying to avoid it]
   Kid: Diane?  I'm going to take my break now.
-- He saw nothing, you can't prove anything, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part

% At the hospital, Burns eats breakfast in bed.

 Nick: [opening the door] Hi, everybody!
Burns: Ho, mer-Simp son!
 Nick: OK, that was a little strange.  Um, tell me: how are you feeling
       today?
Burns: Homer.  Simpson, Homer.  D'oh...Simpson.
 Nick: Hmm.  That seems to be all you can say.  When you were in that
       coma, did you feel your brain getting damaged?
-- The new medical scientific method, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

% Marge sits at the kitchen table with Lisa.

Marge: The police have such a strong case against Homer.  Mr. Burns said
       he did it, they have Homer's DNA --
 Lisa: They have Simpson DNA!  It could have come from any of us, except
       you, since you're a Bouvier.
Marge: No!  No, no, when I took your father's name, I took everything
       that came with it -- including DNA.
 Lisa: [giving up] OK, Mom.
-- Marge, literal-minded, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

 Lisa: Anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems.
       Like those fingerprints: they could have gotten on the gun some
       other way.
        [flashback to Lisa in the car with Homer]
 Lisa: Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream
       cones?
Homer: [driving with his knees] Pfft.  Yeah, right.  You chose fruit,
       you live with fruit.
        [one scoop falls out of the cone]
       D'oh!  [reaches under seat]
        [touches Pipin' Hot Bread 8-track] No...
        [touches pineapple air freshener] No...
        [touches gun] No...
        [touches lollipop] Ew!  Why is this on the floor?
        [puts it in his pocket]
        [back to present]
 Lisa: And we don't even know whose gun that was!  Maybe somebody
       planted it there to frame Dad.
Marge: No, we can't start thinking that way about our own family
       members.  Suspicion could tear us apart.
  Abe: {That's right.  We've all got to stick together if we're going to
       have any hope of bringing that awful Homer to justice.}
-- Parental love, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

% Wiggum makes a statement about Homer's escape to a group of reporters.

  Wiggum: Here is a photo of the fugitive from our files.
           [holds up picture of Homer in "Haig in '88" T-shirt]
          And now, Waylon Smithers, uh, who's been a _real_ good sport
          about that wrongful arrest thing -- whew!  Heh -- has a, er,
          statement that he would like to make.  Waylon?
Smithers: Thank you.  As Montgomery Burns' closest friend, I am certain
          there's nothing he would want more than swift, brutal revenge
          against Homer Simpson.  Therefore I am offering a $50,000
          reward for his capture -- dead or alive.
           [everyone bustles off]
  Wiggum: Oh, wow.  Me first!  Me first!
-- Justice is blind, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

% Homer walks into Burns' hospital room.

Burns: Homer Simpson?
Homer: So, you finally learned my name, eh?
Burns: [shaking head] Homer Simpson.
Homer: [freaked out] I've got no time for your demented parlor games.
       You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you...
        [reaches to strangle Burns]
-- Tense scene in the hospital room, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

% Lisa rides her bike to the town hall parking lot.  "The scene of the
% crime...there must be something here that can clear Dad."  A pigeon
% lands nearby and points its beak in a particular direction: "Clue!
% Clue!"  Lisa says, "That's it.  Oh, Mr. Pigeon, I'd _kiss_ you if you
% weren't swimming with disease!"
%
% Lisa imagines the time just after Burns got shot in black and white.
% She remembers that his gun wasn't in his holster as he staggered
% toward the sundial.  As he collapsed, she notes that his hands pointed
% at W and S on the compass points -- or, viewed from the back, on M and
% S. She gasps: "So the DNA was right!  It must have been -- oh, Dad!"
% Lou's motorcycle speaker crackles, "Attention, all units: Homer
% Simpson has been sighted.  Proceed at once to Marvin Monroe Memorial
% Hospital."  Lou speeds off, as does Lisa -- and a whole crowd of angry
% people.  Apu cautions everyone, "Be careful when we capture him!  We
% cannot claim the reward unless we have 51% of the carcass!"
%
% Lisa arrives at the hospital first and runs in.  The angry crowd
% crushes her bike with their feet on their way in.  Lisa stops in front
% of the door to Burns' room just as police are aiming their guns at it
% and yells at them.

 Lisa: Stop!  Don't shoot my Dad.  He's innocent.  He wouldn't hurt a
       fly!
        [they open the door]
Burns: [being strangled and shaken] Ho-mer Simp-son!  Ho-mer Simp-son!
Homer: Stop telling them it was me!  I'll kill you for saying it was me.
Burns: [grunting] What is the meaning of this?  Smithers, who is this
       beast that's shaking me?
Homer: [loses it] D'ohhh!  [grabs a gun, cocks it as Burns' head]
       Say it, Burns: say I never shot you!  Before.
Burns: [jovial] Shot?  [chuckles] By you?  I'm afraid not, my primitive
       friend.  Your kind has neither the cranial capacity nor the
       opposable digits to operate a firearm.  The one who shot me was
       --
        [looks around, sees his assailant]
       Aah!  Aah!  Aah!  M-Maggie Simpson!
-- The truth revealed, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

% Burns goes on to explain over a flashback, "With the sun-blocker in
% place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world.  So I wanted to
% kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth."  In the flashback, Burns
% comments how he feels like celebrating.  He spies Maggie in the back
% of the Simpson car, smiling.  "Oh, it's you: what are you so happy
% about?"  She holds up a lollipop.  He gasps and says, "I see."  In the
% present, Homer removes a lollipop from his shirt pocket and Burns
% nods, "Yes..._that's_ the one."
%
% He goes on, "Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take candy
% from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in
% my own crapulence."  Burns tells Maggie in the flashback to drop the
% lollipop.  "But the old axiom was misleading: taking the candy proved
% exceedingly difficult."  Burns struggles with Maggie, "I said drop
% it!", and in doing so, his gun falls out of the holster, into her
% hands, and discharges.  In slow motion, both the gun and lollipop fall
% on the floor and under the seat.

Burns: Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid, but finding only
       slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial.
 Lisa: Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and S...
       or, from your point of view, M and S.
Burns: What?  No!  With my last ounce of strength, I sucked out my gold
       fillings and swallowed them.  Those paramedics have sticky
       fingers.
-- Not if you're a Stonecutter, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

 Marge: Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've
        recovered and that we can all get back to normal.  If Maggie
        could talk I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you.
 Burns: I'm afraid that's insufficient.  Officer: arrest the baby!
Wiggum: Hah.  Yeah, right, pops.  No jury in the world's going to
        convict a baby.  Mmm...maybe Texas.
-- Not if you have a lucky hat, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

% Marge continues, "Besides, she didn't mean it..." Maggie sucks her
% pacifier, but the noises it makes aren't sucking sounds: they're
% gunshots.
