   [TV Guide] The 12th season opener - the series' 250th episode - features
   the Who.  See the Close-up ...  {bg}

   [TV Guide Close-up] The Who appears in the 12th-season opener as the
   explosion of new telephone area codes signals a revolt in Springfield.

   The new lines certainly don't click with Homer, especially after the change
   costs him free Who concert tickets.  After noting that it's the affluent
   side of town that gets to keep the old code, Homer suggests that "we Joe
   12-packs" form a separate town.  Thus is born New Springfield, whose mayor
   - Homer - engineers a campaign of disruption against the snobs of Olde
   Springfield.  But when his efforts backfire, Homer turns to Roger Daltrey,
   Pete Townshend, John Entwistle and Zak Starkey for help.  {bf}

Couch:          Tonight, a return to the classics:  Bart runs in ahead of the
                family and slips a whoopee cushion under Homer's spot on the
                couch.  The rest of the Simpsons run in and sit down.  Homer
                triggers the prank cushion and is embarrassed.  Bart laughs
                uproariously.

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Wilson Banswell:  Well this was a stinker for a 250th episode.  Not that it
   was absolute trash, maybe a different episode should have been chosen.
   There were some good parts, such as when Homer turned off the power to Olde
   Springfield.  But overall most of the episode seemed very implausible and
   fake.  Not like the insane idea of the town splitting it two(that was for
   satire), but like Marge when explains to Homer the area code problem.  It
   just seemed so fake.  A good story can hide some average jokes, but an
   average story can not hide average jokes.  (C)

Stephen Burks:  The 250th episode of the Simpsons was possibly the worst since
   All Singing All Dancing.  What started as a war over additional area codes
   in Springfield led to a class warfare that eventually led to a gratuitous
   placement of yet another special guest (The Who).  While the first act did
   have decent dialogue, by the end of the episode I had already forgotten
   what I was watching.  This has been going on since last season, so maybe I
   am just developing ADD.  While I did laugh out loud at least a few times, I
   really do not think it is worth the removal of any plot from the show.
   (C-)

Ben Collins:  I knew The Simpsons was going downhill when it started recycling
   plots.  Now I know Our Favorite Family has passed the point of no return.
   "A Tale of Two Springfields" is a lame Jerkass Homer episode which owes its
   soul to another lame Jerkass Homer episode, "Trash of the Titans" (which
   deserves the Nobel Prize for Literature compared to this episode).
   "Springfields" starts with an absurd premise that can barely carry a single
   gag, much less an entire episode, then throws in a barrage of dull,
   tiresome gags and yet another tacked-on, unfinished "ending."  The Who's
   useless guest shot is a typical desperate Sweeps gimmick; Mike Scully
   could've saved the money and used Wilson Phillips.  For the past few season
   premieres, I've kept the faith, hoping that this once-great series will
   reverse its long and painful decline.  Then I get on my knees and pray I
   won't get fooled again.  (F)

Nathan DeHoff:  I didn't mind the ridiculous premise here so much as I minded
   the wasted opportunities.  I think they could have done more with a split
   town than they did.  I liked the Boston Tea Party and Berlin Wall parodies,
   and I think the episode could have been funnier if the writers had stuck
   with such parodies, and developed the plot more logically, rather than just
   bringing in guest stars at the end to make everything all better.  [...]
   Overall, I'd say this one was typical of recent episodes: a wacky premise
   leading to a disjointed plot, and not enough jokes (with those that were
   there often drawn out to the point where they were no longer funny).  It
   wasn't as bad in these respects as some recent episodes I could name, but
   it wasn't especially great, either.  (C)

Don Del Grande:  The only thing that stands in the way of this being the
   "worst episode ever" is the 200 or so episodes that this one was better
   than.  Maybe they went overboard with the "wrong area code" thing,
   especially in the ending.  (A-)

Ahmet Deligonul:  It's season 11 all over again!  The 1st act started out
   nice, but when Homer decided to split Springfield in two, it got a little
   boring.  Finally when Homer decides he can't mayor a city and has to get
   The Who to play, the episode completely sucked.  A lot of it didn't make
   much sense at all.  How did the kids go to school?  Lots of unanswered
   questions.  (D)

Ben Fonter:  Hey, not too shabby!  The first act of the new season got off to
   a wonderful start.  The doghouse jokes were wonderful, especially Homer
   getting the crap beat out of him by a badger.  Act II lost little of what
   Act I had.  The splitting of the town worked wonderfully, and the feuding
   was funny.  Pimp Master Brockman and his Golden Showers was hilarious.  But
   the Who dragged down the third act a bit, even though Homer chloroforming
   Marge was funny.  The ending kinda sucked with the badgers.  But overall,
   many funny quotes and good jokes.  (B-)

Joe Green:  I was somewhat disappointed about this being yet another "Wacky
   Homer meets a celebrity" episode, but it did have some highly funny moments
   (i.e. the bullies doing Bart's homework and Kent Brockman's comment about
   "golden showers").  All in all, it's an average episode for the past few
   seasons ... not brilliant, but not horrible either.  (B-)

Carl Johnson:  The story was better than average for season eleven, much in
   the way that a stink beetle in a mass of cockroaches is better than
   average.  Pretty grim.  I didn't much like this one.  Worst season premiere
   ever.  Yucko.  I give this one a  (D)

Darrel Jones:  This 12th season premiere/250th episode was lamer than
   advertised.  The chalkboard gag was freakin' brilliant; it doesn't take a
   reAL GOREat Democratic supporter to find it funny.  Acts One and Two were
   fun as well, but as soon as the Who came in, the whole episode seemed to
   collapse. Surely they could have done more and better things with the
   British supergroup; I'm especially bothered they didn't play "Join
   Together" during the concert.  Still, I give it a 7/10  (B+)

Adam Long:  Not great, but a little better than I expected.  Luckily, The
   Who's appearance wasn't the focal point of the episode, as the commercials
   made it out to be. The problem with this episode, I thought, was wasted
   potential.  Having the town separated with the addition of an area code was
   a more creative and interesting story than the writers have been able to
   muster in the past couple seasons, and while there were some worthy,
   creative gags (I actually got a kick out of Homer's repeated failure to use
   the phone), most of the episode was the typical Scully-era
   over-exaggeration of the situation.  [...] In summary it was just another
   over-the-top wacky episode with a tacked-on guest appearance.  But since it
   was the hyped Season Premiere and 250th episode, I guess that's
   understandable.  I just hope the season picks up.  (C-)

Michael Nusair:  I enjoyed this episode.  Quite a lot, actually.  After a
   not-so-promising start (though I did like the Woody Woodpecker part), this
   turned out to be a pretty good episode.  It had a good share of laughs
   (Woody Woodpecker, the gold prospector ("eureka!"), Marge getting
   chloroformed ...).  Plus, the guest star didn't feel *too* shoe-horned in,
   as opposed to some from last season (Kid Rock, Britney Spears). Overall, a
   pleasant surprise, and a good way to start the new season.  (B+)

John Plasket:  My phone company recently added a ten-digit dialing policy,
   meaning that in order to call ANY number, an area code is required.  When
   it began, I kept forgetting, and I kept getting the tri-tone.  Therefore, I
   thought Homer's misadventures were hilarious.  This episode was funny.
   Okay, so it had a stupid plot ("Homer does <<BLANK>> ... with WACKY
   RESULTS!"), but it made me laugh.  (A-)

Mike Reed:  Ouch.  When a Halloween episode is less wacky than the season
   premiere, something's wrong.  The only funny parts came at Bart's corn can,
   and the area code film.  The rest was utter garbage.  Homer having his
   insides torn out was the worst "Joke" I've ever seen on the Simpsons, or,
   come to think of it, anywhere else for that matter.  From there, the
   episode went nowhere, with little to no redeeming humor.  This is not the
   same John Swartzwelder who wrote 7G11, 9F03, and 7F01. This is the work of
   someone who doesn't know crap about The Simpsons.  I'm normally not the
   person who says this every week, but this was seriously the worst episode
   ever.  (F)

Robin Steinmann:  After a really annoying start with an appalling open
   abdomen, the episode improved to a sensible extent.  There were only very
   few truly remarkable moment, the best being the phone informational, but
   all in all the team managed to produce a coherent story with a real ending.
   That's a change to many S11 episode.  It was not something to be overly
   proud, but at least it was a solid base from which improvement is possible.
   We'll see.  (B-)

Robert Todd:  Well ... I expected worse.  The first 5 minutes seemed to
   confirm this with both Homer (and Bart) appearing even more visibly stupid
   than in S11.  But the second act, with the war between Old and New
   Springfield, was pretty good by the Scully-era standard.  There have been
   worse guest appearances than that of The Who, most notably that of U2 in
   the 200th episode.  (C+)

Hari Wierny:  A fresh episode, probably the best I've seen in some time now.
   While there were gags which would have been better left out (such as
   Homer's disgusting wound under his shirt and continually being subject to
   physical pain), there we some funny gags too.  The main thing which made
   this episode a nice change to most recent outings is that it chose a plot
   and stuck to it.  The Who were pretty good, but did anyone else notice they
   tried to sound American in some parts?  (B)

Yours Truly:  Whether by intention or accident, show No. 250 bears a
   resemblance to "Trash of the Titans (5F09)," the 200th episode.  By my
   standards, "A Tale of Two Springfields" is an improvement.  Homer, despite
   some over-aggressive moments, is more likeable, plus he has an arguably
   legitimate cause.  Guest stars The Who do a pretty good job.  The opening
   sequence is good, too, even if it exists mainly as a platform to perform
   one of John Swartzwelder's loopy segues.  (I also liked how the final scene
   referenced it.)  Tonight's episode is satisfying in an eccentric way.
   Perhaps it is the producers' plan to loosely remake past under-performing
   episodes until they get them right.  If so, "A Tale of Two Springfields" is
   a step in the right direction.  (B)

AVERAGE GRADE:  C+ (2.20)   Std Dev.: 1.0546   (22 reviews computed)

Darrel Jones writes:  The various Who songs mentioned or played during this
   episode are: "My Generation", "Won't Get Fooled Again", "Squeeze Box" -
   Mentioned by Homer in the hotel.  "Won't Get Fooled Again" was played
   later, as the group "broke" the wall.

   "The Seeker" - Played at the start of the concert.

   "Magic Bus", "Pinball Wizard" - Requested by Homer.  The former, along with
   "Boris the Spider", is one of the two all-time most requested songs at Who
   concerts.


Speaking of Who songs, Stephen Gutknecht writes:  Another The Who fan joke is
   when homer is at the hotel trying to get the band to perform in New
   Springfield.  Homer says: "What happened to the angry, defiant Who of _My
   Generation_, _Won't Get Fooled Again_, and _Mama's Got a Squeeze Box_?".

   If you are a True(tm) fan of The Who, you would know that that _Mama's Got
   a Squeeze Box_ is not angry and defiant.  It is a playful song about sex :)


>> Those endless threads

 - Where is Springfield?

Dave Sibley:  The 636 area code is in Western Missouri.  [Cody Smith says this
   area contains Springfield, Missouri -- Ed.]


Someone named "Yomazaho" adds:  Out of curiosity I had to look up the two area
   codes.  Turns out 636 is listed for:  Ballwin, Chesterfield, Crystal City,
   De Soto, Fenton, Festus, Foley, Herculaneum, High Hill, Hillsboro,
   Holstein, Imperial, Jonesburg, Manchester, Maxville, O'Fallon, Portage des
   Sioux, St. Charles, Troy, Truxton, Union, Valley Park, Warrenton,
   Washington, West Alton, Winfield; Missouri

   That's rather funny since there is a Springfield in Missouri but when I
   search for the area code of Springfield in Missouri it turned up:
   Springfield, MO, USA -- 417.

   Also, 939 is listed as:  [ Geographic Relief Code - This code has been
   "reserved" for future relief of existing codes that will be exhausting at
   least once in the next 20 years. ]

   All looks taken from <http://decoder.americom.com/>.


Ted Mill:  One article says 939 has been assigned as an additional area code
   for Puerto Rico. So we know where Springfield is: right on the
   Missouri/Puerto Rico border.


>> President Subliminal (or is that "Subliminable?")

Benjamin Robinson:  Bart's blackboard gag, where the name "AL GORE" is
   interpolated into the message, references a tempest-in-a-teapot scandal
   that took place in the 2000 United States Presidential race.  One of
   Republican candidate George Bush's ads had key phrases (like "Vote for
   Bush") floating across the screen, in plain sight.  To grab the viewer's
   attention, parts of the "main" phrase might also float in the background in
   different positions, different sizes (so all you'd see is "OTE FO", for
   instance), and so on.

   Sounds pretty mundane, but in an ad that claimed Democrat Al Gore supported
   Washington bureaucrats, the last four letters, "RATS," floated across the
   screen.  This was interpreted as being an attempt at subliminally
   influencing the voters.  There's no evidence to show that subliminal
   anything is even remotely effective.  Even if there was, the "RATS" wasn't
   that hard to notice, and therefore not subliminal.  Of course, there's no
   denying that even the *non- subliminal* message of the ad was, "Don't vote
   for Gore" -- that's the whole point of a political ad -- so it's not like
   an anti-Gore sentiment should ring alarms.  Despite all this, it was
   evidently a slow news week because all the reporters covering the election
   jumped on the story, giving it front-page coverage even after most people
   had forgotten about it.  (Assuming they even paid attention in the first
   place.)  The Bush camp withdrew the ad, saying it was all a ghastly
   mistake.


>> But no mention of canned corn

Nate Case:  Well, I'm sure many of you noticed this, but FOX registered
   whatbadgerseat.com to match the content of tonight's episode.
   <http://www.whatbadgerseat.com>


In case the site has disappeared by the time you read it, Ryan Mead explains
   what it was like:  Fox intelligently decided to register the domain name
   www.whatbadgerseat.com. It links you to a parody site which is part of
   thesimpsons.com, which "informs" you what badgers eat, what they don't, and
   a Flash game which "tests your knowledge" by feeding things to a badger.


>> Wrong Number

Speaking of area codes, Jeff Cross has this to say:  With everybody and their
   cat getting cell-phones and pagers, the phone companies are fast running
   out of available numbers in each area code.  I can sympathize with Homer's
   outrage because I've lived through three area code gerrymanderings myself
   in Massachusetts: first there was 413 and 617.  Then in the early 1990s
   they carved 508 out of 617. Then in 1998 they further sliced those up,
   creating 978 out of 508, and 781 out of 617.  (Please not that 413 has
   never been touched during all this.)  To top it off, they're now going to
   add "overlay" codes: they're stacking a second area code on top of the
   current ones, less 413.  I was already fried about the creation of 508,
   since my home was in a border town, requiring me to call a whole new area
   code just for the next town over.  What I don't get is why Springfield
   didn't get a second phone exchange instead of a second area code.


>> Who's Who in Springfield

Robert Vandergraaf lists the residents of Old Springfield (area code 636):
   Bill and Marty (KBBL radio show), Mrs. Hoover, Sideshow Mel, Mr. Burns,
   Skinner, Mrs. Krabappel, Prof. Frink, Mr. Largo (music teacher), Apu and
   wife, Chief Wiggum, Mayor Quimby, Jimbo, Kearny, Dolph, and Kent Brockman.


And for New Springfield: Captain McAllister, Patty and Selma, the Simpsons,
   Disco Stu (?), Groundskeeper Willie, Fat Tony, Eddie and Lou (the cops),
   Lenny, Carl, Barney, Otto, Dr. Nick Rivera, Flanders, Mr. Van Houten
   (Milhouse's Dad), Moe, Bee Guy(?), Jasper, Hans, and Comic Book Guy.


>> Who did that voice again?

Matt McGrath writes:  My friend Matt Satterfield recently mentioned that
   Pete's younger brother Paul actually read Pete's lines for this episode.  I
   found this quote on VH1's artist info page for The Who.

   "The band will make a cameo appearance on the 250Th episode of the still-
   occasionally-funny Fox cartoon series. However, Townshend didn't do his own
   vocal chores on the episode, entitled A Tale of Two Springfields. Instead,
   his brother Paul Townshend reads his lines."

   [Well!  I Certainly won't get fooled again by that! -- Ed.]


Speaking of revolving band members, Jennifer Abraham writes:  If you look at
   the few times that they show the drummer, you'll see that it is actually
   supposed to represent their first drummer, Keith Moon, not Zak Starkey,
   their current drummer. This is most likely part of the reason they credited
   the voices to just "The Who", and not the individual voices, as they did
   not want to start any controversies. (That, and because Pete wouldn't lend
   his voice to the eppie, but most people that aren't die-hard Who fans don't
   know the difference, so instead of confusing the people by putting [Paul]
   Townshend in the credits, they just used "The Who." Or so I was told by Mr.
   Townshend when I corresponded with him.)


>> She'll sleep with anyone!

Benjamin Robinson tells us:  Joan Collins is an actress who has played a
   variety of trashy roles in equally trashy movies.  She's also pretty well
   known as Alexis on the 80's prime-time soap, "Dynasty."  Most of her roles
   involved playing women of, ahem, questionable moral standards, but I don't
   know if she is that way in real life.


>> Next door to Olde eBay Park

Dave Sibley writes:  I personally enjoyed the Yahoo search engine joke arena
   joke.  It's a nice way of poking fun at the fact that just about every
   sporting arena is now sponsored by some large corporation and the recent ad
   campaigns by .com companies.  Especially since I live near the Conseco
   Fieldhouse and the RCA Dome.


>> Oh, so that's what they were laughing at

Dave Sibley explains:  Saying you're taking a "golden shower" is a less vulgar
   way of saying you are being urinated on.


Stephen Burks adds:  Urination by one party onto another, usually for sexual
   purposes (note: This is the second major sexual reference in the past two
   episodes, the other being "glory hole")


>> "Otherwise known as Sun City ..."

Benjamin Trollip:  Famous for its casino, private game reserve (with "over 300
   Nile Crocodiles "), Palace of the Lost City Hotel and annual Million Dollar
   Challenge Golf Tournament, Sun City is probably one of the biggest tourist
   attractions in South Africa.  As the 'city's' Web page says, "Sun City is a
   world unto its self and has earned its reputation as Africa's Kingdom of
   Pleasure."  I guess Homer felt Olde Springfield had a Sun City flavour to
   it ...


There may have been more to it than that, as Benjamin Robinson explains:  When
   rock stars of the 80's weren't fighting against world hunger (in Live Aid)
   or farm foreclosures (Farm Aid), they were protesting apartheid, South
   Africa's legalized racism.  The musicians couldn't single-handedly force
   the South African government to do their bidding, but they could -- and
   many did -- boycott playing in the country or working with their musicians.
   [They were pretty strict about it, too.  Paul Simon took some heat for
   crossing the "picket line" and recording with black South African
   musicians, even though black people were whom the rock community was trying
   to help.]

   Raising the issue in the public consciousness was another important step in
   bringing down apartheid.  There was a resort called Sun City in South
   Africa; one of the guys in Bruce Springsteen's band recorded a protest song
   called "(I Ain't Gonna Play) Sun City."  It was a hit -- kind of hard to
   say "no" to something with such good intentions -- and people got the
   message even if they never heard of Sun City before.

   Incidentally, South Africa finally dumped their apartheid policy, so even
   if Homer had fooled The Who into thinking Olde Springfield was Sun City,
   they could have played there without regrets.


>> Take that ... Snuh-field?

Benjamin Robinson:  No, sorry, you didn't hear that.  According to the closed
   captions, Homer said, "Take that, Old Snub-field!"  This makes rather more
   sense, since Homer felt snubbed by his old town.  Maybe next time, "snuh"
   fans.

   [Posting messages that simply said, "snuh" was a fad on alt.tv.simpsons a
   while back -- Ed.]


>> It's got a nice beat and it's easy to dance to it

Dave Sibley tells us:  "Pac-Man Fever" was by Buckner and Garcia.  It was a
   moderate hit that cashed in on the "Pac-Man Fever" that was spreading
   across America in the early 1980's.  Buckner and Garcia also released an
   album, called "Pac-Man Fever," full of video game-inspired songs such as
   "Do the Donkey Kong."  The b-side to "Pac-Man Fever" was, depending on the
   version, either an instrumental version of "Pac-Man Fever" or "Do the
   Donkey Kong."


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Kon Stamadianos alterna-title for this show is:  Homer Hears The Who


Joe Green suggests:  Area Code of Honor


According to a Fox press release (via Bill LaRue), this episode received a
   Nielsen rating of 9.2, with a share of 14.  (The rating is an absolute
   number of people who watched the show.  A "share" is the percentage of TV
   sets in use at the time.)


Greg Doyle:  Zak Starkey [is] Ringo's son, and the usual tour drummer for The
   Who.


Joe Green:  Fox's print ads showed Homer and the Who sleeping under a British-
   flag blanket, a likely reference to the Who's "The Kids are Alright" album.


Hari Wierny:  I believe this is the first episode to be aired in the UK only a
   week after it's premiere in the States.

Marge:	Like the one in Berlin?
Homer:	Good idea.  We should call the guys they used.  [picks up 
	the phone and dials, getting the tri-tone, again]
Marge:	Homer ...
Homer:	[insistently] It's ringing.
-- "A Tale of Two Springfields"

% The wall is built, and at the dedication ceremony, Homer praises Fat 
% Tony's Low-Ball Construction Company for building it from 90% 
% recycled materials.  Homer thanks the people for staying in New 
% Springfield, despite their inadequate infrastructure.  Carl points 
% out that, with the roads blocked, there's now way to get food into 
% the town.  Homer can't give a reassuring answer, and the town goes 
% over the wall.  Soon, only his immediate family and the tumbleweeds 
% are left -- and after a gust of wind, the tumbleweeds are gone, too.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:27]
%
% Homer now has the dubious honor of being mayor of a ghost town.  He 
% walks down the street with his family, grousing about the towns-
% people's lack of loyalty.  As he passes by stores with interesting 
% merchandise, he smashes the window and helps himself.

Homer:	Anyhow, those rats will come crawling back -- we've got 
	The Who playing here tonight!
Lisa:	Dad, the arena's in Old Springfield.
Homer:	D'oh!
Bart:	Don't give up, Dad!  Maybe we can get The Who to play here 
	instead.
Homer:	Hey, maybe we could.  But we'll need some liquid 
	persuasion.
	[cut to a store selling chloroform.  Homer smashes the 
	window and grabs a bottle]
	C'mon Bart, we're going to bring back The Who!
	[kisses the chloroform bottle, then immediately passes 
	out]
-- "A Tale of Two Springfields"

% Bart revives his father, and they both sneak into Hotel Pillowmint, 
% where the former Hillbilly Bugger Boys are staying.  Almost as soon 
% as they step off the elevator, they are confronted by the band's 
% bodyguard, who is so huge he appears to take up most of the hallway.

Guard:	Can I help you?
Homer:	Uh ...
Bart:	Dad, the chloroform.
Homer:	Huh?  Oh, right.  [holds up the bottle] I'll give you this 
	bottle of chloroform if you'll take us to The Who.
Bart:	D'oh!  [slaps forehead]
Guard:	So you want to see The Who, huh?  Well, I'll take you to 
	The Who.  [takes them to a doorway] Here's your Who!
	[throws Bart and Homer through the door.  The camera 
	switches positions to show that they have landed right at 
	The Who's feet]
Roger:	I thought we fired that guard.
Guard:	Oh, yeah, right; I got fired by The Who.  Whatever you 
	say, pal.  [does the "crazy" whistle] Wacko.  [twirls his 
	finger in the "nuts" gesture, and leaves]
-- Good help is hard to find, "A Tale of Two Springfields"

% Homer is in awe.  He and Bart start smashing up the hotel room in 
% the grand rock-star tradition.  The band asks them to stop -- they 
% don't want to lose their pool privileges at the hotel.

Homer:	Whatever.  The point is, I'm Homer Simpson.
John:	The mayor of New Springfield?
Homer:	That's right.
Roger:	The crazy mayor of New Springfield?
Homer:	That's right, and I implore you to move your concert to 
	our town.  Don't play Old Springfield ... or, as it is 
	sometimes known, Sun City.
Roger:	We had a handshake agreement with a concert promoter, and 
	that's a sacred bond.
Who:	[reverently] Sacred Bond.
Homer:	Come on, what happened to the angry, defiant Who of, "My 
	Generation," "Won't Get Fooled Again," and "Mama's Got a 
	Squeeze Box?"
John:	We know our songs, Homer.
Homer:	But those Old Springfield squares are just going to make 
	you cut your hair, turn down your music, and wear frilly 
	shirts like Keith Partridge.
Roger:	Keith Partridge?  Who huddle.
	[the band huddles to talk things over]
John:	We'll do it!
Bart:	Yeah!  [Homer and Bart exchange high-fives]
John:	Just send the car for us.
Homer:	What, something wrong with your legs?
Roger:	You're right.  The walk will do us good.
-- "A Tale of Two Springfields"

% Meanwhile, at the Old Springfield arena, the crowd gathers.  Krusty 
% reminisces.

Krusty:	I opened for The Who at Woodstock.  I came out in a Beatle 
	wig with a ukulele.  Hendrix said he almost plotzed -- his 
	exact words.
Mel:	[sarcastic] Oh, I never tire of that story.
-- "A Tale of Two Springfields"

% Elsewhere, in the arena, Burns berates Smithers for creasing his 
% jeans, but it turns out the crease is in his leg itself.  As the 
% appointed time for the concert to begin comes and goes, the crowd 
% grows rowdy.  Suddenly, a few bars of "The Seeker" can be heard from 
% somewhere in the distance.  The concert-goers quickly realize what 
% has happened.  The Who are playing New Springfield.

Homer stole our rock performance!  That fat, dumb, and bald guy sure 
plays some real hardball.
-- Moe, "A Tale of Two Springfields"

% The crowd storms out of the arena.
%
% The Who, who are playing on top of Homer's wall, finish up the song.  
% Pete wonders why they're playing to a crowd of just five people, but 
% Homer assures them more people will be coming.  Meanwhile, he has a 
% few suggestions.

Homer:	Now, these are the tunes I want you boys to play.
Roger:	Wait a minute.  Homer, a lot of these are Grand Funk 
	Railroad songs.
John:	We don't know "Pac-Man Fever."
Homer:	Oh come on, it plays itself.  [grabs Pete's guitar, and 
	strums randomly] Ah, Pac-Man fever, ah, doo-doo-doo-doo, 
	it'sa drivin' me cra-a-a-a-zy!  Look, Lisa!  Daddy's in 
	The Who.
-- Who Are You?  "A Tale of Two Springfields"

% Homer makes an impromptu wig from a discarded mop, and plays for a 
% bit more, but is hit by a bottle.

Quimby:	Give us back our concert, Simpson.
Homer:	So, New Springfield's looking pretty good now, isn't it, 
	with our ample parking, and daily Who concerts.
Roger:	Daily?
Homer:	[aside to Roger] We'll talk.
-- "A Tale of Two Springfields"

% Moe yells, "Enough chit-chat.  Let's see how you like flaming 
% garbage."  This isn't the name of a new band; the Old 
% Springfieldians have brought in a catapult and launch payloads of 
% flaming garbage toward the new town.  The first batch hits the 
% landmark tire fire.  As Homer taunts the mob, a second wad of 
% garbage scores a direct hit on Homer.  John throws some water on 
% him.

John:	Oh, please, what's all this fighting about?
Pete:	Apparently, they have two different area codes.
Roger:	Well, I'll be chuggered.  That's the sticky wicket?  Why 
	not just buy telephones with auto-ringup, or as you Yanks 
	call it, speed dial.
	[the crowd murmurs its approval]
	Radio Shack has some great ones.
Pete:	Humph.  Says you.
Homer:	"Magic Bus!"
Crowd:	Yeah, "Magic Bus!"
Roger:	Okay, we'll play "Magic Bus" if you tear down this wall.
Homer:	[pauses to consider] "Pinball Wizard."
-- "A Tale of Two Springfields"

% Fed up, Pete decides to do this himself.  He turns the amplifier 
% past ten to "Whuh-oh!" and the band starts playing the Nissan Maxima 
% theme song (a.k.a. "Won't Get Fooled Again").  The wall crumbles 
% under the aural assault, and the people rush through the breach to 
% start dancing.

Homer:	Well, Marge, looks like your insane experiment is over.
Marge:	My experiment?  You're the one who came up with this whole 
	idea ...
	[Homer chloroforms Marge into submission.  They dance, 
	sort of, with Homer holding up his woozy wife]
-- "A Tale of Two Springfields"

% A badger stands at the crest of a hill overlooking the town.  He 
% signals his troops to begin their attack on the town, now that 
% everyone is busy dancing.  Wave after wave of badgers descends on 
% the unsuspecting town as the band plays on.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time:  20:00]
%
% After The Who finishes "Won't Get Fooled Again," the normal credit 
% music plays.  The Gracie Sound is the "Shh!" lady trying to hush the 
% tri-tone.
