> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   (Canadian) Homer tries to discover what's in a name when he enlists hippies
   (guest voices Martin Mull and George Carlin) to uncover the reasoning
   behind his middle initial.  {hl}

   (United States) At his mother's former commune, newly dropped-out Homer
   gets both remaining members (voices of George Carlin and Martin Mull) to go
   on an "old-time freak-out"  {af}

==============================================================================
Blackboard:     NO ONE CARES WHAT MY \ DEFINITION OF "IS" IS

Couch:          The family runs in to sit on the couch, which now has a safety
                bar attached to it.  When they sit down, the bar lowers,
                locking them in place.  Then, the Simpsons take a wild ride
                around their own living room.

> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================

Brad Bizzolt:
   ... Homer keeps wiping his face with the poncho, even after he's warned
       about what's on it?
   ... Homer's got his Fondas all mixed up (Peter played the Hippie, Henry is
       dead)?

Anthony Dean:
   ... no one thought of looking up Homer's birth certificate or hospital
       records to find out what his middle initial is?

Don Del Grande:
   ... hippie Homer had curled hair?
   ... Homer tried to get hippie lessons from someone who not only supported
       the war but entertained troops there?
   ... the "hippies" were playing Hackey Sack, which became popular long after
       the 1960s?  [{pt} writes, "It was popular among the 'second generation"
       hippies at my high school.  I figure the real hippies probably picked
       it up about the same time."]
   ... Homer was wearing a "The Cat in the Hat" hat when he entered
       Springfield Elementary?
   ... Homer managed to survive skull penetration by a daisy?  (Then again,
       this is Homer's brain we're talking about)

Jordan Eisenberg:
   ... Smithers' voice was particularly grainy?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the safety bar bends Marge's hair in the couch gag?
   ... Homer doesn't think he's the oaf the hippies were talking about?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... even *more* new people have joined the staff of the show?  (Tom Martin,
       Caroyln Omine)

Brian Rawson-Ketchum:
   ... despite being a millionaire, Burns brought a sack lunch?
   ... Homer's mother was voiced by Tress MacNeille [as opposed to Glenn
       Close] in this episode?
   ... several businesses from past episodes can be seen during Homer's freak
       out?  [See "FFF" section for more]

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... despite his vast wealth, Burns apparently can't afford to buy one of
       those rubber twisty jar openers?
   ... after attempting to open the pickle jar, Homer's hair is disheveled?
   ... Homer pokes himself with the writing end of his pen?  (Lucky for him,
       it didn't leave a mark on his shirt.)

Matt Rose:
   ... "Smithee" is very close to "Smithers", despite Alan Smithee being an
       actual pseudonym?
   ... the two hippies' dog "Ginsberg" looks a lot like "Rover Hendrix"?

Paul Tomko:
   ... Seth and Munchie had an awfully large "personal" vegetable garden?
       Could they be selling weed on the side?

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Two inspired scenes (the hallucinations and the
   "freak-out"), a few pretty funny ones, and a few too many plot tangents in
   the beginning for the episode's own good.  What the hey, it made me laugh.
   I'll give it a "B." Now if you'll excuse me while I kiss the sky ...  (B)

Brad Bizzolt:  For me, The Simpsons has always been about ridiculous humour
   based on jabs at popular culture (or in this case, counterculture).  Having
   said that, I loved this episode. Normally, when Homer tries to act "hip,"
   it's painfully embarrassing (and usually intended to be that way -- ref.
   "Homerpalooza" and "ISP Show").  This time, he was just plain funny to me,
   and he did so without being overtly stupid or mean-spirited. As far as
   Homer-centric episodes, this one ranks at the top for me.  The episode was
   packed with excellent gags from the other minor characters as well, and
   thus earns it the lauded A+ grade.  I'm sure others who aren't quite as
   amused by the hippie culture (or its blatant commercialization in recent
   years) were disappointed, but they at least reached out and touched this
   one person, and isn't that what counts?  (A+)

Rich Bunnell:  The episode had some great jokes in it, like the whole "Uptown
   Girl" thing and Grampa & Jasper's Beavis & Butthead routine, but the plot
   was utterly retarded (Oh boy, Homer gets obsessed with ANOTHER stupid
   thing) and it had a fart joke in it which is another step towards South
   Park humor.  Still, by my law, I cannot hate an episode, and I honestly
   didn't -- the jokes, even within the plot were pretty funny (aside from the
   fart joke) and Grampa at Woodstock sitting on a chair in a business suit
   was utterly hilarious!  (B-)

Ben Collins:  Despite some of the problems typical of recent episodes (not
   much of a plot, gags don't pull the punch they used to), this episode is a
   fun, innocent romp through "the lighter side of hippies."  Homer isn't
   nearly as obnoxious or off-putting as he was in, say, "When You Dish Upon a
   Star," and the great George Carlin gave a very convincing performance
   (after all, he is the "Hippy Dippy Weatherman").  Not a deep or even
   memorable episode, but sweet and charming; it's nice to see some good,
   low-calorie fun once in a while.  If only they could get Glenn Close,
   though ...  (B-)

Nathan Mulac DeHoff:  This was another episode based primarily on gags, rather
   than plot. What plot we did have wandered quite a bit, with the only real
   unifying element being Homer's trying to live the life of a hippie.
   Overall, it started out fairly well, with the SNPP recruitment film and
   Homer's quest for his middle name, but did not really build up to a
   conclusion. There were some excellent scenes, however, like the freak-out
   and the hallucination bits.  The music was well-done, and the "Uptown Girl"
   running gag was quite amusing.  The relatively high laugh factor was enough
   to pull a weak plot up to a  (C+)

Anthony Dean:  Another mediocre episode.  While seeing the jar bit was funny
   ("because it's true"), along with the revelation of what Homer's middle
   initial stood for, the rest of the episode felt flat for me (especially the
   third act).  (C-)

Don Del Grande:  "Homer the Hippie" just wasn't different enough to be funny,
   and the "reefer madness" sub-plot wasn't much of a replacement.  At least
   we know what Homer's middle name is ... unless somebody else wrote the
   inscription and misunderstood "Homer J." for "Homer Jay".  (B-)

Yuri Dieujuste:  Many may disagree with me but this episode was horribly
   written.  I never laughed during the whole episode.  If this was the 5th
   season, this would have been really bad but since this was the 10th season,
   I will let this slide.  The continuity was horrible.  IMHO, the idea to
   bring in Homer's middle name was very cheap and lame.  Could this be the
   start of revealing every secret?  (D)

Jordan Eisenberg:  A lot of funny lines, and some good plot twists, but it was
   mostly "Been there. Done that."  Homer gets a crazy idea, takes it to the
   extreme, uses his quote-unquote "intellectual abilities" to change the idea
   to fit his own personality ... please, we need some original plots.
   Everyone was characterized pretty well (except Mr. Burns), but the two
   guest stars didn't really do anything for me.  The animation was its usual
   for nowadays: muddy colors and rigid gestures, with only the brief
   "trip-out" scenes giving us anything interesting to look at.  Not as good
   as I'd hoped, yet better than it could have been:  (B)

Alex Foley:  Not bad, but not great.  The episode suffered from a weak
   premise, but thankfully Homer wasn't as idiotic as he was in last week's
   episode.  The hallucination and the ending credits raise this one from a C+
   to a  (B-)

Darrel Jones:  Another Season Ten classic!  Homer as a hippie did not
   disappoint, and the hallucination scene was just CLASSIC!  And who'd have
   thought that "Homer J. Simpson" could be his full name, after all?  This is
   a great season so far!  (A)

Haynes Lee:  The episode had no real focus and meandered all over the place.
   The opening company film was a non-starter and middle initial mystery
   should have been revealed at the end, not during the first act.  (C)

Jake Lennington:  A bizarre episode that had one of the funniest third acts
   I've ever seen on The Simpsons.  The only downer was the second act and
   Homer's weird "jester/hippie" dialog.  (B)

Ondre Lombard:  Boring, average-for-recent-years schlep with Homer's wandering
   attention span being sucked into some wild, crazy and unfunny idea, and it
   annoying others.  Even Homer (murdering) Uptown Girl apparently didn't save
   this one.  I've come to the point that I don't even care about any episodes
   centered around Homer anymore.  They seem to all have something obnoxious
   in common.  (D)

Liz McAuley:  I liked this episode!  Not among the top twenty for me, but
   plenty of laughs, and plenty great sight gags (the hallucinations, Jasper &
   Abe a la Beavis and Butthead).  Being from a University & town that prides
   itself on being stuck in the 60s (well, it used to at any rate), Homer's
   conversion to hippiedom was especially hilarious.  I would've liked to see
   bigger parts for Bart & Lisa, and some more of the minor characters
   hallucinating (ya, I know -- sick, sick!) but overall a very good effort.
   (B)

Brian Rawson-Ketchum:  This episode is mediocre as far as OFF goes, the only
   overly amusing scene was the one where Burns got Homer, Lenny, and Carl to
   do his talkie.  Other than that, nothing else was that hilarious.  Still, I
   have to admit it was an interesting story, even though it wasn't as filled
   with good jokes as I expected.  Specifically, I wanted more from Skinner's
   scene (something along the lines of "No, don't listen to them, children.")
   On the other hand, I'm glad that Homer J. Simpson can now be known as
   Homer, eh, *Jay* Simpson.  (C)

Abhi Ray:  I felt that this episode was average.  The plot was nothing more
   than Homer doing something dumb, unintentionally, and messes things up when
   he tries to make up.  However, the whole setup of Homer deciding top be a
   hippie was well done, but the ending was too abrupt.  The hippie jokes were
   a mixed bag, with some insightful jokes, but also many pointless contrived
   references (the Bob Hope tape).  Some funny bits, but the plot was weak,
   and the hippie jokes soon grew tiresome.  (C+)

Matt Rose:  Well, this is acceptable I guess for a Homercentric episode.  I
   think Homer's stupidity wasn't a factor this week like it seemed like it
   was every week.  He acted for reasons and only wanted to do good, instead
   of being a totally deplorable character.  Some very good moments,
   particularly little Homey (aww, he's so cute) and all of the hallucinatory
   segments, particularly Jasper and Butt-head.  However, this episode had an
   overall zaniness to it that bothered me.  Still, I've seen two AABF's and
   both are heaps better than the two 5F's I've seen this season.  I see
   potential for better episodes than this, but they are going in the right
   direction at least - which is up.  (B)

Jason Rosenbaum:  This episode was great.  After last week's stinker, this is
   a huge surprise.  The trailers for this ep made it look like Homerpalooza
   II (in my opinion, the worst episode ever), but it was actually nothing
   like I've ever seen before. The Alan Smithee gag cracked me up (for those
   who don't know who he is, I suggest seeing the awful Burn Hollywood Burn),
   the plot was good.  The whole Homer becoming a hippie thing was really well
   done.  The ending was abrupt though.  (A)

Samuel Sklaroff:  I loved this episode.  First, Donick Cary is a great (but
   underused) writer, having written "The Last Temptation of Krust" and "In
   Marge we Trust".  The biggest laugh was the fact that Mr. Burns' commercial
   was "an Alan Smithee production", although I probably think that because I
   was stoned at the time (ha-ha).  The Beavis & Butthead parody was pretty
   funny, but it was sort of a rake scene (the kind that drags on, not the
   scene in this ep with Willie, which was really hard to watch).  The ending
   was also funny, I would never have suspected that the flower would get
   stuck in Homer's head.  My only complaint is that they could have done a
   good joke about Otto and his drug habits, but overlooked that possibility.
   Bravo!  (A-)

Yours Truly:  Well, it's better than the brown acid, but this episode never
   seems quite as funny as it could be, and ends with a few too many loose
   threads.  Guest appearances by George Carlin and Martin Mull as two aging
   hippies help lift this episode, as do an intra-coprorate movie (at the
   beginning) and some hallucination scenes (near the end).  Also noteworthy
   are the excellent psychedelic credits, and the Yo La Tengo cover of the
   "Simpsons" theme.  (B-)

>> Musical References

This episode featured several songs, but because they weren't parodied, they
   don't belong in the "References" section.  Instead, they will be listed
   here.

   "Uptown Girl," Billy Joel, 1983 -- Homer's choice in freak-out music  {jk}

   "Incense and Peppermints", Strawberry Alarm Clock, 1967  {dj}

   "Hair," 1969 -- ... also played during the freak-out {jk}  [{dj} says this
   is the Cowsills' version, recorded in 1969]

   "Time of the Season," The Zombies, 1969 -- heard while Homer makes more
   juice at night  {dj}

   "White Rabbit," Grace Slick and Jefferson Airplane, 1967 -- this song plays
   while the town hallucinates  {hl}

   [Carl Abbott writes, "While I was watching the episode, I knew that at some
   point  they would have to play 'White Rabbit'.  For whatever reason it
   seems that any show, movie or documentary on the late 60's *must* play this
   song at some point.]

   "The Star Spangled Banner" -- Jimi Hendrix plays his classic rendition
   {hl}

   [{bjr} adds, "My understanding is that his set was one of the last, or
   maybe the very last, one in the festival, which should give you some idea
   when the scene with Homer's parents took place."]

   The way Hendrix appears and is animated is very similar to the actual
   performance.  I have footage of him performing that "Excuse Me While I Kiss
   the Sky" song ["Purple Haze"] and it looks very similar to his animated
   "appearance."  {ol}

>> What's your definition of "troublemaker"?

Benjamin Robinson:  Who says today's children don't pay attention to politics?
   Bart's blackboard punishment, "Nobody cares what my definition of 'is' is,"
   clearly shows the leader of the free world really is a role model for the
   kiddies.  A few months before "D'oh-in' in the Wind" aired, President
   Clinton testified before a panel of investigators that he did not commit
   perjury when he claimed, under oath, that he did not have sexual relations
   with intern Monica Lewinsky.  The problem was, Clinton =did= have sex with
   Lewinsky.  In an attempt at semantic hair-splitting that would impress even
   Bart, Clinton tried to define his words and terms in a ridiculously narrow
   fashion.  At one point, Clinton literally asked what his questioner's
   definition of "is" was.  That's right, the word "is."  That didn't go over
   better with the investigators than with Mrs. Krabappel, but (so far)
   Clinton hasn't had to repeatedly write anything on the chalkboard.


>> Cavalcade of stars

Haynes Lee discusses celebrities who appeared or were mentioned:  (From SNPP
   capsule [2F12]) GEORGE CARLIN was involved in a lawsuit that went to the
   U.S. Supreme Court in the 1970s.  The court upheld the FCC's ban on seven
   words which may not be broadcast.  The seven words were the centerpiece of
   a hilarious monologue by Carlin.

   (From SNPP capsule [3F16]) ALEX ROCCO "is your regular grumpy old man next
   door type of actor. He did `The George Carlin Show', for which Sam Simon
   produced. Rocco also voiced Roger Myers in `Itchy & Scratchy & Marge'."

   MARTIN MULL first appeared in the 1976 demented TV satire serial "Mary
   Hartman, Mary Hartman".  He later went on to the satiric talk show parody
   Fernwood 2-Night and then America 2-Night, whose wackiness was surpassed
   only by the real life David Letterman in 1980.

   BOB HOPE: Has not changed his material since the 50s.

   PHYLLIS DILLER: Frequent guest star of Bob Hope specials and constantly
   makes jokes on how ugly she looks.

   JILL ST. JOHN: Best known as a Bond babe in "Diamonds are Forever".

   PETER FONDA: Will always be remembered for Captain America in Easy Rider.
   He is still alive.

   BARBARA STREISAND: Her latest movie "Mirror Has Two Faces" which she has
   produced, directed and starred in got lukewarm reviews at the box office.


Darrel Jones mentions someone Haynes Lee didn't:  Dean Rusk was US Secretary
   of State 1961-69, during the years Kennedy and Johnson were president.


>> But can he direct as well as Pound Foolish?

Charles Thompson:  Alan Smithee is a name that directors and crew of bad
   movies often tack onto a film when they're too ashamed to use their real
   name.

   In fact, there is a really bad movie called "An Alan Smithee Film Burn
   Hollywood Burn" (just like that, with no punctuation) about an Alan Smithee
   film director named Alan Smithee who has made a bad movie.  Interestingly
   enough, this film about a bad movie ended up so incredibly horrible the
   real director took his name off the credits.  So "An Allan Smithee Film
   ...." really was directed by Alan Smithee.


Ben Collins adds:  The director was Arthur Hiller ("Love Story"), and the
   writer was none other than Joe "Showgirls" Eszterhas, both bad-movie
   veterans.  I have a conspiracy theory about that movie, although I'll admit
   I haven't seen it: perhaps these two, formerly well-regarded artists
   notorious for their recent memorable flops, conspired to make a super-bad
   movie as an "Up Yours" to the rest of Hollywood.  [Michael Byron Baer
   provides another reason, saying "Hiller removed his name from the credits
   after the film's production company, Cinergi Pictures, preferred the cut
   made by producer/writer Joe Eszterhas over Hiller's cut."]


Finally, Michael Byron Baer observes:  "Alan Smithee" is an anagram for "The
   alias men."


>> At least his parents didn't call him Homer Simpson II.na The notion of incorporating your middle initial in your everyday name (like, "David X. Cohen") goes back a ways, according to Haynes Lee

>> "You forgot a goof"

Eh, no we didn't.  Anthony Dean points out the possible error:  This episode
   seems to keep with [3F06]'s portrayal of Homer as a young boy in 1969,
   despite [9F03] presenting Homer as a teenager (and with Woodstock occurring
   within weeks of the moon landing, no less ...), as well as Homer's 1974
   high school graduation date in [7F12].


... And Benjamin Dreyfus explains why this isn't really a goof:  Since the
   Simpsons characters do not age in the present, their past has to move along
   with them.  Thus, if Homer is 35, then in 1991 his birthdate was 1956
   (making him 18 in 1974), but now his birthdate is 1963 (making him 6 in
   1969).


>> Three Days of Peace and Music

Joe Klemm:  In 1969, in New York, the Woodstock concert took place.  On the
   weekend of the concert, many hippies attended this event featuring some of
   the best rock and roll acts of the late '60's.  It proved to be a success,
   with the concert inspiring a Oscar winning documentary, the name of a
   Peanuts character, and a follow-up concert event in 1994.


>> Bowser for President

Dan Gonigal:  And in case anyone here doesn't know, (hey, we got some
   young'ins among us),Sha Na Na were a novelty 50's nostalgia group, and
   believe it or not, they actually were at Woodstock and even made it into
   the film of the concert.


Benjamin Robinson:  They even remained active after Woodstock, and popular
   enough to have their own syndicated TV show (although I didn't watch it
   that closely).  Also, they were the band playing at the big dance in
   "Grease," no?


>> The freak-out car for the modern hippie

Another Benjamin Robinson Car Watch (tm) item:  Seth and Munchie drive a late-
   model Saturn.  Ordinarily, that wouldn't be interesting, but Saturn has an
   interesting ad campaign.  Instead of emphasizing the car itself, many of
   the commercials focus on how nice the people who build and sell the cars
   are.  This grass-roots look at mass automobile production probably
   resonates with people like Seth and Munchie, former hippies who have
   largely entered mainstream society.


>> The secret ingredient is ... peyote

Jake George:  Peyote is a type of Cactus (Lophophora williamsii) that contains
   the hallucinogen Mescaline.  For one, true Peyote is hard to come by as it
   is almost extinct ... though other forms of mescaline are available (San
   Pedro for example).  That's all frivolous detail but ... why would Homer
   think of putting a cactus in a juice?  It almost seemed as if the plants in
   the background (when the camera pans to the "secret garden") were marijuana
   plant looking ... not cacti (I can't remember for sure though).  Though,
   the idea of peyote being used is still quite hilarious!


Dave Sibley adds:  [Peyote] causes much of what the episode showed us:
   fantastic colors, hallucinations, etc.  It is actually legal to use in the
   US supposing you are the member of the right religion which I believe is
   The Native American Church of Navajoland.  Of course, I doubt that many of
   America's hippies, including Seth and Munchie, were using Peyote for purely
   religious purposes.


>> Maybe Garden Blast is sponsoring Pink Floyd's next tour ...

Under the influence of the supercharged juice, Ned Flanders hallucinates,
   among other things, a set of walking hammers.  The sight prompted Benjamin
   Robinson to ask:  Uh, guys?  Weren't the hammers first shown on album art
   for "The Wall"?  That album's from 19_7_9.


Dale G. Abersold answers:  Plus the animation of the hammers comes from the
   Gerald Scarfe animation in the movie version which came out in the early
   1980's ...


Dan Gonigal responds:  ... Which is all beside the point, though.  The Wall,
   and the Marching hammers, deal with themes of hatred, isolation,
   materialistic excess and eventual insanity.  They have absolutely nothing
   to do with the 60's chronologically or thematically.


>> Now here are some of your no-name bands ...

Yo La Tengo fan Brad Bizzolt tells us about the band behind the show's closing
   music:  If ever there was a band that defined the phrase "critic's
   darlings," it would have to be Yo La Tengo.  The band, a three-piece from
   Hoboken NJ, have been playing their unique strain of rock for close to 15
   years now, garnering a somewhat large cult following in the underground
   and, more recently, attention from the commercial music industry as well (I
   guess a spot on a national television show would solidify that, huh?).  The
   band's sound is an enigmatic mixture of the Beach Boys and the Velvet
   Underground, with more recent releases harnessing the chaotic noise energy
   of Sonic Youth.  I don't know that I ever viewed them as a "psychedelic"
   band before, but I think their rendition of the theme fit the mood quite
   nicely.

   I'm not sure of the specifics (someone here must know), but the band's name
   comes from a book about Hispanic baseball players coming up into the
   majors.  "Yo La Tengo", in somewhat rough Spanish, translates to "I've got
   it," i.e. what a fielder would shout when calling a fly ball.

   For all those interested in checking out their music, I might recommend
   picking up their album "Painful" (1993), or their most recent (1997)
   release "I Can Hear The Heart Beating As One."  Their energetic and often
   humorous live show is not to be missed either.  For the record, the band is

   Ira Kaplan - guitar
   James McNew - bass
   Georgia Hubley - drums

   On the records, all three share vocal duties, although husband & wife duo
   Ira & Georgia sing on the bulk of the songs.


Someone named "pashko2":  I think that "Yo la tengo" is from an early NY Mets
   team.  They had Richie Ashburn in centerfield and a Spanish Speaking
   infielder.  Ashburn would yell " I've got it" and the infielder wouldn't
   understand him and they would collide, so they told Ashburn to say "Yo la
   tengo".  He yells this the next chance he has and gets run over by another
   outfielder who doesn't understand Spanish.  [Bob Wells confirmed this is
   correct, and noted the men were: "Richie Ashburn, center field; Elio
   Chacon, shortstop; Frank Thomas, left field."]


Finally, Brad Bizzolt offers this trivia tidbit:  Apparently, Georgia Hubley,
   YLT's drummer, has some ties with the animation business; her father worked
   for UPA Animators, the company that created Mr. Magoo.  He also worked on
   the old children's program "The Electric Company" and even had Georgia do
   some voices for the show if they needed a young child's voice for a part.
   Mr. Hubley originally worked for Disney, but left during a company-wide
   strike (for fear of being blacklisted) and joined UPA which had just
   formed.

   I wouldn't suggest that this is -why- the band got a spotlight on the show
   -- it's obviously just a case of a writer/staff member being a big fan --
   but it's interesting to see how things tie in together this way.


>> "Turn me on, dead man"

Benjamin Robinson:  One of the flakier rumors of the late Sixties was that
   Paul McCartney of Beatles fame was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1966,
   and then secretly replaced by a double.  (I'm sure that sounds much more
   plausible after a few swigs of Seth & Munchie's Garden Blast.)  Anyway, the
   surviving members were supposedly leaving a trail of subtle clues to the
   truth in the album art, the liner notes, and even the music itself.
   According to the story, John Lennon sings "I buried Paul" in the "nonsense"
   coda of "Strawberry Fields."  Mr. Lennon, for his part, consistently
   claimed he singing "cranberry sauce."  Sure enough, if you listen to the
   "Take 7" version on "The Beatles Anthology 2," you can hear that he was
   telling the truth.  Of course you could also notice that Mr. McCartney has
   appeared in public countless times since 1966, but what's the fun in that?


Joe Klemm talks about how rumors get started:  The whole "Paul is dead" thing
   wasn't started the Beatles [as some have said -- Ed.], but by U. of
   Michigan student who, after hearing a radio broadcast where a DJ talked to
   someone who believe there's clues to Paul's death in the Beatles album,
   deliberately expanded what was said on the radio show by saying there are
   clues to Paul's death by mentioning some of the clues in his review of the
   Abbey Road album.


>> Like, Miscellaneous, Etc.  Can you dig?

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Do'h!  the Magic Dragon


Don Del Grande:  BONUS TRIVIA -- Dan Castellaneta and Tress MacNeille voice
   the grandfather and grandmother (well, one of each) of both Bart Simpson
   and "Hey Arnold!"'s Arnold.


Alan Hamilton:  Ex-hippies founding major corporations is fairly common, both
   in jokes and in real life, so I don't know if that referred to anyone in
   particular.  Just as an example, Celestial Seasonings.  It's named after
   one of its founders (and no, she wasn't named Seasonings).


Dennis Handly:  The correct way to open the jar is to turn it upside down and
   pound it on a flat surface.  You'll be surprised how often that works.


Benjamin Robinson:  "The munchies" is what you have when you have a craving
   for (usually) junk food.  It's one of the canonical side-effects of
   marijuana usage.

                    hippie chicks combing his long hair, as he plucks
                    at a sitar in a meadow full of flowers]
Hippie Chick #1:    Oh, Homer J., how do you keep your hair so rich and
                    full?
Homer:              Lather, rinse, and repeat.  Always repeat.
Hippie Chick #2:    Homer J., will you teach us to make love?
                    [the sitar-playing Homer smiles.  Back to reality]
Homer:              Wow.  I could have lived like that?
-- No, you couldn't, "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Seth and Munchie bring the conversation back to Homer's mom.

Seth:     You know Homer, your Mom was a pretty groovy chick.
Munchie:  And a demon in the sack!  [the two snicker]
Abe:      Oh, you heard about that, eh?  [laughs]
          [the two hippies look at each other quickly and laugh with
          him]
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Seth says that he thinks of Homer's mother every time he walks past
% the mural she painted and points to a painting on the side of a shed.
% It's a picture of him as a young child, flying through outer space.
% It reads "Let Your Spirit Soar".  Homer runs over to it, amazed his
% mother painted this for him.  Examining the picture further, he sees
% an inscription.  It reads, "With Love, To My Son Homer J-- Simpson",
% the missing letters of his middle name obscured by a small plant.

Homer:    Oh my God ... my middle name is right behind that shrub!
          I'll finally know what "J" stands for.  From this moment
          forth, I will be known as Homer ... [he pushes back the
          shrub] ... Jay Simpson!  [wipes away a tear]  It's so
          beautiful.  What a magical gift for my mother to leave me.
Seth:     She also left your old poncho.
          [kneeling down, he pulls a cloth out from under a dog]
Seth:     Get off of there, Ginsberg!
-- The dog is holy!  The poncho is holy!, "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Shaking off some fur, he hands Homer the poncho, who holds it
% lovingly to his face.  Seth suggests washing the poncho, since the dog
% has skin and bladder problems, but Homer appears oblivious to this.
% Abe declares it's time to go, and tugs Homer back to the car.
%
% Homer, being pulled away by his father, stares back at his mother's
% mural.  Abe's words about what his life would have been had his mother
% gotten her way echo through his mind ...

Abe:      [voice in Homer's head] Just lying around, never working,
          without a care in ...
Homer:    ... my head full of long, luxurious hippie hair!  I'll do it!
Abe:      What?
Homer:    I'm gonna be a hippie, just like Mom wanted!  I'm gonna let
          my spirit soar, and love all of God's creatures!
-- Someone warn the creatures, "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Homer, holding the poncho beside him, sees that "Ginsberg" is lying
% on top of it.  Yelling "Get off, you stupid dog!"  Homer knocks him
% off and  tosses the poncho over his head.  The dog growls at him.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:49]
%
% Homer stands in his living room, wearing the (unwashed) poncho and
% holding a videotape.  To be a real hippie he has to learn from the
% master -- Bob Hope.  He pops the tape in the VCR; it's one of his
% topical comedy specials.  Mr. "Flower Child" Hope and Jill St. John
% run through dialog apparently written by Eisenhower-era comics.  St.
% John invites Hope to a love-in ... with Phyllis Diller.  Eek.  Homer
% enthusiastically takes notes.
%
% At the dinner table, Homer leans back in his chair and puts up his
% dirt-caked feet.  Lisa glares at him.

Lisa:     Dad, do you mind?  Your feet are really close to my potato.
Homer:    Your potato?  You can't, like, own a potato, man.  It's one
          of Mother Earth's creatures.  [he belches]
Marge:    Homer!  Excuse yourself!
Homer:    No way, narc!  Bodily functions are a natural thing.
Bart:     No to mention hilarious.  [makes farting noises with his
          armpit]
Marge:    You know, I really don't appreciate being called a narc.  And
          that poncho is filthy!  Let me dry-clean it for you.
Homer:    [whining] Why do you have to turn everything into one big
          plastic hassle?  Marge, you've got too many hang-ups.  Like,
          the whole shaving trip.  Come on, I want to see those legs
          all furry and gross!
Marge:    That ain't gonna happen, bub.
Homer:    Well, at least lose the bra.  Free the Springfield Two,
          Marge!  Free the Springfield Two!
Marge:    Mmm, I think you've had too much strawberry wine.
-- What do the Springfield Two think?  "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Later, while Marge cleans the house, she discovers that the couch is
% missing, and at the same time hears Maude Flanders crying out in
% disgust.  In the front lawn, she sees Homer, naked, tossing a Frisbee
% in the air, while Maude, gardening, hides her eyes.

Maude:    My eyes have been soiled!
Homer:    Come on, Maude, the human wang is a beautiful thing.
Marge:    Homer, for God's sake, put your poncho on.
Homer:    Okay, okay ... narc.
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% At the Groovy Groves, Seth and Munchie play hackey-sack, when Homer
% manages to hit them both in the face with a wildly thrown Frisbee.
% The two look down to see "Homer Jay" inscribed upon the disc.

Homer:    Heads up!
Seth:     Hey!  It's Homer Jay!
Munchie:  My man!  You've gone granola!
Homer:    Right on!
Seth:     Join the hack!
          [the two hippies kick it around a bit, then pass it to Homer,
          who lofts it into the nearby pond]
Homer:    That was cool.  Think I'll stick around.  We've got
          everything we need right here.  Good times, sunshine, free
          love ... [makes purring noise]
          [suddenly, the sound of a buzzer interrupts the peace]
Munchie:  Okay, time to get back to work.
Homer:    Work?  But you're hippies!
Seth:     Oh, we were on a break.
Munchie:  Time is money, man!
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% The two open up the barn doors, revealing a complex bottling plant.
% Homer, watching a pink-labeled bottle fill with a greenish liquid,
% asks "What is this place?"

Seth:     We are the largest organic juice company in Springfield.
Munchie:  We grow our own vegetables and process them right here!  And
          we give half the profits to war orphans.
Homer:    Profits, profits, profits!  What kind of hippies are you?
          Peter Fonda must be spinning in his grave.
Seth:     We're just trying to pay the bills, Homer.  I mean, we're
          still hippies at heart.
Homer:    Oh yeah, when's the last time you freaked out the
          establishment?  You guys are total sell-outs!
Munchie:  Wait ... don't you work for a nuclear power plant?
Homer:    Look, we can sit here all day, and play the blame game, or we
          can start freaking people out.  Come on, where's your freak
          bus?
Seth:     I drive a Saturn.
Homer:    A Saturn?
Seth:     We used to have a bus.
Munchie:  In a way, the sixties ended the day we sold it.  December
          thirty-first, 1969.
Seth:     Yeah, an old-time freak-out sounds tempting, Homer, but
          [sighs] we've got a big order to fill.
Homer:    Fine.  I guess the juice business is more important than the
          ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die
          for.
Munchie:  I suppose we could duck out for a couple hours.
Seth:     Hey, we'll call it a business trip and write off the mileage!
Homer:    Now you're freak flag's flyin'!  Let the freak-out begin!
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Homer tosses his Frisbee in the air, becoming the wheel of the
% magnificently painted Saturn freak-out mobile in which the three
% drive, to the tune of "Incense and Peppermints."

Homer:    Oh ... we're never going to freak anybody out with this
          music.  I brought something from my personal stash that'll
          blow some minds!
          [Homer pops in a tape of "Uptown Girl" by Billy Joel and
          dances]
Seth:     Um, could you turn that down just a little?
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Driving down a Springfield street, Munchie blows bubbles out the
% roof.  Homer, spotting Ned Flanders, yells to him through a bullhorn
% to "expand your mind!"  Ned thanks Homer for the advice.
%
% Back in the car, Homer puts on a jester's hat, sticks his head out
% the window, and declares the "cosmic fool" his here to blow the lid
% off our stuffy world.  Krusty, riding a unicycle being pulled by a
% monkey on roller-skates, looks to the hippies and mutters "Weirdoes".
% Passing Marge carrying a bag of groceries, they come to stop.

Homer:    Hi Marge.  We're freaking out squares.
Marge:    Oh, Lord ...
Homer:    What's in your brand-new bag, momma?
Marge:    Oh, it's that pair of Dockers you wanted.  Forty-eight waist
          with the balloon seat, right?
Homer:    [panicking] Marge, not in front of the hippies!
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% ... who chuckle behind him.  At Springfield Elementary, the three of
% them walk up to the cafeteria, where Bart and Lisa eat lunch together.
% Bart prays that Homer and company stay outside, but no such luck.
% Homer bursts in the door with Seth and Munchie behind him, and
% proclaims "this conformity factory" closed.  The children in the
% cafeteria run gleefully out the door.

Hmmm.  Fifteen years of loyal service, and this is how they tell me?  A
jester with an invisible proclamation?
-- Principal Skinner, "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Homer, Seth, and Munchie pull back up to the farm to the tune of
% "Uptown Girl" and get out, relatively satisfied.  Seth is doubts
% anybody was actually freaked out, but Homer assures him that Marge
% was.
%
% Seth opens the door to the factory, and broken glass bottles spill
% out.  The two hippies scream in frustration and disbelief.  Seth finds
% the reason ... a Frisbee stuck on a tunnel at the end of a conveyor
% belt.

Seth:     Your Frisbee jammed the juicillator, Homer!
Munchie:  Our entire shipment is ruined!
Homer:    [uneasily] Pretty ... uh, freaky, huh?
Seth:     The only people who are going to be "freaked out" are our
          stockholders!
Homer:    I'm sensing some negative vibes here.  But I promise
          tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.
Seth:     There won't be any more freak-outs.  You're not a hippie, and
          you never were!
Homer:    Yes, but, but ... the poncho ...
Munchie:  Please, Homer, just leave us alone.
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Seth and Munchie begin to clean up, while Homer walks away, staring
% at the mural his mother painted years ago.  His boyhood image on the
% wall begins to speak with him with disgust.

Little Homer:  How could you let me turn into you?
Homer:         But, but, but, but ... the poncho ...
Little Homer:  [mockingly] Buh, buh, buh, buh, the poncho ... hit the
               road, square.
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Homer walks away from the barn and tosses his Frisbee away.
% Suddenly, it turns around in mid-flight and floats back toward the
% farm.  "Uh, oh", Homer says, watching it as it flies into a window of
% the juice processing plant, shattering it.  Munchie, from inside,
% yells, "Oh, for cryin' out loud!".
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  14:53]
%
% At the residence of our favorite family, the news is on.

Brockman:      Stunned league officials say point-shaving may have
               occurred in as many as three Harlem Globetrotters'
               games.  And, in business news, Groovy Grove Juice
               Corporation has announced it will miss delivery on its
               third quarter shipment.  A spokesman attributed the
               production shutdown to a half-witted oaf.
Homer:         Aww, it was sweet of those guys to blame an oaf.  But
               really, it was my fault.  I just don't have the
               discipline to be a hippie.
Marge:         Ooh, does this mean you're going to start showering
               again?
Homer:         Perhaps, in time.
Bart:          Aw, cheer up, Dad.  You make a great hippie.
Homer:         Aw, you're just saying that.
Bart:          No, really.  You're lazy and self-righteous ...
Lisa:          ... and the soles of your feet are jet black!
Homer:         Well, I do walk through pretty much anything.  Oh, you
               kids are sweet.
Marge:         I know you feel bad about the juice incident, but I'm
               sure you can make up for it somehow.
Homer:         That's it!  Somehow!
-- Eh, that's your answer for everything, "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% That night, Homer sneaks about the Groovy Grove Natural Farm.
% Peeking into the window, he sees Seth and Munchie asleep.  He promises
% to set things right while they sleep.
%
% Getting to work, Homer begins harvesting carrots and processing them,
% quietly and secretly, though getting attacked by gophers several
% times.  When morning rolls around, Homer greets his hippie friends
% just outside the front door.

Homer:    [to Munchie] Good morning, starshine!  [to Seth] Seth.
Munchie:  [gasps] What's going on?
Seth:     What happened to our crops?
Homer:    I picked 'em, juiced 'em, and delivered 'em to every store in
          town.  Your business is saved!
Munchie:  But there weren't enough vegetables left to fill that order!
Homer:    Eh!  That's what I thought at first.  But then I found the
          other garden behind the barn!  The one with the camouflage
          netting!
Munchie:  Uh, oh.
Seth:     Homer ... those were our =personal= vegetables.
Homer:    Well, now the whole town can benefit from their nutrients.
-- More than they know, "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Groundskeeper Willie, at the elementary school, tosses back a bottle
% of the hippie juice.  Opening his eyes, he sees Fergie, leaning
% against a purple tree while stars float by.  He drops the bottle in
% disbelief.  Fergie beckons Willy to come closer, and the two embrace
% passionately.  In reality, Willie, walking over to a regular tree, has
% a rake in his hands, which he uses to claw up his face, sighing
% contentedly.
%
% Elsewhere, Barney Gumble stands next to his refrigerator and guzzles
% a bottle, causing him to see a greyish goblin dancing menacingly upon
% his couch.  Panicking, he tosses back a Duff, at which point he is
% saved by a large pink elephant that comes through his front door,
% crushing the creature.

Thanks, pinkie!  You've always been there for me!
-- Barney, "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% The elephant tips his hat and winks.  On one of Springfield's nicer
% looking streets, Ned Flanders drives his car while drinking a bottle
% of Homer's juice.  Stopping at a crosswalk, he stares in shock as
% Grateful Dead bears walk by, a skeleton tips his hat (skull attached)
% to wish him good morning, the hammers from Pink Floyd's "The Wall"
% march by, and the Rolling Stones' lips fly at him.  He screams.
%
% Meanwhile, on a park bench somewhere, Abe and Jasper sit laughing
% stupidly and uncontrollably, each with a bottle of the vegetable
% drink.
%
% Down at the police station, Chief Wiggum looks over to see one of his
% officers spinning in a chair, laughing dreamily, holding a bottle of
% Homer's beverage.

Wiggum:   Lou!  Lou, are you all right?
Lou:      The electric yellow has got me by the brain banana ...
Wiggum:   I ... see.
          [Chief Wiggum takes the bottle from Lou's hand and dabs his
          finger with it, giving it a taste]
Wiggum:   My God, it's nothing but carrots and peyote.
Eddie:    Damn longhairs never learn, Chief.
Wiggum:   Eh, it's time for an old-fashioned hippie ass-whomping!
-- Any time's a good time for that, "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Moments later, three squad cars and a police truck and tank pull up
% to Groovy Grove.  Wiggum addresses the house's inhabitants with a
% bullhorn.

Wiggum:   Attention hippies!  Come out peacefully so we can smash your
          drug mill and all your worldly possessions!
Seth:     Officer, please.  We can explain.
Homer:    Not so fast, pig.  We're making a stand!  A freaky stand!
          You can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll
          have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!
Munchie:  This man does not represent us.
Wiggum:   All right, boys, set your nightsticks on "whomp".
Eddie:    Uh, mine's ... stuck on twirl.
Wiggum:   Oh, for the love of ... [sets baton] there.  Now let's crack
          some skulls.
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% The cops advance on them, anxious to crack a few skulls, when Homer
% puts his arms around his juice-making associates.

Homer:    Seth, Munchie.  They can destroy our bodies and our ponchos,
          but they can never silence our song of protest!  [singing]
          Uptown girl, she's been living in her white-bread world ...
          come on, guys!
Wiggum:   Forget the clubs, just shoot 'em!
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% The police officers each hold up a rifle, cocking them loudly; Homer
% makes his final stand.

Homer:    Look at yourselves!  Pointing guns at your fellow man.
          Hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free.  Yes, the
          sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since
          extinguished, but it's ideals live on!
          [gathering a handful of daisies, he places a flower into the
          barrels of each officer's rifle; with every one, he invokes
          the names of those ideals]
          Freedom!  Love!  And peace.
          [as he places the last flower inside Chief Wiggum's rifle, he
          screams "D'oh" when the gun goes off]
-- "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Later, at the Springfield Cemetery, a small group gathers for a
% funeral.
%
% Elsewhere, at the Springfield Hospital, Homer lies in a hospital bed
% with a flower stuck in his forehead.  His family and Dr. Hibbert look
% on.

Marge:    Doctor, will he be all right?
Hibbert:  Yes, he was lucky.  If that had been a gladiola, he'd be dead
          right now.
Bart:     Why don't you just pull it out?
Hibbert:  [laughs] I'm a doctor, not a gardener!
Homer:    Can't you just prune some of the leaves so I can watch TV?
Hibbert:  What did I just say?
-- I'm a doctor, not a gardener, dammit!  "D'oh-in' in the Wind"

% Instead of the normal credits, we see a psychedelic background, as
% the Simpsons theme is played on sitar.  Homer sings a few lines from
% "Uptown Girl," over the credits.  When the Gracie Films logo is shown,
% he murmurs, "I buried Flanders".
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time (including credits, up to Gracie Films
% logo):  21:11]
