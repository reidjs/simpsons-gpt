> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   (Canadian):  Homer is devastated to learn that he accidentally bought a car
   that is strong enough for a man, but made for a woman, prompting a car swap
   with Marge, who becomes high on power behind the wheel of the dainty-
   mobile.  Country singer Hank Williams Jr. guest-voices as the Canyonero
   pitchman.  {hl}

==============================================================================
Blackboard:     GRAMMAR IS NOT A \ TIME OF WASTE

Couch:          The family runs in to sit on the couch, which now has a safety
                bar attached to it.  When they sit down, the bar lowers,
                locking them in place.  Then, the Simpsons take a wild ride
                around their own living room.  [Recycled from AABF02]

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... "El Barto" has visited the Springfield Police station

Jon Blum:
   ... Edna's voice seemed really different.  ("they can hire new voices, and
       no one can tell the difference!")
   ... Bart has a very large nasal cavity?
   ... Lisa actually wanted to go to an animal park?  (PC-thug mode must be
       dormant in comparison to 8-year old girl mode this week ...)

Ellen Cohen:
   ... the opening number of "Edu-Tainment" is supposed to be how the
       performers love to be teachers, but about half the performers are not
       teachers?  (i.e. Otto, Groundskeeper Willie, Lunchlady Doris and
       Supernintendo Chalmers)  [{gw} points out that Willie did do temporary
       duty as a French teacher -- Ed.]
   ... Krusty the Clown actually went to the performance at the school?  Does
       he have kids or know one of the teachers?
   ... even though Marge can see through the wall into the kitchen, and can
       see Bart wearing tonight's dinner as pants, she only reprimands him for
       going through her purse?
   ... while Homer is being dragged around by the rhinoceros, he informs the
       construction workers, "It's not my rhino!"
   ... Homer [...] has forgotten the DMY creed?

Nathan DeHoff:
   ... the Canyonero doesn't seem to be quite as wide as it was last season?
   ... Kearney's "interruption" of the traffic school film seemed fairly
       "cartoonish"?
   ... Springfield has a zoo, an animal refuge, and a wild animal park?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Lunch Lady Doris has a "speaking part"?
   ... Homer can hot-wire Marge's car?
   ... Marge's car's hood can be opened entirely from the outside?
   ... somebody gave Homer financial credit?  (see 7G09 for what happened the
       last time)
   ... when Homer asks Marge if she thinks he's gay, he's holding her purse
       with both hands?
   ... Evergreen Terrace has its own exit sign?
   ... Lisa carries Maggie into the car?

Yuri Dieujuste:
   ... the Bush/Ford house is missing?

Jordan Eisenberg:
   ... Marge's hair blocks part of the stage at the assembly?
   ... Superintendent Chalmers falls on the floor when Skinner, who was right
       under him in the pyramid, jumps off?
   ... while carting away 32 grocery bags, Marge keeps her eye off of the road
       for a very long time?
   ... both episodes to feature the Canyonero were the 10th in their
       production lines?  (5F10 and AABF10)

Curtis Gibby:
   ... Wiggum knows the word "aplomb"?

Andrew Gill:
   ... the X on Snake's forehead (again)?
   ... stubbiness apparently runs in the Wiggum family, too?

Joe Green:
   ... the young, androgynous cop in the Road Rage movie?

John Jensen:
   ... Marge's comment "go back to New Jersey" was amusing because NJ drivers
       would normally be considered the reckless ones.
   ... they actually DID knock out one of the rhinos with popcorn!

Damien Jones:
   ... Lou was going to return the Curtis E. Bear costume although it was
       wrecked?

Joe Klemm:
   ... one rhino laying near Marge's old car during the attack?
   ... NBC was finishing up NBA coverage when Marge tells viewers to see
       what's on that channel?

Haynes Lee:
   ... "this both sucks and blows" is a very fitting comment?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... Homer seemed enticed by Mrs. Krabappel in 8F16, but now he seems to be
       repulsed by her?
   ... objects are thrown at someone twice this episode?
   ... this is the first time we've seen Homer wear a belt with his usual
       outfit since I believe 7F18?

Paul Melnyk:
   ... at first impression, the guy on the O.K. Cor-ral [sign] looks like
       Smithers in the Simpsons Spinoff Showcase?
   ... Marge calling Hans Moleman "Grandma"?
   ... inmates at Springfield Minimum Security Prison need the fence to break
       to escape?
   ... isotope flag in background in Moe's bar?

Mark Aaron Richey:
   ... in the couch gag, Homer and Marge duck when the bar comes down?
   ... the GPS system?
   ... the ice cream dripping all over the seats?
   ... The expression on Hans' face when he changed lanes?
   ... the guy sleeping in the class?
   ... the astronaut is holding a golf club?
   ... Curtis E. Bear is pretty beaten up outside?
   ... Apu shaking hands with Kearney?
   ... Moe shaking hands with Krusty?
   ... the cars turned over in the parking lot?
   ... one of the construction workers drops a pickax?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... the amount of cross-gender addressing in this episode?  (See "Personal
       Comment & Observations")
   ... the first strike chips Curtis E. Bear's tooth?

Samuel Sklaroff:
   ... one of the people running from the park looks like Matt Groening?

Mike Smith:
   ... Rev. Lovejoy doesn't know Marge was driving?
   ... OFF didn't know what program NBC is airing at that moment?  [See
       "Comments" section for more]

Gary Wilson:
   ... it *is* of course physically possible for something to suck and blow,
       especially when thought of literally?
   ... Homer is simply eating plain salt while in the car?  [Or maybe not.
       See "Goofs" section -- Ed.]
   ... Mrs. Krabapple actually showed her butt in her performance?
   ... Krusty's Canyonero appears to be the women's version as well (or looks
       exactly the same)?
   ... Krusty calls Marge a clown, despite the obvious fact that he is a clown
       as well?
   ... the Canyonero blatantly says "buy me!" on it?
   ... Hans Moleman no longer drives a Gremlin?
   ... Chief Wiggum thinks "road rage" is a technical term?
   ... Lisa says the animals are not there to entertain them, when they really
       are?
   ... Kent Brockman doesn't know the Simpsons' names, despite the fact that
       he has met them all numerous times and Lisa is a frequent guest on his
       show?

=  [There were] two different viewpoints in auditorium, and two different
   lightings, from point of view of stage  {pm}

*  There doesn't seem to be any place in the auditorium for a spotlight to be
   coming from.  {je}

   blank.  {je}

+  In 3G03 Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(ANNOYED GRUNT)cious  Willie claims to
   "hail from" Glasgow, and in 5F20  Lard of the Dance he claims North
   Kiltstown.  Now it appears to be Edinburgh.  {gw}

+  Homer seemed enticed by Mrs. Krabappel in 8F16, but now he seems to be
   repulsed by her  {ol}

=  Homer eats pretzels from a  box labeled "Salt".  {dj}

=  The Simpsons' car looks red like the Canyonero, but their two cars are pink
   and purple [orange, actually -- Ed.].  {dj}

*  Since when can Homer afford a Canyonero?  {jg}

*  Gil only dialed 3 digits, but his call went through.  {tpe}

=  On the overhead shot of the house right after Homer finds out about the F-
   series, the cars are not in the driveway.  In the next shot, when Homer is
   begging Marge to take the Canyonero, they are in the driveway.  {mar}

-  The window in OFF's living room seems to be much wider than usual.  {je}

=  The sunroof disappears temporarily when Marge enters the car.  (Her hair
   couldn't have covered the entire sunroof.)  {ddg}

*  On Marge's onboard car computer, any name with 6+ characters wouldn't fit.
   {pm}

+  Since when was there a freeway so close to the Simpsons' house?  {bc}

=  When Marge gets stuck in traffic, she pulls up behind an aqua four-door
   sedan.  When she leaves the road, the car ahead is a tan VW Beetle.  {bjr}

*  Bart sprays whip-cream up his nose, yet it just wipes off.  {pm}

=  When Marge presses the "4 X 4" button, there is no "LOW" button below it.
   In most of the other dashboard shots, there is.  {bjr}

+  The houses across the street from the Simpsons (for example, the one that
   George Bush lived in) are no longer there, and the lots have been vacant
   long enough for grass to grow there.  {ddg}

+  It's not the inter-episode continuity I'm worried about, but houses were
   even shown across the street in earlier scenes of the same episode, but
   aren't there as Marge escapes the interstate.  {je}

*  How did Lisa know she was being spied on by Marge?  {je}

+  Marge was installing the headlights, but in the song, they are implied to
   be standard: "She blinds everybody with her superhigh beams ..." (Unless
   she was just adjusting them, or they are optional equipment).  {jj}

*  When Marge is testing out her high-beam headlights, which apparently allow
   her to see through walls, we see Lisa in the kitchen with Bart, who is
   wearing a turkey [chicken, actually -- Ed.], and nothing else.  By the time
   Homer gets into the kitchen, Bart has managed to remove the turkey and
   completely re-dress.  {jm}

   driving down the highway.  {mar}

=  When Marge goes off the road to pass cars, she goes through some bushes,
   but the bushes appear to be undisturbed.  {ddg}

-  When Marge rolls her window up and down, the top edge "grows" to conform
   with the frame, rather than staying in the triangular shape it should have.
   {je}

=  most of the "Road Rage" movie was on the take-up reel?  {ddg}

=  Krusty's nose is white when they show Eddie's point of view.  {ss}

=  Apu is seen outside the driving class, when we never saw him inside it.
   {mar}

*  The Canyonero should have crushed Agnes Skinner's and Kearney's cars.  This
   also could have killed the two of them.  {yd}

=  Bart didn't have his slingshot when he entered the zoo.  {je}

*  In order for saying "Jumanji" to do anything (even in the movie and book)
   Homer would have had to have won the game, which he didn't even begin
   playing?  (picky, picky but what they hey)  {gw}

*  When Bart and Lisa jumped into the car through the sunroof, they should
   have landed in the front seats, not the back.  {ddg}

*  Lisa and Bart were still in car when it crashed.  [Well, maybe not, since I
   didn't see them.  Of course, that raises the question of how they got to
   the construction site -- Ed.]  {pm}

c  Homer's "NBC sucks" comments over the closing credits are not captioned.

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Rich Bunnell:  Nearly as disjointed as the season low-point "Kidney Trouble."
   Some funny moments, but the plot couldn't seem to hold itself together and
   the NBC joke at the end was pretty lame, even though Homer's voice-over
   during the credits was hilarious.  Still, I didn't laugh at a whole lot
   this episode.  The 4th mediocre episode this season (along with Bart The
   Mother, Kidney Trouble, and D'oh-ing In The Wind), and I find that weird
   since in the past 9 seasons, there were maybe 3 or more, TOTAL, that I
   didn't care for.  (C)

Ellen Cohen:  I enjoyed this one, even though I missed about five minutes in
   the middle.  As you know I love the Marge-centric episodes!  I never broke
   out hysterically laughing out loud, but there were some truly funny bits,
   like Bart pulling on "chicken pants" and Courtney Love on a Wheaties box.
   I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm glad Homer wasn't such a jerk in
   this episode.  That brings up my grade, sad to say!  I wouldn't necessarily
   say "a bland timid entry for those recovering from surgery", but I give it
   a B+!  Maybe the writers are pulling themselves out of the pit, finally.
   (B+)

Ben Collins:  Yawn.  What a pointless episode.  Marge the road rager doesn't
   interest me.  At least it focuses on a character other than Homer, and all
   characters are put to good use for a change.  A few giggles here and there
   (Bart and Lisa's sibling rivalry, the traffic school film), but not much.
   My interest in new episodes is starting to fade big time.  (D+)

Yuri Dieujuste:  This episode was decent.  The writing made sense and the
   episode was well executed.  I liked having Homer as a secondary character
   after seeing him as a major character for most of the season.  (B+)

Jordan Eisenberg:  This was one of those episode I wanted to re-watch
   immediately at 8:30, because it made me laugh so much.  Sadly, once I've
   seen all the jokes, there's not a lot left that will make me want to watch
   it a thousand times later on.  We have a few recycled jokes here and there,
   a great Jurassic Park parody, and nice focus on the family, but we also
   have a very uninteresting plotline (once you take all the gags away), a
   painfully cartoony zoo scene and another spotlight stolen by Homer.  I
   don't mind the overly-polished animation as much as some do, but I wish the
   writing could be just as polished.  (B-)

Curtis Gibby:  Simply awful.  This episode was reminiscent of the early ones
   where Marge goes nuts, which I've always hated.  I'm not saying that we
   can't have a Marge-centric episode (I liked "The Springfield Connection" a
   lot), but if it isn't funny, I really don't like it.  I didn't think we
   could get much worse than "Homer to the Max," but <ding ding ding> we have
   a winner!  The jokes just fell flat-- I didn't laugh out loud once.  (D)

Andrew Gill:  Well, you can't win `em all.  Almost every aspect of this
   episode made me wonder why this was happening.  No incident seemed to have
   any proper impetus.  That having been said, however, I liked the premise.
   Lisa using physical violence seemed a little out of character, also.  (D+)

Joe Green:  Intensely funny at moments, but slowed down for much of the
   half-hour.  I enjoyed seeing Marge's dark side come out for once.  The
   ending came out of nowhere and managed to feel like a cop-out even though
   it didn't actually resolve the main plot.  (B-)

Darrel Jones:  A slightly-above-average episode, rescued from blahdom by the
   excellent NBC-Fox [bit] done at the end.  The other highlight was the
   school talent show.  But Wiggum need to stop uttering "That ---- was only
   one day from retirement" lines.  And Gil really should have gotten credit
   for that car-sale.  (B-)

Joe Klemm:  I am unsure about how to rate the plot to this episode, though
   I'll bet that a few people will believe that the rhino attack was tagged
   on. However, the jokes that they use, including the bear bashing bit and
   the whole NBC crack, were clever in the style of the writers.  (B-)

Haynes Lee:  Kind of a Duffless retread but the rhino stampede was the
   greatest animal attack scene ever in the Simpsons series.  The Hank William
   Jr. scene was tacked in though.  (B-)

Jake Lennington:  I was actually excited when I saw the previews, but when I
   saw the actual episode, I barely laughed or felt for the characters in any
   way.  Too many gags seemed drawn out, and the dialog seemed a bit bland, as
   well.  Boring.  BTW, can we please stop with the animal attacks!  (D+)

Ondre Lombard:  The first truly different Marge plot in a long time, but
   unfortunately, it turns into the sort of story "In Marge We Trust" was.
   Not really quite as dull and aimless, but still, the ending is very tacked
   on and reminds me a lot of Ned Flanders' baboon rescue.  [...] If this were
   a fanscript, I don't think it'd get many high marks for humor.  I had a few
   chuckles, but there isn't too much that's funny here at all.  And it isn't
   really because it's a Marge-based episode; other characters have lousy
   lines and a lot of jokes are weak or predictable.  (Such as Homer joining
   Bart in ransacking Marge's purse.)  And God, somebody shoot Gil.  He isn't
   funny.  I suppose the best part of this episode was the Road Rage film.
   (D+)

Paul Melnyk:  This Episode was pretty funny.  The first act wasn't top par,
   the teacher skit was ok.  Gil's appearance was amusing, but didn't have the
   chest-pain-stimulus laughs he had in "Natural Born Kissers".  The Second
   act was great, from the hilarious film clip, to the funeral, to the purse
   robbery.  Third act also was great.  The NBC skit was funny at first, but
   got old upon second viewing.  (A-)

Thomas Rinschler:  The first half of the episode had some quality parts
   dealing with Marge's developing road rage.  Unfortunately, the entire
   portion dealing with the rhino escape was a bit over-the-top.  Overall, a
   somewhat disappointing episode.  (B-)

Matt Rose:  Well, this was pleasantly surprising ... It's rare these days when
   they can make a good episode about Marge.  Great opening moments with
   Skinner and Krabapple being so true to form ... also the return of funny
   public-service films. Can't really say I liked the overall wackiness of the
   rhino scenes but the first two acts were a treat.  For a late-season
   Simpsons episode, this is about as enjoyable as they come.  "The Simpsons"
   to me is a shadow of it's former self these past couple of seasons, but it
   can still be quite entertaining once in awhile.  (B)

Jason Rosenbaum:  I have to say, I was slightly surprised when I saw this
   episode.  It didn't have a good plot.  I mean, nothing is funny about road
   rage.  When I'm in my car with my dad and he gets angry, I want to leave.
   Marge was exactly the same.  Her road rage wasn't funny, thus making the
   plot superficial and worthless.  However, nobody, not even me, can deny
   that this episode had some great gags.  The beginning was the funniest of
   the season, and the NBC gag at the end equally funny.  But this episode
   lacked stability.  It was a bunch of gags thrown against a wall with
   Marge's road rage.  Not a great episode, but still, much better than I
   expected.  (C)

Gary Wilson:  Well, I liked it.  I liked the (long) jab at Fox,  I liked The
   Talent Show and I liked the whole damn show.  On this viewing it seemed
   overly wacky, but some of the best episodes have been this way and that is
   not necessarily a problem, just a fact.  All the characters had a lot of
   good lines.  The plot was a little bit too non-existent for me, but when it
   has a lot of jokes that make me laugh, what can I say?  I think maybe
   watching the episode in company adds to the humor.  When I watch alone or
   with my equally critical sister, I rarely find reason to laugh.  But the
   truth is, most people (non die-hard fans) laugh hysterically at the newer
   shows, and for whatever reason, that makes it more funny.  Grade  (B+)

Yours Truly:  Putting Marge behind the wheel of an SUV is a perfect excuse to
   let her go wild, letting her shed some of her inhibitions without breaking
   her character.  There's also some good moments from the kids, especially on
   a trip home from the store.  However, like the Canyonero itself, the show
   is slightly too big, and its humor stretched slightly too thin.  It's a
   good episode, but needs a minor tune-up.  (B)

>> The SUV Mystique

Benjamin Robinson speculates:  Modern civilization has its rewards -- a nice
   home, the rule of law, "The Simpsons" on every Sunday night -- but it has
   its price, as well. Everyday commitments press down upon us, until life is
   just an endless series of errands:  go to work, go pick up the kids at
   school, go drop off the kids at Little League, go to 7-11 for those little
   juice boxes Junior insists on having, go the Home Depot for a new toilet
   valve, go nuts.

   This wasn't how man was meant to live, was it?  We were meant to be bold
   rugged explorers, wandering nomads who can go where we please and do what
   we want.  Perhaps that is so, but nobody wants to sleep under the stars
   when they could be cozying up at home with a good book.  So, Detroit gave
   us the next best thing -- the Sport Utility Vehicle.  No longer were you a
   harried middle manager or time-starved soccer mom. Now you were fearless
   navigator exploring unknown territory, a mountaineer .li [*] carving out a
   new niche (except most woodsmen didn't carry infant seats on their
   journeys)!  And for some reason the illusion persists, even though every
   SUV driver knows that every other SUV driver is just heading down to the
   supermarket for baby food.

   [*] Not coincidentally, Mercury sells an SUV called the "Mountaineer."


>> Well, we didn't call them SAFE utility vehicles

Benjamin Robinson:  Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) have a partially deserved
   reputation for being accident prone.  A typical SUV sits high above the
   ground and is heavier than a standard car or truck.  This unfortunate
   combination means a higher-than-normal center of gravity, and an
   accompanying tendency to roll over.  Perversely enough, this is most likely
   to happen while swerving out of the way in an emergency, when you most need
   stable handling.

   Paradoxically, many people consider SUVs among the safest vehicles on the
   road.  Some of the bigger SUVs are practically massive enough to have their
   own gravitational field, so in a collision between you and just about
   anything else on the road, you win.  (All bets are off if you collide with
   some other Suburban-driving soccer mom, though.)  Insurance companies have
   taken note of this, and want to jack up the liability rates for these
   behemoths.

   One SUV dealer was quoted as saying every time a "SUVs mean death to
   everyone else on the road" story runs, his sales go through the roof.
   Makes you wonder what =really= motivates people to drive these things.


Yuri Dieujuste adds:  IMHO, I detest most of these cars.  I hate those
   vehicles because they waste gasoline and cause more pollution, they cause
   more fatal accidents, and they have soured up the import market for
   Japanese sports cars.  Also many of the people who own these cars cannot
   drive them.  Anyone who lives in an area that snows often can see this on
   any highway (I think this is due to poor shifting between 2x4 and 4X4).

   Personally, the types of cars I prefer are Japanese and European sports
   cars and sedans.  If I wanted a 4WD vehicle, I would go buy a Subaru or an
   Audi. Yes these cars are 4WDs and they are at normal height, but they
   perform better.

   Eventually, gasoline will become more expensive than CDs and everybody will
   come crawling back to cheaper, smaller fuel-efficient cars.


>> Now that's Edutaining!

Andrew Gill:  In an attempt to expand the home-use market, computer companies
   have been trying to sell programs referred to as "edu-tainment" for several
   years.  These are usually things like "Math Blaster" or "Vocabulary
   Blaster", where it's intended to be both educational *and* fun.  Usually,
   it winds up being neither.  Anyone remember "Oregon Trail"?


>> "This both sucks and blows"

No it doesn't, says Karl Clodfelter:  Sorry, but "physically" speaking, it is
   completely impossible for anything to "suck".  There is the situation where
   the pressure in one place (outside the space shuttle) is lower than the
   pressure in another place (inside the shuttle).  If you create a place for
   the two pressures to equilibrate (an open door), then you get a push or
   "blow" effect from the molecules inside the shuttle going out the door.
   But science just doesn't "suck".


>> So who *was* on first, anyway?

Joe Klemm tells us how this routine is supposed to work:  Who's on First is a
   comical routine done by Abbott and Costello.  In it, Abbott runs down the
   line-up of a baseball team he has, with Costello confused with the players
   names, particularly a certain first baseman by the name of Who.


>> Must've been working the concession stand

A couple people noticed non-teachers like Chalmers were in the "That's Edu-
   Tainment!" cast.  Todd Emerson notes who *wasn't* there:  where was Mr.
   Largo?  Or Mrs. Pummehorst?  And whatever happened to the female teacher
   who once said, "Always with the magnets!"  Or the male (ponytailed) teacher
   who asked his class, "Did I ever tell you kids about the '60s?"


>> A tale of two columnists

Mark Aaron Richey:  Erma Bombeck -- Best-selling humor writer whose
   observations about everyday life and her family won her a loyal following.
   She died a few years back.

   Dave Berry -- Best-selling humor writer whose observations about everyday
   life and his family won him a loyal following.  The two writers are quite
   similar, though Berry appeals more to guys than Bombeck does.


>> Global Proving Grounds

Andrew Gill explains how this option works:  One of the newest extras for the
   automobile is the GPS (or "Global Positioning System") computer.  By
   triangulating your location from several satellites, it can tell you
   exactly where in the world you are, what roads you should take, how far to
   your destination, &c., all within a few hundred feet.  The military can
   find its location to within a few hundred cm, since the civilian GPS
   systems are intentionally wrong, so that enemy missile can't knock the
   satellites out of commission.  I'm not sure exactly how long this has been
   around, but I remember seeing a clip on them which used a C=64 like
   cartridge for software, so it's been a while.

   Of course, there has been some stupidity surrounding the use of these
   machines.  I remember, just recently, someone drove into a lake because the
   GPS told him that it was still the road.


>> Where is Springfield?

Speaking of GPS, Jordan Eisenberg shows how it might shed light on this
   eternal thread:  On the SUV computer screen, the map depicts the entire
   United States, which is illogical for most drivers ...  unless its creators
   don't want us to know which state it's in.  (Or Homer just hadn't
   programmed the information in yet, even though I suspect such a thing would
   be automated.)  That is, if that makes any sense ...


>> Eat your Wheaties, and be just like Courtney

Looks like Lisa isn't a Courtney Love fan.  If you aren't, either, Benjamin
   Robinson explains who she is:  Courtney Love is the loose-cannon lead
   singer (although she's been trying to rehabilitate her image lately) for
   the band Hole.  Her pose on the box of Wheaties -- one leg up, and spread
   off to the side -- was pretty typical of her in-concert appearance.


Mark Aaron Richey adds:  Grunge rocker, frontwoman for the band Hole, and
   widow of Kurt Cobain.  She is also an occasional actress, winning raves a
   couple of years ago for "The People vs. Larry Flynt".


>> Still missing Phil

Daniel W. Mielcarz:  Did anyone else miss Troy McClure during the road rage
   film?  I can see it now "Hi, I'm Troy McClure.  You might remember me from
   such driver education films as 'Right turn on red: Now legal in 49 states'
   and 'So, you've hit a dog'"


Jamie Gregorian agrees:  You know, I was thinking the EXACT SAME thing when I
   saw that.  Even though I knew he wouldn't be in it, when that filmstrip
   started, it just seemed weird to have anyone other than Troy narrating.
   Not to mention disappointing.


>> What was that dancing animal?

According to Christian Kammerer:  [The tranquilized animal is a] three-toed
   sloth, well known for being the world's most sluggish and immovable mammal.
   The fact that the tranquilizer made it dance is the joke, since sloth's
   can't possibly be more tranquil than they are the drug must make them
   hyperactive.


>> How not to stop a charging rhino

Joe Klemm:  Jumanji is a 1995 movie based on an award-winning children's book
   .li [by Chris Van Allsburg, according to {mar}].  In it, two kids and two
   adults, including Robin Williams, must play and finish a board game the
   adults started when they were kids.  However, each move leads to a jungle-
   related peril for the gang to face, from a stampede to a hunter searching
   for poor Robin.  How Homer tries to stop the rhinos refers to the way for
   the game to end, with the player landing on his/her last space saying
   Jumanji.


>> Coming up on "Dateline Wednesday," an investigation of shoddy journalism
   on "Dateline Sunday"

Mark Aaron Richey writes:  [A] highly popular, if critically panned
   newsmagazine that seems to be on for 16 hours a week (actually, only 5).
   Stone Phillips is the chief anchor (also often critically panned).  The
   conversation might have also been a veiled ref to the 1992 scandal where
   Dateline rigged a pickup truck (I can't remember if it was Ford or GM) to
   explode upon impact.


Benjamin Robinson talks about that scandal:  Speaking of SUVs and safety,
   Marge mentions a "Dateline" report where she learned the trucks burst into
   flame easily.  Most likely, she's remembering a segment that lambasted the
   fuel tank design of Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickups (ironically, SUVs
   weren't mentioned -- just the pickups).  Until a redesign in the early
   Nineties, the trucks' fuel tanks were mounted on the sides of the vehicle,
   outside the frame rails normally used to shield the tank.  "Dateline's"
   contention was that the tanks would explode in a side-impact collision, and
   to prove their point, they T-boned a Chevy truck.  Sure enough, it went up
   in a ball of flame.  Unfortunately for NBC, it later came out that the
   truck was rigged to explode on cue.  The "Dateline" folks confessed to
   having been duped, and for a while it looked like the whole "Dateline"
   franchise would have been killed.  (Fortunately for NBC, the public forgot
   about the matter, allowing the network to expand "Dateline" to, oh, about
   nine times a week.)


>> NBC's wonderful lineup

Benjamin Robinson wonders:  Hmmm, what =is= on NBC tonight?  I think I'll go
   flip through "TV Guide."  .li [flip, flip, flip]  Ah, the last half-hour of
   the Lakers-Sonics game.  I suppose that's nice if you're a basketball fan.
   [Tom R. notes, "And in the East Coast, 'Eraser' with Ah-nold was
   beginning," presumably right after the game -- Ed.]  Personally, if "The
   Simpsons" wasn't on, I'd probably be watching "Mr. Holland's Opus," on ABC
   instead.

   When there isn't a b-ball game on, NBC airs "Dateline" in the 8:00-9:00
   slot on Sundays; this might be why "The Simpsons'" producers sarcastically
   plugged that program.  It looks like they didn't predict that NBC would
   give Stone Phillips and crew the night off.  D'oh!


>> RuPaul's revenge

Benjamin Robinson talks about some subtle gender-bending on tonight's show:
   As I mentioned in the DYNs, there was more cross-gender addressing (calling
   a man by a women's form of addressing, and vice versa) than usual in this
   show.  For instance:

   * The guys at the plant call Homer a "soccer mom."
   * Bart says, "You the man, mom" when Marge crosses the field.
   * Marge yells "Move it, Grandma" to Hans Moleman.
   * Snake calls Marge "chick-dude" when thanking her.


>> Car Watch -- and this time, it's personal

Benjamin Robinson writes:  Aw, c'mon, you just knew there was going to be a
   "Car Watch" for this episode!

   There's a tan Volkswagen Beetle ahead of Marge when she and the Canyonero
   are stuck in traffic.

   Hans Moleman drives a Ford Contour (the original kind with the small grille
   and headlights).

   Kearney has evidently traded up from the Hyundai, because here he drives a
   Beetle, this time an orange convertible.  (And in real life, they did come
   in that color.)

   [{tpe} vouches for this, saying, "My dad had to rent an orange Beetle back
   when the family car broke down when I was a kid ('73 or so).  He tells me
   that I said the car looked like one of those Union 76 antenna balls.  Ha!"]


>> The End

Jordan Eisenberg muses about tonight's end credits:  What will happen to the
   credits once this episode enters syndication?  It looks like the dialogue
   was perfectly befitting the shortened prime-time credits, because it was
   tied time-wise to the beginning and end.  (Those whose stations talk over
   the credits won't have to worry about this, though.)

   There's a bitter irony in Homer retracting his NBC promotion over the
   credits, because any Fox affiliate that talks over the syndicated credits
   to promote themselves will only be compounding their follies by leaving a
   flamboyantly in-your-face NBC promotion unresolved.


Andrew Gill predicts:  I suspect that .li [the ending] will just fade into the
   end credits, like what was done with the Prof. Frink song at the end of .li
   [3F18].


Ondre Lombard:  If most Fox stations running Simpsons are anything like the
   Los Angeles affiliate, they wait until the middle of the credits to either
   talk over the credits or split the screen for a promo.  (I guess I wouldn't
   put it past some station in Colorado to run a promo blowing away the entire
   end credits much like Frasier's credits are murdered by a split-screen news
   promo in Los Angeles.)


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

Lenny:    Oh, sorry Homer.  We thought you were one of those hot-to-
          trot soccer moms.
Carl:     Yeah, you don't see many men driving the F-series.  [Lenny
          and Carl indicate badge on side of truck]
Homer:    Huh?
Lenny:    [reaches in the window, and pulls something out]  See,
          instead of a cigarette lighter, it's got a lipstick holder.
Homer:    Aw, crap, it's a girls' car!  I can't drive this.
Lenny:    Oh sure you can, dollface.  [makes kissy noises]
Carl:     Heh, heh, pretty thing like you can do whatever she wants.
          [Lenny and Carl share a laugh]
Homer:    Shut up!  Screw you guys!  [drives off]
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Homer won't suffer the indignity of being seen in the F-series, so he
% opts for something a little more masculine -- Marge's station wagon.
% When Marge won't give him the keys, he pretends to walk to his
% Canyonero, only reach under the hood of Marge's car at the last
% second.  He hot-wires it, jumps in, and roars off.
%
% Marge still has to do her grocery shopping, and the Canyonero is the
% only vehicle available.  She walks up to the enormous truck, and eyes
% it suspiciously.

Marge:         Good Lord.  How am I supposed to get in this beast?
               [opens the door.  A mechanized stepladder unfolds from
               the doorsill]  Hmm.  Well, that's a nice feature.  [gets
               in]
               Not much headroom, though.  [the sunroof opens, allowing
               her hair to spring out]  Ooh!  Well, I guess I can drive
               it for a little while.
               [the patter of little feet is heard, and then the kids
               jump into the back seat]
Lisa:          But mom, I read that sport-utility vehicles are more
               likely to be in fatal accidents.
Bart:          Fatal to the people in the other car.  Let's roll.
Marge:         Hang on, the manual says I need to log on to the onboard
               computer.  [enters "MARGE" on a keypad]  M-A-R-G-E.
Computer:      Hello, Marge.  Where would you like to go today.
Marge:         No one has ever asked me that before in my life.
-- Must not be a Windows user, then, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% On the way home from the grocery store, Marge marvels at the
% Canyonero's ability to haul a prodigious amount of food.
% Unfortunately, gridlock has stranded Marge and the groceries on the
% highway.  Even though the house is in sight, they can't get to it.
% Bart occupies his time constructively, if you consider tormenting his
% sister with whipped cream to be constructive.
%
% Bart does a little back-seat driving.

Bart:     C'mon, Mom, just cut across the field.
Marge:    Oh, I don't know.  Doesn't seem right.
Bart:     Do you want to spend your whole life doing what's right?
Marge:    Of course not.  [sees the "4X4" button blinking enticingly]
          Let's do it.
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% With the Canyonero jingle playing in the background, Marge engages
% the four-wheel drive, signals her turn, and cuts across the field,
% scattering wildlife left and right.  "You the man, Mom," Bart says,
% wowed.  Singing along with the Canyonero theme, Marge pulls up to the
% house.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time:  8:32]
%
% Bart's in the kitchen, wearing only his underwear.  Feeling a little
% underdressed, he slips on a thawed whole chicken (!) and becomes Baron
% von Chickenpants.  Lisa isn't so much impressed as grossed out.  She
% tries to get Marge in to settle the matter, but she's preoccupied with
% washing her truck.
%
% Meanwhile, Homer's snacking routine is disrupted by a rare find -- a
% three-chambered peanut.  He calls for her to come see what "he" did,
% but she doesn't respond.  Homer goes looking for her, and finds her in
% the driveway, attaching some auxiliary lights to the Canyonero.

Homer:    Marge, you've been out there all morning.
Marge:    So?
Homer:    So?  Lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if
          you aren't around to see it.
Marge:    Oh, I'll come watch you do nothing after I try out my new
          high-intensity halogen headlights.
          [turns on the headlights.  The beams are strong enough to
          pierce the kitchen wall, allowing us to see that Lisa has
          Bart in a headlock.  Startled by the light, she runs off.
          Marge chuckles]
          Nobody will ever cut me off again.
Homer:    Aw, please come in.  Maggie smells bad and the cat wants
          something, but I don't know what.
          [Snowball II taps her food dish against the door jamb]
Marge:    I'm almost done -- and tell Bart to get out of my purse.
          [cut to the view of the kitchen from outdoors.  Bart is
          rummaging through Marge's purse.  Homer comes in and says
          something to him, although we cannot hear it.  Bart shrugs,
          and then the two of them resume their rummaging]
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Joining the SUV set has certainly had its effect on Marge.  Once
% reluctant to change lanes, she now bobs and weaves through traffic,
% keeping a running commentary on the incompetent drivers surrounding
% her.

Oh, for God's sake -- go back to New Jersey!
-- Marge Simpson, defensive driver, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Even a funeral procession doesn't slow Marge down.

Marge:      Come on, come on, get that corpse off the road!  The
            streets are for the living!
            [drives up on the sidewalk, and past the procession]
Lovejoy:    [from his car]  Slow down, you maniac!  Show some respect
            for coffin full of bricks representing a young man lost at
            sea.
-- No respect for the, er, heavy, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% It isn't long before Marge's aggressive driving attracts the
% attention of the local police.  Chief Wiggum pulls her over.

Marge:    [rolls down the window] This better be important.
Wiggum:   Can the sweet talk, Thelma and Louise.  You have a serious
          mental illness.  The technical term is, "road rage."  [writes
          up a ticket] I'll see you tomorrow at traffic school, speedy.
          [hands ticket to Marge] You've got exactly five seconds to
          get out of my sight.
          [Marge rolls up window and drives off]
          Why are the pretty ones always insane?
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% The next day Marge and her fellow road warriors are at traffic
% school, sitting in a small classroom.  Wiggum walks to the front of
% the room and addresses the students.

Okay, I assume you all know why you're here.  [ducks a chair thrown at
him from offscreen] That's right, you're all angry, sick people.  But,
over these next eight hours, you will be broken down to the level of
infants, then rebuilt as functional members of society, then broken
down again, then lunch, then, if there's time, rebuilt once more.
-- Chief Wiggum, introducing a traffic safety class, "Screaming Yellow
   Honkers"

% Wiggum has Lou run the traffic school film, "Road Rage:  Death Flips
% the finger."  The film opens with a police officer standing next
% chalkboard set up by a busy road.

Sgt. Crew:     Hello, I'm Sgt. Crew, and I'm here to talk to you about
               [says the next two words slowly, while writing them on
               the board] Road Rage.
Kearney:       [in the classroom] Duh.
Agnes:         Quiet, fatso, the sergeant's talking.  [to the film]  Go
               on, dear.
Sgt. Crew:     In, these modern hectic days of fast food, answering
               machines and one-night stands, people are getting
               angrier.  Now, what you're about to see is not pretty.
               [cut to a man driving a pickup truck.  A car cuts him
               off]
Man:           Cut me off, willya?  [throws his lunchbox.  Not
               satisfied, he tears off his rear-view mirror and throws
               that]
               [cut to a women driving while applying lipstick.  A horn
               honks]
Woman:         Learn to drive, dimwit!
               [cut to a man in judicial robes driving a car]
Judge:         [banging gavel on dashboard]  I sentence you to kiss my
               ass!
               [cut to a man wearing what appears to be a space suit,
               leaning out the side of his car while he drives.  He
               waves a golf club and makes a war cry]

               people at once.  Sgt. Crew reappears in a square in the
               middle]
Sgt. Crew:     Look familiar?  It should.  Anger is what makes America
               great.  [switch to a full-screen shot of Crew] But you
               must find a proper outlet for your rage.  Fire a weapon
               at your television screen.  Pick a fight with someone
               weaker than you.  Or, write a threatening letter to a
               celebrity.  So when you go out for a drive, remember to
               leave your murderous anger where it belongs -- at home.

               "END", respectively, punch through]
-- The rules of the road, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% The lights come up after the film ends.

Wiggum:   And as if that wasn't enough, we have a special guest -- why,
          it's Curtis E. Bear, the courtesy bear.
          [Eddie, dresses as a bear, stands next to Wiggum]
          For the next three hours, this bear will take your verbal and
          physical abuse with good nature and aplomb.  So, if you'll
          all just grab one of these two-by-fours ... [indicates a pile
          of lumber]
Eddie:    Um, Chief?  Can I at least shield my crotch?
Wiggum:   Bears can't talk, Eddie.
          [switch to Eddie's point of view, through the bear suit's
          mouth.  The students move in for the kill.  Agnes knocks
          Curtis/Eddie over with one blow]
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% The class, film, herbal rinse, and opportunity to whale on a cop in a
% bear suit have left Marge a calm and peaceful woman.  Moe offers to
% help "Midge" work through whatever rage she may have remaining -- even
% if that means getting sexual.  Marge politely declines.
%
% Politeness seems to be catching.  Agnes and Kearney, who both have
% blocked Marge into her spot, each offer to let the other one leave
% first.  The courteous deadlock begins to grate on Marge.  When she
% sees that even Curtis E. Bear isn't willing to wait his turn to leave,
% Marge decides she's had enough.  She puts the Canyonero in gear and
% runs right over Agnes and Kearney's cars.
%
% When Marge leaves the parking lot, she's met by an oncoming vehicle.
% Veering right onto a side road, she flies over a speed bump and
% careens into the fence surrounding the jail.  The prisoners run out,
% shouting, "We're free!"

Snake:    Whoa-ho-ho!  Thanks, chick-dude.  [runs away]
Wiggum:   Well I hope you're happy, Simpson.  Those prisoners were one
          day away from being completely rehabilitated.  I'm tearing up
          your license.  [takes Marge's license and tries to rip it up]
          Aw, geez, darned laminated -- would you mind?  [hands license
          to Marge]  I've got stubby fingers.
Marge:    [Marge obligingly tears up her license]  Ohhh.
-- Busted, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  14:44]
%
% Marge bemoans her fate.

Marge:    I can't believe they took away my license.  It feels like I
          lost a limb.
Homer:    Well, that's a turn-off.
Lisa:     Hey, why don't you come to the wild animal park with us?
Marge:    Oh, you father drives like an old lady.
Homer:    At least I've got a license.
Marge:    Mmmm.  [glares at Homer]
Homer:    [sotto voce] Come on, kids, I went too far.  [hustles the
          kids out of the house]
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% And so the Simpsons (minus Marge and Maggie) enjoy a quiet day at the
% zoo.  Perhaps too quiet.

Bart:     Oh, what a gyp.  They're all just lying around.  [to animals]
          Do something!
Lisa:     Bart, they're not here to entertain us.
Homer:    I've seen plays that were more exciting than this.  Honest to
          God -- plays!
-- Well, let's not go overboard, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Homer is disappointed that the lemurs in their cage are napping.
% Lisa notes that the animals are nocturnal, but Homer is already
% swinging into action.  With Bart's slingshot, he takes aim at one of
% the lemurs and (despite Lisa's protest) fires a stone at its backside.
% The startled lemur runs around its cage, and bites a kangaroo on the
% tail.  The panicked kangaroo jumps over the fence into the rhino
% compound, hitting a rhino.  It runs toward the rest of the heard,
% starting a stampede.  The startled rhinos trample down the gate and
% escape into the zoo.
%
% Surveying the chain reaction that he started, Homer hands the
% slingshot to Lisa, and they run off.
%
% A zookeeper drives up in his jeep.

I told them a chain-link fence wouldn't hold rhinos.  No, wait, no I
didn't -- I meant to tell them.
-- Zookeeper, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% The zookeeper picks up a rifle and loads a tranquilizer dart.  He
% fires at one of the rhinos, but the dart bounces off the animal,
% ricochets off Homer's rear end, and hits a sloth.  It does a happy
% little dance and then falls soundly asleep.
%
% Frightened zoo patrons, Homer and the kids among them, run out into
% the parking lot.

Homer:    Don't worry kids, I know just what to do.  [faces the rhinos]
          Jumanji!
          [the rhinos keep charging.  Homer starts running again]
          Does anything from the movies actually work?
-- Evidently not, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Wiggum's patrol car is on the scene, but the rhinos quickly overturn
% and trample it.  Wiggum, Eddie, and Lou watch from behind a rock.

Wiggum:   Aw, nuts.  Isn't there anybody who can round up these thunder
          lizards?
Lou:      Well, they'd need a pretty rugged vehicle.
Eddie:    And a heart to match.
          [Wiggum thinks for a minute, and the scene shifts to the
          Simpson house, where Marge stands in the doorway.  The cops
          have come to pay her a visit]
Marge:    I'd like to help you, Chief, but my license was revoked.
          Seems I'm full of rage.
Wiggum:   [cradles his hat in his arm, and strokes it]  Then do it for
          this adorable little puppy.  Look at the puppy, Marge.
Marge:    That's your hat.
Lou:      Eh, she's good, Chief.
Marge:    Now if you'll excuse me, I have some dust that needs busting.
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Marge goes inside and starts to vacuum.  Kent Brockman is on TV,
% reporting from the zoo as people run around behind him.

Kent:     This is Kent Brockman at the scene of a level three rhino
          alert.  Authorities say there's no immediate danger to
          anyone, except those three luckless people [points to Homer,
          Bart, and Lisa, who are trapped on the roof of their car]
          whom we'll identify as soon as the rhinos spit out their
          wallets.
Marge:    [gasps in horror]
          [cut "live" to the scene]
Homer:    [throwing his popcorn at the rhinos]  Back!  Back, I say!
          Oh, no, I'm out of popcorn!
Lisa:     Throw your peanuts!
Homer:    You throw *your* peanuts.
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% The rhinos begin rocking the car.  Just then, the cavalry, or rather
% Marge, rides to the rescue.  Driving the Canyonero, she rounds up the
% rhinos, and corrals them into the zoo.  Wiggum latches a flimsy lock
% and declares, "This oughta hold 'em."
%
% The story isn't over yet.  It seems Marge overlooked one of the
% rhinos, which is threatening Homer and the kids.  Marge quickly drives
% over.

Marge:    [driving up and honking] Get in!  Get in!
          [the kids do so, jumping through the open sunroof and landing
          in the back seat]
          Come on, Homer, jump!
          [he tries, but gets stuck in the sunroof]
Homer:    Oh, when will Detroit build a sunroof for the husky
          gentleman?
-- Right after they build another Powell motorcar, "Screaming Yellow
   Honkers"

% With the rhino approaching, Marge has no choice but to gun it.
% Unfortunately, the quick start dislodges Homer from the sunroof, and
% he tumbles into the parking lot.  The rhino picks him up by slipping
% his horn underneath Homer's belt, and lifting.  The beast carries
% Homer off the zoo grounds, past Moe's Tavern, and over to a
% construction pit.
%
% Homer's belt breaks as the rhino swings him around, and he lands in a
% Porta-John.  The door closes behind him, and he takes a moment to
% thank God and Porta-John.  The respite is short-lived.  The rhino
% spears the Porta-John repeatedly, the menacing horn easily ripping
% through the side walls.

I'm gonna die!  [claps hands in prayer] Jesus, Allah, Buddha -- I love
you all!
-- Homer Simpson, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Marge has followed Homer to the construction site.  The rhino begins
% to charge the Porta-John.  Through one of the holes ripped in the
% wall, Homer can see Marge driving up in her Canyonero, but she's too
% far away beat the rhino to Homer.

Looks like it's time for plan B.  One ... two ... three ... B!
-- Marge Simpson, "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% Marge jumps out of the truck.  It rolls over and catches on fire.
% The rhino diverts from his course to stomp out the flames.

Marge:    [raps on the door of the Porta-John] It's okay, Homey.  You
          can come out now.
Homer:    [from inside] Uh, give me a minute.
          [his hand reaches out to grab some toilet paper, and takes it
          inside]
-- "Screaming Yellow Honkers"

% The police and the zookeeper arrive to throw a net over the escaped
% rhino.

Homer:         Oh Marge, you saved me!
Bart:          Wow, you are so much cooler than Milhouse's mom!
Wiggum:        Yeah, way to channel that rage, Simpson.
Lisa:          How'd you know your plan would work, Mom?
Marge:         Glad you asked, honey.  Well, I was watching "Dateline,"
               and Stone Phillips said SUVs always roll over when you
               turn sharply.  And the gas tanks explode at the drop of
               a hat.
Zookeeper:     And she also knew that if a rhino sees a flame, he'll
               instinctively try to put it out.
Marge:         Stone Phillips again.
Homer:         Is there anything that guy doesn't know?
Zookeeper:     Boy, that Stone Phillips sounds like quite a bloke.
               What television network is he on?
Bart:          Why, NBC, of course.
Lisa:          NBC has lots of great shows, and their news and sports
               coverage can't be beat.
Wiggum:        Do you think there's anything great on NBC right now?
Homer:         Oh, I'm sure of it.
Marge:         But there's only one way to find out.
               [cut to the closing credits]
Homer:         [voice-over]  I'd like to read the following statement,
               but I do so under ... [sound of gun cocking] ... my own
               free will.  It has come to my attention that NBC sucks.
               I apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as
               many Fox shows as possible.  So in summary, NBC -- bad.
               Fox -- good.  [sotto voce] CBS great.
               [sound of gunshot, followed by a thud.  The Gracie
               Studios logo appears, accompanied by three gunshots]
-- Don't touch that dial!  "Screaming Yellow Honkers"
