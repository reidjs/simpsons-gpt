===============================================================================
Blackboard :- I am not certified to remove asbestos.
              I am not certified to remove asb/ at cutoff.

Lisa's Solo:- None due to shortened intro.

===============================================================================
> Did you notice...
===============================================================================
    ... the Spanish bee's name is "Pedro"?
    ... Martin's underwear also changes colors in the rain?

Tony Hill:
    ... the teenager is Lunch Lady Doris's son?
    ... Bart wears something other than his regular "uniform" this
        episode...the green-striped sweater?
    ... Hans Moleman works for BurnsoDyne?
    ... Barney's has ten lanes?  And a coffee shop?
    ... it takes Smithers two kicks to level the pins?
    ... SES begins classes at 8:00 am?
    ... Bart's socks' colors run (but no one else's do)?
    ... the grabber game has glass panels?
    ... Burns Manor has a dome?

John Murray:
    ... the Bongo comics return box in the comic store?
    ... Skinner buys his mom dresses from Mr. Boys?
    ... when Lisa is modeling the uniforms her saxophone looks as though
        it's made of pink plastic?
    ... Spanish Bee now works for channel Six, or at least plays on
        their bowling team?

Don Del Grande:
    ... in the opening, human Maggie sucks her pacifier, and mouse
        Maggie twitches her nose?
    ... Principal Skinner spent three years as a POW in North Vietnam?
    ... Homer bowls right-handed?
    ... while Homer is coming up with the idea of a team, all of the
        bowlers in the background throw nothing but strikes?
    ... with the exception of Otto's 7-10 split and Mr. Burns, everybody
        who bowls gets a strike?
    ... when the uniformed kids march to class, each line alternates
        boy-girl-boy-girl?
    ... when Burns bowls his last ball, one foot appears to be on the
        line?  (If it's just barely touching the line, it's probably not
        far enough over the line to trigger the foul light; however,
        American Bowling Congress rules state that touching the line is
        a foul.)
    ... the trophy appears to be a "perpetual" trophy (there's room to
        put more than one team on there), so Burns doesn't get to keep
        it, at least not for more than one year?

        have spiky hair)?
    ... the Maggie-mouse, in lieu of a pacifier, makes squeaky noises?
    ... the Hideo Nomo poster near the Bongo comics returns box?
    ... Homer is taking it upon himself to foot the entire $500 entry
        fee, rather than having each member pitch in $125?
    ... Springfield Elementary's girl uniforms are provided by "Mr. Boy
        for Girls?"
    ... the Homewreckers league is comprised of four people who have
        spelled trouble for the Simpsons' marriage: Mindy Simmons,
        Lurleen Lumpkin, Shauna Tifton (a.k.a.  Princess Khasmir), and
        Jacques?
    ... Captain McAllister's bowling shirt reads simply, "Cap'n?"
    ... when Homer tosses his ball aside, it hits someone?

Ricardo Lafaurie:
    ... this is the _third_ reference to Lucky Charms?  [What's so bad
        about tasteless oats and imitation marshmallows?]

        Pillsbury food?

        frisbee?
    ... the fake Oscar nearly anagrams into Doris Grau?
    ... this episode was in loving memory of Doris Grau?  (see below)

Jose Lafaurie:
    ... Burns is stronger than in previous episodes?
    ... the Pin Pals walk in with their bowling shoes already on before
        the championship game?

Bob Yantosca:
    ... Homer refers to Bart & Lisa as "my weiner kids?"
    ... Homer stole the Oscar statue belonging to Dr. Haing S. Ngor
        (Best Supporting Actor, "The Killing Fields", 1984)?  (see
        below)
    ... Homer doesn't admit that he's the one who breaks the toilet?

Ondre Lombard:
    ... Bart and Milhouse assume the most obvious answer to the MAD
        Fold-in caption?
    ... Moe has a light switch to his outdoor sign?

Frederic Briere:
    ... Ned doesn't consider God's help as cheating?
    ... either Burns' computer has voice control capabilities (like all
        Star Trek series), or it's been pre-programmed to perform
        analysis on every employee's resemblance with "Poppin Fresh"
        (sp?) on the push of a single button?
    ... the Lovejoys are considered holy, despite their attitude towards
        their religion?  ("Have you ever _read_ this thing?")
    ... Burns' strength increases throughout the episode?  At the start,
        he's barely able to lift a ball, but at the end he can hold it
        securely.

Robert Holland:
    ... Smithers' disapproving look as Homer swats Burns' butt in joy
        over their victory?

There is an issue of "Punch" in the comic book store, but the last issue
of "Punch" was April 8, 1992.  (And, unlike most other magazines which
cease publication (for example, the first run of "Games"), because they
went bankrupt, "Punch" refunded all outstanding subscription balances.)

According to Homer, Barney has a mistress, but he's not married, so who
is he cheating on?  {ddg}

The pin lights that light up when Homer has his idea are only seen in
that closeup.  {mr}

Nelson usually sits in the back of the classroom.  {dh}

When Bart's class erupts, Ralph is in there eating paste, even though
he's in Lisa's class instead of Bart's.  {ddg}

Missy gets out of her desk and in the same shot, Missy runs in front of
the classroom.  {rl}

Chalmers doesn't have a pen in his pocket until he needs it.  {dh}

Chalmers falls before the mob of kids reaches him.  Also, he falls
backwards, yet he is on his stomach while the kids trample him.  {dh}

When Principal Skinner pulls Bart out of the crowd in the hallway,
Milhouse and Nelson run by them twice.  {ddg}

A fire place "magically" appears in view from Burns office door.  {dh}

Chesperito, once again, has switched allegiances.  In 9F19 he works for
channel Ocho, switches to channel Six in 1F11, then back to channel Ocho
in 3F08.  Now he's at channel Six again.

Homer and his teammates' bowling bags all appear in the same color in
one scene.  {dh}

The beer bottle caps only appear when Homer and his team mates needed
them.  {dh}

What alley would serve beer without prepayment?  {th}

Skinner silently motions for the uniforms to be brought into the
auditorium, but Willy shouldn't have been able to see this because the
auditorium doors don't have windows.  {dh}

One of Patty and Selma's teammates disappears after their match with The
Pin Pals.  Also, Patty's beer magically appears in her hand.  {dh}

The fourth bowler in the Home Wreckers was not Mindy in all shots but
the shot of them walking away.  {rl}

Why would Rev. Lovejoy want to spend his leisure hours with Ned?  In all
previous episodes, he's actively avoided him.  {dh2}

Bart is taller than usual relative to Lisa in the kitchen scene.  {th}

Why should Marge wonder where Bart picked up "suck" if she knows that he
introduced it to Milhouse in 8F04?  {rl}

Janey shows up three times in the line of kids filing past Skinner.
{dh2}

Krabappel calls the front wall the back wall.  (But then the two walls
are probably parallel anyway.)  {th}

The alley seems to have more lanes when Snake "bowls."  {th} [Dave Hall
counts 21 - ed]

Eddie and Lou's pockets appear on the wrong side of their chests after
Snake escapes.  {dh}

The Home Wreckers don't have name tags when we first see them.  {dh}

Shouldn't Homer's "B Sharps" Grammy be in the trophy rack?  {dh2}

In the first scene of the kids marching to class, Principal Skinner and
Lunch Lady Doris are standing at a corner, but in the next scene, they
are directly in front of a set of lockers.  {ddg}

When Lisa, Rod and Milhouse play tag, the sky is bright and blue with
white clouds.  But when Skinner and Chalmers walk through the
schoolyard, suddenly, it becomes gray-clouded and dark blue.  {ol}

When the uniforms change color, everybody's socks are purple except for
Bart (multi-colored) and Martin (white), but later all of the boys
except Bart have white socks.  {ddg}

Burns and Smithers don't have the team uniforms until they need to
present them to Homer, Apu and Moe.  {dh}

There's never been a ditch around Burns' mansion before.  {dh2}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Tony Hill: A superb episode!  Classic Bart and Bonehead Homer humor come
    together in a fabulous combination.  Plus, we see the greatest
    number of return cameos by one-shot characters in OFF history.
    Isn't it fitting that Doris Grau got such a meaty part in the first
    episode after she died?  I give TH an A!

John Murray: The episode, while not great, still managed to have some
    great scenes.  The school uniform plot seemed weak, but you can't go
    wrong with lunch lady Doris.  Mr. Burns bowling made up for it, also
    the recurring jokes added a lot to this episode.  You can't go wrong
    with Hans and death (by drill no less).  Grade: B-.

Haynes Lee: A fairly good episode which go watered down by by having two
    major unconnected plots in the same episode.  Grade: B-.

Don Del Grande: B - it's a good episode, with the occasional laugh (the
    last scene sticks out), but nothing worth shouting about.  Also, the
    uniform story didn't really go anywhere.

Dave Kathman: Eh.  Some good jokes, but it just didn't grab me.  The
    whole thing with Burns joining the team was inexplicable, though the
    writers obviously were aware of that.  The school uniform subplot
    was mildly amusing, but it would have been nice if they could have
    tied the two plots together somehow.

Scott Fujimoto: A pretty flat episode that brought up bad memories of
    the 6th season, although it improved toward the end.  There were a
    few laughs here and there, and the different team "themes" was
    amusing.  Burns was completely out of character, but the writers
    acknowledged as much at the end.  Grade: C+.

Benjamin Robinson: Rolls a 7-10 split in the first act, but eventually
    recovers to pick up the spare.  Hampered a little by silly subplot,
    and some people may object to Burns' sudden good demeanor for much
    of the episode.  Large numbers of clever little jokes save it,
    though.  (B+)

Jason Hancock: This episode was one of the best of this season.
    Sometimes I wonder if Burns was actually "boweling" instead of
    "bowling" -- not that it really mattered in the end.  I was a bit
    disappointed that we couldn't see what happened to Skinner's mom's
    dress.  Still, Doris Grau couldn't have been honored in any better
    way.  Grade: A-

Ricardo Lafaurie: All I can say is Burns was "too nice!"  Any other
    feelings are blindsided by the death of Doris Grau, so I'm not
    pouting.  I'm mourning.

Bob Yantosca: A somewhat mediocre episode with a couple of good gags.  I
    was ROTFL when the etherized Burns thought that Homer was Poppin'
    Fresh, and when Chalmers is just about to give Skinner a good report
    but has something bad happen to him at the last minute.  But the
    rest of the show seemed a bit contrived.  Grade: B-.

Rick Diamant: Well, that was less than their best.  Still, it had one of
    the funniest Simpsons lines of all time, which automatically bumps
    it up one full grade, up to a B. "So, who's ready to kick some
    Christian keister?"

Adam Lipkin: All in all not a bad episode.  The uniform subplot didn't
    really go anywhere.  The bowling plot was believable.  You gotta
    love Burns' unpredictable mood swings.  A bunch of great lines, like
    "That's leprosy for you," from CMB.  A B grade from me for this one.

Chris Courtois: This was a middle-of-the-road so-so episode.  They've
    done worse, but they've also done better.  Some good laughs, some
    really good meta-humor involving the competing teams.  The school
    uniform subplot didn't really go anywhere.  A perfectly average C.

Ondre Lombard: Overall grade: C+.  The plot was interesting, but some of
    the jokes were flat.  The only unpredictable thing about this
    episode was how the uniform idea was ruined.  Homer at times was a
    little too stupid, but tolerable.  Great characterization of Mr.
    Burns however.

Yours truly: I suddenly understood the episode when I saw the first
    credit: David Mirkin, Executive Producer.  A good Mirkin-esque
    episode with lots of cheap laughs, but no real emphasis on plot
    direction or realism.  For a Mirkin-style episode, an A-; compared
    to other episodes, C.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> George Bush's opinion of this episode

Dean Scungio quotes George Bush in the 5-Feb-96 issue of "US News and
    World Report" regarding this episode: "The only thing missing was
    Oliver Stone as the director."

>> "Mad" magazine jokes

Haynes Lee says the following:

    - "There was an `Almighty Dollar' fold-in.  I don't recall which
      issue though.
    - `Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions' was written Al Jaffe who also
      did the fold-ins.
    - The cartoon opposite fold in is a Spy versus Spy.
    - I never recalled Mad magazine having iron-on inserts.  MAD
      specials either have posters, stickers, plastic records, or stamps
      (and once a voodoo doll).
    - MAD magazine has four `specials' a year, but it seems like
      seventeen.
    - Spiro Agnew was Richard Nixon's Vice President who was the only
      politician scummier than Nixon himself."

>> "Spanish Flea"

While Martin and Lisa are modeling the new uniforms, Doris talks over a
    record playing "Spanish Flea".  Tony Hill writes, "`Spanish Flea' by
    Julius Wechter was a hit in 1965 for Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass
    on their album `Going Places.'"

>> Dr. Haing S. Ngor

Dave Kathman says, "Dr. Haing S. Ngor is a real doctor, a refugee from
    Cambodia who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his first
    movie role, `The Killing Fields', in 1984.  He's since appeared in
    some other things, such as Oliver Stone's `Heaven and Earth', but
    nothing too major."

>> "Release the hounds!"

Haynes Lee enumerates the episodes where hounds have been released:

    - [7G04] Burns warns company picnic to clear out because the hounds
      are going to released in ten minutes.
    - [7F10] Burns asks Smithers to release hounds on Homer and Marge
      when he decides to reject their settlement.
    - [7F07] Burns releases hounds on Bart when he tries to steal pie
      from windowsill.
    - [8F17] Burns releases hounds on Flanders when he solicits him
      about recycling.
    - [8F17] Burns releases hounds on Bart when Smithers reports a sweet
      little boy is ringing the doorbell.
    - [2F03] Evil Flanders releases hounds on Homer when he refuses to
      get a lobotomy.  {cg}
    - [3F10] Homer gets mauled by the hounds when he takes back the
      bowling trophy Burns kept for himself.

>> "In Loving Memory of Doris Grau"

Don Del Grande notes that Doris Grau "died of respiratory failure on
    December 30 at age 71 For those of you who don't know, Doris was the
    voice of Lunch Lady Doris, as well as Doris the hairdresser on `The
    Critic'.  Originally, she was the `script girl supervisor' on a
    number of series, including `The Tracey Ullman Show' (she also made
    a couple of appearances in sketches) and the first few seasons of
    `The Simpsons'.
    
    In the words of Doris the Hairdresser (from `The Critic'): `I know a
    few tricks about hair and teeth.  Always wear hair.  Always wear
    teeth.'"

>> Where is Springfield?

Tony Hill says Springfield "appears to be in one of the states where
    dress codes are legal.  The states have split about 50-50 (er,
    25-25) on this issue as the Supreme Court has never addressed the
    question.  I used to have a list of which states are which."

       Marge, someone broke the toilet!
-- Oscar vs. bowling trophy, "Team Homer"

% At the bowling lanes, Homer, Moe, and Apu prepare their balls.  The
% Holy Rollers walk in in monk's garb, their hoods drawn.  They lower
% their hoods and look to the heavens as light bathes them.

  Moe: Don't worry about nothing, Homer.  I have a feeling that Mr.
       Burns is going to have a little accident that might keep him from
       bowling with us tonight, heh heh heh.
Burns: [walking in, leaning on Smithers] Smithers, I'm afraid I won't be
       able to play tonight.  My old gimpy knee has gone akimbo again.
  Moe: [masked, with a cane] Take that!
        [bashes Burns on the leg with a cane, runs off]
Burns: Ooh!  Smithers...that precision assault popped it back into
       place.  Thank you, masked stranger!
-- Tonya Harding's bodyguard, he ain't, "Team Homer"

  Moe: D'oh, he's going to ruin everything!  All right, that's it,
       Homer: either Burns goes, or Moe goes.
  Apu: Yes, I am afraid that I am going to have to make a similar threat
       with my name in place of Moe's name.
Burns: So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister?
Homer: Oh, uh...Mr. Burns?  As team captain, it's my duty to inform you
       that --
Burns: Oh, I almost forgot.  I brought you all a little something.
        [pulls out a professionally-designed Pin Pals T-shirt]
  Moe: Aw, would you look at that?  "Pin Pals".
  Apu: At last, I finally have a garment fine enough to be married in.
Burns: I've always been wealthy, but this is the first time I ever
       felt...rich.
Homer: [sobs] Aw.
Burns: Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me.
Homer: [pause] You're off the team.
Burns: I -- what?
  Moe: [awkward laugh] He's just ribbing you, Monty.
        [Apu agrees; they all laugh]
-- How quickly they forget, "Team Homer"

% Mr. Burns tosses a ball weakly down the lane while Ned, Maude, Helen,
% and Timothy all bowl strikes.  "Yay!" cheers Ned.  "Hallelujah,"
% intones Timothy.  Burns' ball rolls into the gutter as his team
% groans.
%
% From behind the pins, we see them all scatter as Apu stands at the
% other end.  The nest shot shows Moe standing at the other end.  The
% next shot shows Burns standing at the other end.  He stands aside and
% says, "Nice one, Homer."  Homer thanks him.
%
% Homer rolls another strike.  Apu notes, "OK, the Holy Rollers are
% ahead by one pin and we only have one bowler left: Mr. Burns."  Mr.
% Burns walks to get a ball and his fingers flap in the wind from the
% ball return.  His team sighs as he winds up and delivers a weak ball
% that rolls straight into the gutter.  "Well, next time, a few steps
% more toward center, don't you think?" he asks jovially.  "Goodbye,
% trophy," Homer says to the gleaming trophy.
%
% Burns' second shot teeters on the edge of the gutter.  Otto, at the
% game machine, has latched onto a screw without realizing it.  "Whoa,
% whatever I got a hold of, it's _big_!"  The ball rolls on the edge and
% glances off two pins, making them wobble.  Otto, with a final grunt,
% dislodges the screw, pulling the leg of the machine and toppling it.
% The vibration causes the two pins to fall.  "Yes!" cheer Burns'
% teammates.  "Excellent," says Burns.  Otto looks down at the prizes,
% grabs the lobster harmonica, and cries, "Yes!"

Homer: Woo hoo!  We won!  We won!
        [Homer, Apu, and Moe dance while the kid gets the trophy from
       the case]
        [Homer holds it, but Burns takes it]
Burns: You mean, _I_ won.
  Apu: But we were a team, Sir.
Burns: Oh, I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart.
       You see, teamwork will only take you so far.  Then, the truly
       evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory.  Now, I
       must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll
       after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win
       the title.  Ta!
        [walks off with Smithers]
Homer: I guess some people never change.  Or, they quickly change and
       then quickly change back.
  Moe: You know what?  We don't need him, or his trophy!  We got each
       other, huh?
        [general murmurs of agreement]
-- The only ship worth a damn, "Team Homer"

% Homer's three former teammates stand outside the gates of Burns'
% compound and cheer Homer on.  "Go, Homer!  You're our man.  If you
% can't do it, no one can!"  Homer smashes a window at Burns' place and
% grabs the trophy, setting off the alarm and releasing the hounds.  He
% makes a dash for the gate, but doesn't make it over in time.  The dogs
% tear him to shreds as Otto remarks, "Well, I guess no one can."  Moe
% cries, "Run before they're through feeding!"  They do so as Homer
% continues to be torn apart.
