> Didja notice...
===============================================================================
    ... Krusty's dad was voiced by Jackie Mason?  (Pay attention to the
        deli menu.)  And of course, Jackie Mason is a prominent Jewish
        comedian, who has often been criticized as being ``too Jewish''.
        Indeed, Mason is himself a former rabbi! {jdb}
        Other voices were supplied by Doris Grau (the waitress), Pamela
	Hayden (Milhouse), and Tress MacNeille.
    ... Bart now has a phone in his room?
    ... Bart's stationery is titled, `From the brain of Bart'?
        (cf. `From the Noggin of Ned' in [7f08] and `From the mind
        of Marge' in [7f09].)
    ... Bart's collection of Krusty pencils was held in a coffee mug
        shaped like a nuclear cooling tower?  (References to [8f04]
        and [7f13].)  Bart also had a Krusty snow dome (a water-filled
        gizmo that you shake to make it look like it's snowing inside)
        on his desk.  Inside, Krusty is riding a unicycle. {elm}
    ... Krusty arrived at 6:10, and got off his unicycle at 6:15?
    ... Krusty dabs his eyes with a trick handkerchief?
    ... the TV ad for Barney's Bowl-a-Rama when Krusty cuts to a commercial?
    ... how the music repeated itself when Rabbi Krustofsky slammed the door
        each time?
    ... they were watching Krusty at Moe's Tavern?
    ... Maggie fell but once?  (When Marge answers the phone.)
    ... the special technical consultants in the credits?
        Rabbi Harold M. Schulweis and Rabbi Lavi Meier, Ph.D.

Did anybody see an `A-113' in the episode?  Brad Bird likes to hide that
number in things he directs.

Dave Hall {dh}:

    ... the "Applause" sign in the studio?
        The Krusty the Klown show is on at 4 o'clock weekdays.
        [I think this is according to the charts in the hallway, but Dave
        didn't say.  Note that the contradicts [7f23], in which Bart is
        watching the END of an I&S cartoon at 4pm.]
    ... at the dinner table...
        ... they'd already started dinner before saying Grace.
        ... the chairs all have a three-point crown at the top.
            (Those chair must be very unconformable as they have no backs.)
        ... Homer was scooping mash-potatoes onto his plate, but stopped once
            to take something out!
        ... After Krusty's story, the candles had burnt down.
    ... the `Concert for Bangladesh' tape sounded more like a record?
    ... Lisa's dresser has a little heart placed at the top of the mirror,
        and she has a phone in her bedroom?  (They used the phone to
        invite Rabbi Krustofsky and Krusty to Izzy's Deli.)
    ... the sink in Moe's Tavern appears to be over-flowing?
    ... the front door's peek-hole appears to be almost eye-level to Bart?
        [I bet Bart never uses it, though. --rjc]

Lawrence Alan Schwimmer {las} notes that at the end of the show, when they
all said goodbye to their audience, Krusty did not show traces of the pie
on his face.  [Maybe he wears teflon make-up?  --rjc]

Mario Dorion (mario@theglove.Canada.Sun.Com) points out that when Bart and
the Rabbi played chess, the board was not in a correct position, the
corners on the right side of each player was black instead of white.

Dave Hall {dh} reports:

The shoulder straps on Marge's apron turn into neck straps (which go
<under> the necklace) when she answers the phone.

Miss Pennycandy had barged in on Krusty's `Sex Chat'.  She also left the
door open, but during whole scene it's shown to be closed.

The monkey had no tail.

The large green chair (that Lisa fell asleep on) sometimes vanishes.

Throughout the whole dinner scene, glasses seem to move about, or switch
from either containing liquid to being empty, to disappearing and
reappearing.  (Even the bottle of wine seems to get magically, and
conveniently placed next to Krusty too.)

I couldn't see Lisa's legs under the table.

Krusty doesn't have a shirt pocket until he needs one to pull his
trick handkerchief out of.  Magic!

Did Chryslers have power steering and dynaflow suspension 40 years ago?
(Krusty says, ``We haven't seen each other in 25 years!'')

[David Moery {dm2} replies:  Chrysler introduced power steering on its
1951 model year cars.  Dynaflow refers to Buick's automatic transmissions
of the same era, and does not refer to suspension.]

Krusty came in a car, yet when he left there was no car seen around the
Simpson house, nor did Krusty take his coat and bag with him.  Next scene
shows him wearing a raincoat.  (Or did the monkey drive Krusty's car home?)

It's really pouring cats and dogs, yet the sky depicts cumulus clouds,
something you usually don't see in downpours.

Before Krusty's story, Krusty worn a blue bow-tie, but after the story (for
a brief moment), it turned green (as well as his hair).

The waitress's necklace seem to have grow slightly larger during one scene.
Moreover, the waitress that served Bart, Lisa, Krusty, and Rabbi
Krustofsky wasn't the same waitress that began the Deli scene.

> Handy reference guide to the episode
===============================================================================
Profuse thanks to Andrew Tannenbaum {trb} for the following information.
In this section, `I' refers to Mr. Tannenbaum.

>> The blessing

The Hebrew blessing before the meal went as follows:

Baruch atah adonai,             Blessed are you Lord,
eloheinu, melech ha'olam,       our God, king of the universe,
hamotzi lechem min ha'aretz     who brings forth bread from the earth.

(The `ch' sound is in `loch ness' not as in `watch.')

This is the standard blessing before a full meal, which in Judaism,
is one that includes bread.  There are other blessings for particular
types of food, but if you eat bread at the meal, this blessing covers
all the food at the meal.  There is a much longer blessing after the
meal, which wasn't shown.

Krusty goes on to talk about the `bracha', meaning the blessing.

>> A lexicon

nosh.  [Yiddish, rhymes with wash]  snack.

zetz.  [Yiddish]  smack, like when a parent disciplines a child.

yeshiva.  [Hebrew]  Jewish parochial school.
                           _                        _
talmud.  [Hebrew, from talmudh `instruction', from lamadh `to learn']
         the most important Jewish commentary on the bible.
         The Babylonian Talmud was mentioned; the Jerusalem
         Talmud also exists.

talmudic.  pertaining to the talmud, or to biblical study.

Oy gevald!  [Yiddish]  for heaven's sake!
        (literally, ``gevald'' means ``violence'' in Yiddish)

Oy vei is mir.  [Yiddish]  Oh, woe is me.

pisher.  [Yiddish?]  derogatory or belittling term, literally,
         pisser (one who urinates).

mishegoyim.  [Yiddish?]  crazy people

boychik.  [Russian/Yiddish]  diminutive form of English boy

[Also,

 bris.  Ritual circumcision ceremony.]

>> Other observations

They went to a talmudic conference in the Catskills (that is a resort
north of New York City, which frequented by Jews in those days).  [Theron
Stanford {tws} adds that many Jewish entertainers got their start
performing in the Catskills.]

When the Rabbi first picks up the phone, there are 5 Hebrew letters on the
wall behind him, but I didn't recognize the word.  [Audrey Rosen {ar}
thinks it might have been `Shalom'.]

When Bart went into the Rabbi's study the first time, I think the Hebrew
letters were largely random, but the Rabbi read it, saying, ``mumble
mumble, rebonno shel olom, yes, yes'' - which means ``mumble mumble,
master of the universe, yes, yes.''  ``Rebonno shel olom'' is a fairly
common form of address when Rabbis talk about God.

In the library, when Lisa and Bart are researching, there is a Hebrew book
lying on its side.  It says ``talmud'' on the spine, which is fine except
that books of the talmud rarely say that on the spine.  The talmud is made
up of many books, and the spine usually has the title of the volume.

Some of the names at the end by the chess table:

    Rabbi Hillel
    Judah the Pious
    Maimonides
    The Dead Sea Scrolls

>> Jewish entertainers
   Yes, Shatner <is> Jewish.  So is Nimoy, but that's not the point.
   Shatner is reported to have turned down a guest spot.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Krusty's dressing room door

Bill Baker {wab} reports:  ``Superimposed on the standard star on the
dressing room door is a likeness of Krusty.  The combination forms a
six-pointed Star of David.  Man, but do the animators cram this stuff in.''

>> Krusty's illiteracy

Krusty is known to have been illiterate in [7G12], and in [7F09] he held
Marge's angry letter upside-down.  In this episode, he appears to be
struggling to read Bart's letter, which shows that at least he's trying to
learn to read.  He didn't seem to have much difficulty reading `Sex Chat'.

On the other hand...

    - Krusty was first in his yeshiva class.  (Possibly exaggerated.)
    - Presumably, he passed his bar mitzvah which entails reading
      from the Torah.
    - He jotted down something when Bart called him about Izzy's Deli.

Ethan Miller {elm} suggests that perhaps Krusty can read Hebrew but not
English.  Andrew Tannenbaum {trb} agrees that this is a definite
possibility, especially since he grew up in a chassidic community.

>> Izzy's Diner

Not only does the Krusty the Klown sandwich consist entirely of pork
products, it is served with mayo on white bread.  Ethan Miller {elm}
points out that traditional Jewish deli fare is on rye with mustard
(corned beef, roast beef, pastrami, etc.).

There is some disagreement as to what was written on the menu.

Andrew Tannenbaum {trb} reads the Hebrew on the menu covers as ``XXX shel
eed, i.e., Jewish XXX, probably Jewish food or something like that.''

Ethan Miller {elm} reads it as ``XXX shel eer, which would mean
`<something> of the city'.  I can't really make out the first Hebrew word.
It looks like `hamazon', which means `food'.''

In private communication, Mr. Tannenbaum explained that the letters `d'
and `l' in Hebrew look very similar.

Stewart M. Clamen {smc} thought it read ``XXX shel eezee, that is,
XXX of Izzy, probably some word for deli.''

>> Fifty million Frenchmen can't be wrong

NAGORDON@amherst.edu notes that the sentence has been used to explain
Jerry Lewis' demigod status in France.  (The phrase began elsewhere, but
this is certainly the reference that was intended.)  Lawrence Alan
Schwimmer {las} points out that Jerry Lewis has indeed received the Legion
of Honor.

>> O Mein Papa

Audrey Rosen {ar} identifies the concluding song as ``Oh Mein Papa'', made
famous in the '50s by Eddie Fisher.  She also wonders what ever happened
to Krusty's ``Yiddishe Mama''?  There was a photo of Rabbi K. and his wife
on the Rabbi's desk, but no mention of the spouse...  [Maybe Joan Rivers
wasn't available? --rjc]

>> Miscellaneous

Kudos to the director for how Lisa said, ``Oh yeah!  It's all the kids
talk about on Monday at school.''  The combination of her facial expression
and hand gestures was hilarious.

Krusty thanks ``Miss Donna Mills (oh, she was a sport).''  This suggests
that Krusty abused her in some way or other (pie in the face?  seltzer
squirt?) but she took it with a smile.

% Krusty flashes back to his youth.

Man 1:   Should I finish college?
Rabbi K: Yes.  No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge.
Woman:   [babe in arms]  Rabbi, should I have another child?
Rabbi K: Yes.  Another child would be a blessing on your house.
Man 2:   Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler?
Rabbi K: Eh, couldn't you rephrase that as a, as an ethical question?
Man 2:   Um...  Is it right to buy a Chrysler?
Rabbi K: Oh, yes!  [chuckles]  For great is the car with power steering
         and dynaflow suspension!
-- It is written... ``Like Father, Like Clown''

% But Hyman Krustofsky forbids his son to be a clown.  The urge was too

% his father.  His father was not pleased.

Homer: Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.
Bart:  Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you.
Homer: Why you little! [strangles Bart]
-- ``Like Father, Like Clown''

% Lisa invites Krusty to continue.  ``My father tried to extinguish the
% comedy bug, but it was no use.''  The elder Krustofsky catches the younger
% with a seltzer bottle.  (``Oy gevald!'')  Then Krusty got his big chance,
% entertaining the Rabbis at a Talmudic conference in the Catskills.  His
% balloon sculptures of a Star of David and a Menorah are met with applause.

Rabbi K: You know that my son Herschel was first in his yeshiva class?
         As a matter of fact, he was voted `The most likely to hear God'.
Rabbi 2: Oh, go on, Hyman, you're exaggerating again, you're so proud of
         your son.
Rabbi K: A rabbi would never exaggerate!  A rabbi composes.  He creates
         thoughts.  He tells stories that may never have happened.
         But he does not exaggerate!
-- ``Like Father, Like Clown''

% But when a ``rowdy rabbi'' sprays Krusty with seltzer, his clown make-up

Oy vey's mir!  You have brought shame on our family!
Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive.
-- Rabbi Krustofsky to his son the clown, ``Like Father, Like Clown''

Rev. L:    I think so.
