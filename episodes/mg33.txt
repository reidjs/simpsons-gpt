M: Now, play friendly, children.

% Homer pushes the kids into the rumpus room.

B: We don't want to play friendly.
H: Bart!
L: We want to play rough!
H: Lisa!  Act like a lady.

% Homer slams the door.

L: Yeesh, what a grouch.

% Bart punches a floor-mounted punching bag.

L: Come on, Bart, you can punch better than that.
   Let me try.
B: But you're a mere girl.
L: And you're a sexist pig.  Gimme those gloves.

% Bart begins to hand them over, but Lisa snatches them.

L: Your problem is you're not motivated.

% Lisa draws Homer's face on the punching bag and starts punching with
% gusto.
%
% In the living room, Homer reclines on the couch while Marge knits.

H: Urgh.  [annoyed]  Do you hear that?
M: What, dear?
H: The punching bag.
M: They're just playing, Homer.
H: I can't sleep with that racket.  Go tell them to knock it off.
M: I like the punching bag sound.  You go tell them if you don't like it.
H: [threatening]  I said do it, now move it!

% Marge angrily gets up off the couch.  The punching doubles in intensity.
% Homer gets up and goes into the rumpus room...

H: Why you little...

% But the punching is coming from Marge.

H: Gasp!
M: Oh!
L: Uh oh.  Sorry, Dad.
B: Sorry, Dad.
A: *suck*  *suck*
M: Sorry, Homer.
B: Sorry, Homer.

% Bart steps in front of the bag.  Lisa stands behind it.

H: [threatening] Get out of the way, Bart.
B: But...
H: Step aside, boy...

% Lisa bites her knuckles in fear.

B: But...
H: Bart...

% Bart swallows hard and steps aside.  Lisa gasps and clutches the punching
% bag.

H: Let go, Lisa...

% She does so, and it springs forward, knocking Homer out.

H: D'oh!

% Homer lies face-down on the floor as the rest of the family look on,
% shocked.  Bart raises Lisa's arm, declaring her the champion.
