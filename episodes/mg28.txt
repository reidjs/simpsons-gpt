During Lisa's ``They don't like it, Dad'', the animators forgot to color
her eyelid.

Brian Howard {bh} gives the timing for this short as 1:07, whereas the
syndication package contains only 1:04 of animation.

This is the third time Homer has said, ``That's the last time I ever take
you kids to...''  The first two were the funeral [MG14] and the art
museum [MG29].
