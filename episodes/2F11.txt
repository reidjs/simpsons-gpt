The string Bart pulls on the weather balloon only appears when he pulls
it, and it's only tied to one side, yet things extend down from both
sides of the balloon.  {ddg}

When Skinner screams, twelve of his upper teeth are visible -- all of
them molars.  {ddg}

When Skinner throws his head back to yell "Nooo!!" the children can be
heard laughing, but those behind him aren't moving.  {mk}

Pierre-Jules-Cesar Janssen _discovered_ Helium, along with Joseph Norman
Lockyer; nobody _invented_ it.  {ddg}

Willy pulls the shotgun out of thin air.  {dh}

When Bart connects the generator to his rear wheel, the wheels turn in
place quickly; Bart may move slower than usual, but the wheels should
turn just as slow.  {ddg}

The American Flag should not be displayed at night unless lit by a
spotlight.  {mk}

The clouds are moving too quickly.  {dh}

There's no constellation called "The Chariot Race", unlike Orion the
Hunter and Cygnus the Swan.  {ddg}

Cygnus (the Swan) is not near Orion in the sky.  Orion is a winter
constellation, and Cygnus is visible in the spring.  {av}

When they show Orion, Betelgeuse and Rigel (the upper left and lower
right stars in the constellation) should be the brightest ones.  {av}

Skinner's cellular phone only has nine buttons.  {th}

The redialed phone number differs from the original number.

Why would Principal Skinner trust Bart with his cellular phone?  {mk}

If Bart first sees the comet going to one side, it shouldn't be headed
straight for Earth the next day, and it shouldn't be close enough to be
seen with the naked eye in broad daylight.  {ddg}

Nobody at the dinner table has a knife, yet there's some sort of sliced
meat on their plates.  {ddg}

Forks vanish from the table.  {dh}

Lisa isn't at the Super Friends table when it is first shown...and why
isn't Martin there?  {ddg}

Different camera angles show different positions for the students in the
school cafeteria.  {dh}

Email's bow tie changes color in one scene.  {dh}

A gambrel roof couldn't hold lawn chairs securely.  {th}

The Speaker of the House stands to preside; a flag hangs behind the
rostrum; there is no standing flag; and the members do not have desks.
{th}

Amendments to bills in Congress are voted _separately_ from the bill
being amended; they are not automatically attached.  {ddg}

They were trying to decide whom to throw out of the shelter because it
was stuffed too full for the door to be shut, but Flanders opened the
door to get out.  {vj}

When Marge first appears on the hilltop with Flanders, Maggie is nowhere
to be seen.  {ddg}

Springfield Elementary has a fallout bomb shelter in 9F18.  (At least
Skinner and Willy would have used it?)  {dh}

In a Tracy Ullman short, the Simpsons have a bomb shelter too.  {rc}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Tony Hill: It's another A!  I'm beginning to develop the theory that OFF
    thrives on implausibility.  Even the scientific goofs couldn't
    detract from the rich humor of this episode.  This had the most
    consistent plot of any recent episode.

Don Del Grande: A - second-best of the season, behind the Halloween
    Special.  John Swartzwelder finds the groove once again after a
    slightly lackluster "Itchy & Scratchy Land" and "Homer the Great".

Dave Hall: Nothing really bothered me about this episode -- it was
    awesome!  John Swartzwelder has another notch in my book of favorite
    writers.

Martin Crim: Tonight's episode was an embarrassment and a
    disappointment.  If I were trying to get a friend hooked on The
    Simpsons, I would never show them that episode.  The plot was
    extremely lame and contrived.  There were a couple funny moments,
    but that was all.

Joe Manfre: what the hell?  I seem to remember when Simpsons episodes
    had plots which related to rather than hopelessly contorting real
    life.  This continued in the recent trend of episodes being little
    more than jokes barely strung together by a thin, unbelievable plot.

Christine Tiplady: This episode was a KLUNKER.  No exploration of
    characters or real issues; just a wild premise.  The Simpsons is
    still one of the funniest shows going, but it takes more than that
    to make it the truly amazing show it usually is.

Martin Abela: Now this is more like it!  The comedy was there, but we
    also had some drama thrown in for good measure.  Good use of the
    ensemble cast (Flanders, Skinner).  Most of all: Homer actually
    shows some positive traits.  I am amongst those who feel he has been
    depicted as an idiot once to often.

Warren Hagey: I thought that this was a great episode from beginning to
    end.  The balloon and the fighter jets were great, as was "E-mail",
    ..., "Lisa".  The only scene that I found lacking in any major way
    was Bart's actual discovery of the comet.  A.

Aaron Varhola: A strong effort.  Not that funny, but a well-developed,
    compelling storyline, and the gags didn't detract from the plot;
    much like "Bart's Girlfriend".  The episode also showed more depth
    on repeated viewings; I liked it better the second and third time
    around.  B+.

David Sobecki: I never thought an episode of the Simpsons could be that
    bad.  I can honestly say it's the only one I've ever even considered
    saying it was into this one today.

John J. Wood: Grade: C+.  After a promising start (Bart's prank on
    Skinner), this episode treaded downhill fast.  Although a hard-to-
    fathom storyline was carried well, again most of the jokes were
    either flat, stale, or UNclever.

Jon Bigelow: This episode was only mildly amusing.  There were some good
    gags ("Firing Sidewinder missile", Moe: "Oh, dear God NO!"), but
    they were outnumbered by lame ones (superfriends).  Homer didn't
    have any good lines, either.  I'd give this one a "C".

Matthew Kurth: In some ways a remake of MG20, this one stands as one of
    the better "whacky object" stories.  Not particularly brilliant, but
    satisfying. 7.5/10.

Yours truly: Hmm, another weird one.  Can't say I found it
    sidesplittingly funny like other John S. episodes.  As always, had
    its moments: the fighter planes, notarized(!) photos, Frink and his
    models, and the wonderfully ironic list of gay people.  Grade: C.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Principal Kahoutek

Skinner refers to a Kahoutek who beat him to a phone to report a
    discovery.  Tony Hill notes, "The Kahoutek comet appeared in
    December 1973/January 1974 and was much less brilliant than its
    advance publicity."

>> Astronomy in this episode

Bob Yantosca goes into great detail: "Skinner's scope looked like a 60mm
    (2.4") refractor on an altitude-azimuth mount.  The eyepiece was
    seated in a `star diagonal' or prism, which bends the light path 90
    degrees, to avoid awkward viewing angles when pointing the telescope
    near the zenith.  As with all telescopes, the image should have been
    upside down.  The star diagonal will also cause an additional
    left/right inversion in the image.
    
    Right Ascension is essentially celestial longitude measured eastward
    from the Vernal Equinox (the point where the Celestial Equator
    crosses the Ecliptic, or the Sun's path on the sky).  Right
    Ascension is measured in sexagesimal hours, minutes, and seconds.
    Declination is celestial latitude, measured from the celestial
    equator (0 degrees) to the North and South Celestial Poles (+90, -90
    degrees, respectively).  The Celestial Equator and Poles are the
    extension into space of the Earth's Equator and Poles.  Declination
    is measured in sexagesimal degrees, minutes, and seconds.  And, for
    the record, 6 hours RA, 12 degrees Decl. is in the constellation of
    Orion.
    
    Skinner could not have read RA and Dec from his telescope's setting
    circles, as his scope was on an Altitude-Azimuth mount.  One's
    altitude and azimuth (direction from N) is not the same as one's
    latitude and longitude, after all!  Altitude and Azimuth are
    relative coordinates, as they depend on your position.  Latitude and
    longitude (or Right Ascension and Declination, if it's on the sky)
    are referenced to the celestial equator/poles so they are the same
    for all observers, regardless of position.  To read RA and Dec
    coordinates from a telescope, you must have an equatorial mount,
    where one axis is pointed towards the North (or South) Celestial
    Pole.  This also allows you to compensate for the Earth's rotation
    by moving the telescope about one axis only.
    
    Contrary to popular belief, astronomers at the big observatories do
    not look through the scopes directly.  Instead, electronic or
    photographic detectors are placed at the `eyepiece' end of the
    telescope.  In many cases spectra of the objects are obtained,
    rather than images.
    
    To officially report an astronomical discovery, Bart would have had
    to called, telexed, faxed, or emailed Brian Marsden at the Harvard
    Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, MA, not his local
    observatory.  Bart would have also had to show evidence of the
    comet's motion with respect to the `fixed' stars over a period of at
    least one night, preferably several nights.
    
    Beginning January 1, 1995, comets (in addition to being named after
    their discoverers) are designated as follows: the year of discovery,
    an upper-case letter identifying the half-month of discovery, and a
    consecutive number indicating the order of discovery in that half-
    month.  So if Bart's comet was the first comet discovered in the
    first half of February 1995, then it would be referred to as `Comet
    Simpson 1995 C1'.
    
    Comet tails typically point away from the Sun, regardless of which
    direction they are moving in.  Some comets have two tails, an ion
    tail, which is swept away from the Sun by the Solar Wind, and a
    dust/gas tail.
    
    Comets do not make a flaming noise.  Actually, they are very cold
    and consist mainly of dust and ice.  :-)
    
    Even if the comet burned up in the atmosphere, it would have still
    done some damage.  The shock wave and heat produced by the comet's
    passage through our atmosphere would probably have been intense
    enough to flatten stuff over a wide area.  This is probably what
    happened in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908, when miles of forest were
    flattened by a `fireball'."

Bill Higgins adds some notes of his own.  Skinner's first sighting, the
    balloon at 6-19-14-59, "is on a line between Gamma Gemini and Zeta
    Orionis, a triple star system."  Bart's comet at 4-12-8-7 "is in
    Taurus, close to Mu Taurii and 46 Taurii."

>> Super Friends

For non-North-American viewers, the Super Friends was a Hanna Barbera TV
    cartoon series from the late 70s and early 80s that had all the big-
    name superheroes (Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman) and a few others
    (the Wonder Twins, Aquaman, Green Lantern) fighting crime as a
    unified body.

>> Professor Frink and the Carter administration

Tony Hill writes, "The reference to the Carter Administration was
    probably a poke at that president's MX missile basing plan.  The
    idea was to build a huge rail system covering most of Nevada and
    Utah which connected many anti-ballistic missile silos, too many for
    the enemy to destroy in toto."

>> Que Sera, Sera

Tony Hill expounds, "`Whatever Will Be, Will Be,' also known as `Que
    Sera, Sera' was the Academy Award-winning best song of 1956.  It was
    written by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans and was introduced by Doris
    Day.  It was from the Hitchcock film `The Man Who Knew Too Much,'
    which was parodied by OFF last season."

Skinner: Yes, but you won't be looking through it: I forbid it, heh heh.

         three wise men.  [points to Curly, Larry, and Moe]
-- Wise at slapstick, maybe, "Bart's Comet"

   Bart: Who names these things [the constellations] anyway?
Skinner: Whoever discovers them.  I've been hoping I could find
         something that would be named after me.
   Bart: And you've never found anything?
Skinner: Once...but by the time I got to the phone, my discovery had
         already been reported by Principal Kahoutek...[a cloud covers
         the moon; scary music plays]
         I got back at him, though...him and that little _boy_ of his.
          [the music ends]
         Anyway, that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me.

Skinner: Now, this morning we're going to be mapping a small square of
         sky that's thought to be empty.  It's my hope that it's not.
   Bart: So what am I supposed to do exactly?
Skinner: Just write down my findings as I give them to you.  Six hours
         nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees twenty-two
         minutes declination: no sighting.
   Bart: [bored] Mm hmm.
Skinner: Six hours nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees
         twenty-three minutes declination: no sighting.
   Bart: Mm hmm.
          [later]
Skinner: Six hours nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees
         fifty-eight minutes declination: no sighting.  Did you get that
         one Bart?
   Bart: Hell no?
Skinner: Good.

-- Skinner the observator, "Bart's Comet"

Skinner: It's coming pretty close to the ground, maybe I can catch it.
         Don't touch the telescope, Bart.  A slight change in elevation
         can destroy a whole morning's work.  [runs off]
   Bart: [looks at telescope, grins, spins it] Woo!  Pirates off the
         port bow, all hands on deck!  [looks through it] Hey...
          [pushes "redial" on the phone]
         Hello, observatory?  This is Bart Simpson.  I see something in
         the sky at 4-12-8 and the last number is 7.
Skinner: [catching the balloon] Ah, got you, my rumpy doppelganger.
          [floats to ground next to Bart] I've got it!  I -- what are
         you doing?  Give me that phone!
  Woman: [on phone] Congratulations, Bart.  You've just discovered a

 Lisa: {Sounds like you had a good day today, Dad.}
Homer: {Yeah...except I forgot to go to work.}

Marge: What did you do today, Bart?
 Bart: What _didn't_ I do?  [hands his mother a newspaper]
Marge: [reads comet] "Boy Discovers Comet"...
 Lisa: What?
Marge: "A young Springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known
       as the `Bart Simpson Comet'."  [gasps] Oh, honey, I'm so _proud_
       of you.
 Bart: But then, you've _always_ been proud of me.
Marge: [pauses] Yes...
-- Well no, actually, "Bart's Comet"

% The next day at lunch, Bart carries his tray past a table of children.

     Ham: Won't you join us, Bart?

          comet, we're very proud to make you a member of our very
          select group.  Welcome to Super Friends.
    Bart: Huh?
    Kids: Welcome, Super Friend.

-- Bart's not as cool as Green Lantern, "Bart's Comet"

   Database: Perhaps some night you could show us your comet.
       Bart: [pointing] There it is right there.
   Database: I make it a point never to turn my head unless I expect to
             see something, Bart.  Now truly, we can't see your comet in
             broad daylight and without a telescope.
       Bart: But you don't _need_ a stupid telescope.  It's right
             _there_.
              [the kids look and gasp as they see it]
      Email: Oh no, no, no, this isn't right at all!
   Database: It must be coming toward us at a fantastic speed.
       Bart: Huh?
       Lisa: Don't you realize what's happening, Bart?  Your comet is
             going to collide with the Earth and every living thing in
             its path will be killed!
       Bart: I knew you'd try to find something wrong with my comet,
             Lisa.  You've always been petty and small, _right_ from the
             beginning.
Report Card: We must alert the proper authorities.

        First of all, yes, there is a comet in the sky, and yes, it is

        military men who were forced into early retirement for various
        reasons which we won't go into here, nn-hey, we have planned
        this defense for the city: [flicks a switch] as the comet
        hurtles towards the city, our rocket will intercept it and blow
        it to smithereens.

Homer: Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet?  It's going
       to be destroyed, didn't you hear what that guy in the building
       said?
 Lisa: But Dad, don't you think --
Homer: Uh, Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we
       don't _have_ to think all the time.  Just like that rainforest
       scare a few years back: our officials saw there was a problem and
       they fixed it, didn't they?

Homer: There's that word again.

 Lisa: [interrupts] Dad, they're firing the rocket!
Homer: [knocked backwards by the blast] All right!

% The rocket climbs into the sky as everyone oohs and aahs.  Up, up it
% flies, straight up to the comet...and passes right in front of it,
% down, down onto the only bridge out of town, destroying it.

   Lisa: It blew up the bridge!  We're doomed.

% Kent Brockman delivers the news.

       Kent: And, like Icarus, the rocket foolishly soared too high, and
             lost control of its servo guidance mechanism, leaving us
             with some...[checks watch] six hours to live.  So, let's go
             live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of
             town with Arnie Pie and Arnie in the Sky!
      Arnie: With the bridge gone and the airport unfortunately on the
             other side of the bridge, a number of citizens are
             attempting to jump the gorge with their cars.  It's a
             silent testament to the never-give-up and never-think-
             things-out spirit of our citizens.
       Kent: With our utter annihilation imminent, our federal
             government has snapped into action.  We go live now via
             satellite to the floor of the United States congress.
    Speaker: Then it is unanimous, we are going to approve the bill to
             evacuate the town of Springfield in the great state of --
Congressman: Wait a minute, I want to tack on a rider to that bill: $30
             million of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts.
    Speaker: All in favor of the amended Springfield-slash-pervert bill?
              [everyone boos]
    Speaker: Bill defeated.  [bangs gavel]

             doesn't work.
-- Kent Brockman shows his true color: pink, "Bart's Comet"

 Kent: Now, over the years, a newsman learns a number of things that for
       one reason or another, he just cannot report.  It doesn't seem to
       matter now, so...the following people are gay.
        [a list flashes by hurriedly]
Marge: Turn it off!
Homer: [copying down the list quickly] Just a second...
-- Homer and his useless lists, "Bart's Comet"

Homer: What's everyone so worked up about?  So there's a comet -- big
       deal.  It'll burn up in our atmosphere and what's ever left will
       be no bigger than a chihuahua's head.
 Bart: Wow, Dad, maybe you're right.
Homer: Of course I'm right.  If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed
       from above somehow.
        [everyone groans]
       OK, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb
       shelter.
 Lisa: We have a bomb shelter?
Homer: Homer Simpson takes care of _his_ family.

Homer: [pounding on a door] Flanders!  Open up.
-- Homer, living vicariously through Ned, "Bart's Comet"

  Ned: Heidy-hoeroony, neighbor.  What can I do you for?
Homer: Get out of there.  My family needs to use your bomb shelter.
Marge: Homer!
  Ned: Uh oh, I kind of figured this might happen, so I built the
       shelter big enough for both our families.
Homer: No deal.  Out.
Marge: Get in the shelter, Homer!
-- Homer rejects the first offer, "Bart's Comet"

% The shadow of the comet looms over the city hall.  It looms over the
% zoo, to the frightened protests of the animals.  Some penguins look at
% one another and then suddenly develop the ability to fly.  A boy
% working on his bike in the street leaves it there and hides under a

% In Ned's bomb shelter, the two families sit around, bored.

Marge: [checks her watch] One more hour.

        [someone knocks on the door]
       Ah, there it is.
        [Ned answers it; the rest of Springfield stands outside]
  Ned: Well, howdily-doodily, neighbors.  Shouldn't you be in your
       shelterinis by now?
  Moe: [menacing] We haven't got shelterinis.  We want in yours!
  Ned: Well, ho ho, the shelter's kind of full.
  Moe: [not realizing] Really?  Oh.  Well, we'll just go off some place
       and die then.  Thanks.  [everyone walks off]
  Ned: Wait!  You know, I may regret this when our air runs out and we

-- Moe's bargaining tactics, "Bart's Comet"

% The shelter is very crowded indeed with everyone there.

  Homer: I can't get the -- [struggles] -- I can't get the door closed.
         Somebody's going to have to get out.
   Lisa: [muffled] I'd get out but I don't know where I am.
 Barney: Hey!  Somebody's touching me.
Skinner: I am.
 Barney: [happy] Oh, OK.
-- Ned's shelter brims over capacity, "Bart's Comet"

% Krusty, ever resourceful, comes up with a plan.

 Krusty: OK, OK, let's figure out who should stay.  The world of the
         future will need laughter, so I'm in.
    Moe: And they'll need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e., me, and
         someone'll have to run the power.  You can do that, Homer.
  Homer: [uncertain] Uh, yeah...I can do that.
          [the comet looms ever closer]
Lovejoy: OK, let's start again.  We'll need laughter, religious
         enlightenment, gossip -- that's Mrs. Lovejoy --
-- Predicting the future world necessities, "Bart's Comet"

Homer: Wait a minute: we all know the one thing we won't need in the
       future!  Left-handed stores.  That's you, Flanders!
        [whispered to Rod & Todd] I'm terribly story.
        [to everyone] Flanders is the only useless person here.  If
       anyone dies, it should be him.
        [whispered] I'm sorry, please forgive me.
        [to everyone] So let's kick Flanders out.
        [whispered] Sorry.
  Ned: Well sir, sounds fair.  Toodleloo, everybody; I'll scream when
       the comet gets here.
Maude: Oh, I'm coming with you, Neddy.
  Ned: No, sweetheart, you...you stay here because --
Maude: [quickly] OK.
  Ned: I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot
       Daddy if he tries to get back in.

% Moe suggests something to lighten the mood.

       Moe: Hey, uh, I got an idea: we can play a game to pass the time.
            Er, I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal, and, er, you
            all try to guess what it is.  Ahem: [makes some
            unidentifiable noise]
    Wiggum: It's a pig!
      Bart: It's a cow, man.
      Lisa: It's a pony.
    Krusty: No, it's a goat.  You know, one of them lady goats.
     Selma: There are no lady goats: a lady goat is a sheep.
   Hibbert: I believe she's right.
      Otto: You're crazy.
McAllister: Arr, what's it to you?
      Otto: What's it to _me_?

         more.  I can't let that brave man out there die alone.  I'm
         surprised and disgusted by all of you -- especially his
         children.  I'm going out there!
          [goes out, slams door behind him]
          [pops his head back in] It was a baby ox.
    Moe: He's right, you know.
Skinner: [surprised] About the ox?
    Moe: About everything, dammit.  Hey Homer, wait up.  I want to die

          Will I be pretty?  Will I be rich?"
          Here's what she said to me:

    Bart: Cool.  [picks up what's left of the comet]
    Lisa: We're saved!
Everyone: Yay!
   Selma: Sure makes you appreciate the preciousness of life.
