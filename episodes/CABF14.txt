> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [From the Simpsons Archive Episode Guide] In a "Run, Lola, Run" [and "Go"]
   parody, a breakfast accident involving Marge's kitchen knife and Homer's
   thumb is seen through the eyes of individual family members. While Homer &
   Marge make a mad dash for the hospital, Lisa takes her linguistic robot to
   the Springfield science fair, and Bart runs afoul of Fat Tony's illegal
   fireworks ring. Guest starring Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony.

Blackboard:     FIRE IS NOT THE CLEANSER

                FIRE IS NOT THE           at cutoff

Couch:          The family skateboards to the couch, jumping off a
                conveniently placed ramp and doing some nifty aerial stunts
                before landing.  Or at least most of the family does.  Homer
                falls off the edge of the ramp, landing on his bottom.  Adding
                both insult and injury, his skateboard bounces off the top of
                his head.  [Recycled from CABF04]

==============================================================================

Don Del Grande:
   ... the Springfield Shopper has a date on it (March 21)?
   ... Homer belongs to an HMO now?
   ... they bother to explain why West Springfield Elementary looks exactly
       like Springfield Elementary?
   ... nobody noticed that Lisa's friend was missing from class for hours?
   ... we can add Miss Hoover to the characters that sound different when
       Marcia Mitzman-Gaven voices them than when Maggie Roswell did?

Joe Green:
   ... Linguo's arms are made of Tinkertoy (TM) wheels and horseshoe magnets?
   ... Marge calls Ranier Wolfcastle "McBain"?

Darrel Jones:
   ... Homer hitch-hikes right-handed?
   ... Lisa apparently does aerobics to the Macintosh start-up sound?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Shelbyville is at least 20 miles from Springfield?
   ... the French bread, French toast, and French fries on the poster in the
       French classroom?
   ... Ms. Hoover speaks for the first time since Maggie Roswell left the
       show?

Jared Rasmussen:
   ... the Flanders have a mailbox and The Simpsons don't?
   ... the Simpsons' garbage can was in the street rather than on the lawn by
       the curb (like the Flanders')?
   ... the "Wanted" posted of Fat Tony in the police office?
   ... Thelonious snorts when he laughs?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... as Homer and Lisa bolt from the table, Maggie is trapped in her
       juicelix?
   ... Linguo has a Mickey Mouse left hand?
   ... the number 478071 flashes on Linguo's chest when he reports an error?
   ... Lisa and Thelonious can spin "for hours" without getting dizzy?

Elson Trinidad:
   ... Homer's severed thumb has a thumbnail (cos according to Dr. Hibbert, a
       thumb is not a finger, right? :)) and thumb joint markings -- both of
       which are almost always absent in the hands of all Simpsons characters?
   ... Homer put his severed thumb in his right front pocket as he went to
       retrieve Linguo's head?
   ... the detached thumb is darker in color when it's shriveled up in liquid,
       but it is lighter in color after it is re-attached during the Science
       Fair?
   ... Chief Wiggum is left-handed?

=  When Homer bled after his thumb was severed, there was no blood on the
   kitchen floor.  {ddg}

-  A white cloth on Lisa's lap disappears while she shows Linguo to Homer.
   {bjr}

=  Linguo's head appears to get bigger after he explodes.  {jg2}

*  Maggie was at the breakfast table when they were eating that gooey cereal.
   Later, when Marge accidentally severs Homer's thumb, and they drive off,
   Maggie is nowhere to be seen.  ["They originally wrote a 'Maggie's Day'
   section, but unfortunately it got cut," jokes Elson Trinidad -- Ed.]  {dc}

c  Audio:  "I had to do awful things to pay for her."  Captioning:  "I did bad
   things to pay for this."  {tpl}

+  Milhouse is on the school bus in "Lisa's Day."  {ja}

   Club."  {tpl}

+  Lisa claims she has no friends.  What are Janey and Allison, chopped liver?
   {bjr}

=  Thelonious's watch disappears between shots.  {jr}

=  When spinning in a circle with Lisa, Thelonious's watch switches from his
   left arm to his right.  {jr}

c  Ticking of his inventory of keys, Bart says, "Front door, back door,
   Skinner's, Flanders', your house ... ah, Lisa's bike."  The captioning
   read, "Front door, back door, gun lock, gun lock, trigger lock ... ah,
   Lisa's bike."

=  The key Bart identifies as being the one for Milhouse's home is also the
   one he uses to unlock Lisa's bike.  {bjr}

=  As the boys approach the cave, Milhouse appears to be riding a boys' bike.
   When they stop, the crossbar magically goes to the bottom again.  It's so
   smooth it almost looks intentional.  {gm}

*  The chase through the caves didn't appear to last that long, but if you
   work out the timeline, it would have to have taken around three hours.
   {mg}

=  When Bart comes out of the sewer during "Bart's Day", the animation of the
   truck Marge is driving is jerky.  {ddg}

*  Martin proclaimed that first place in the science fair would be his, but in
   the end, the fair seemed limited to Lisa's class.  {ddg}

*  Miss Hoover's voice was off key?  (well, d'uh!)  {hl}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Don Del Grande:  It's this century's "22 Short Films About Springfield",
   except that it just seemed funnier -- maybe because the stories weren't
   quite as disjointed.  (Fewer stories mean fewer chances to blow it, I
   suppose.)  (A-)

Joe Green:  This episode not only featured some extremely funny moments, but
   actually figured out a way to make an OFF episode with multiple plotlines
   work, as opposed to the barrage of
   "we've-run-out-of-ideas-and-we're-proud-of-it" mishmashes we've gotten
   recently.  Thanks to shows like this and "Brothers Little Helper", I'd
   *really* like to see George Meyer get back to writing more often.  [All
   right, but Matt Selman was the lead writer for this episode -- Ed.]  (A+)

Darrel C. Jones:  Totally excellent episode!  (I'll "sentence fragment" you,
   stupid grammar robot!)  All the parts link together flawlessly, and the
   lose ends are tied up like so many displaced thumbs.  Frankie Muniz's
   appearance was much smaller than I thought it would be which, in this
   Malcolm in the Middle hater's mind, is a plus.  A true classic.  10/10
   (A+)

Andrew J. Milner:  I've been down on OFF for the past season, so in the
   interest of fairness I have to say that tonite's episode was excellent.
   Good laughs, good payoffs, excellent quotes -- an episode you obviously had
   to watch closely to appreciate.  (A-)

Michael Nusair:  Any episode like this is bound to be a risk:  If done well,
   it could be really good, however, if executed poorly, it could be *really*
   bad. Fortunately, "Trilogy of Error" was very well done.  All three stories
   were really good, with lots of laughs throughout.  I especially liked the
   scene with the mobsters overloading the grammar-robot (whose name eludes me
   at the moment).  As well, it was neat to see the three stories intermingle.
   Add to this a non-gratuitous celebrity guest-voice, and you've got a pretty
   damn good episode.  Here's hoping that they write more creative episodes
   like this (but not like "Behind the Laughter."  I *hated* that).  (A)

Mike Nuss:  This episode was definitely weird, but one of the most memorable
   of the season.  I didn't think the current writers had it in them to make a
   story that fit together so well from three separate angles, but they did a
   fairly good job, and I was pleasantly surprised that they actually managed
   to wrap up all three storylines at once.  The parallels to "Run Lola Run"
   were obvious, and I appreciated Lisa's running sequences with the techno
   background as an obvious homage to the film.  There were some nice jokes in
   there too, like Wiggum ratting out his own informant, and good
   old-fashioned Bart playing a prank on Seymour Skinner.  Nicely done! The
   only question is: where's Maggie?  (A-)

Mike Reed:  Whoa!  Never thought I'd say this again, but that was one of the
   best episodes ever!  Easily makes my top 20 list.  It must have taken them
   all year to write this one, as almost every scene was later brought up in
   the episode ... which will make it really tough to syndicate.  (A+)

Javier Vera:  I loved this episode, it was one of the very best I've seen in a
   long time.  The main idea for the episode was excellent, as was the story
   itself.  Frankie Muniz's cameo was outstanding, as short as it was.
   Probably one of the best written episodes in the history of the series, and
   without a doubt the best in the last four seasons (along with the hailed
   "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)").  They should really give Matt Selman an award
   for this.  The only sad thing is that I don't think there will ever be a
   better episode than this one.  (A)

Vince Yim:  Taking a cue from popular cinema, The Simpsons borrows from such
   films utilizing alternative structure, such as "Pulp Fiction," "Go," "Lola
   rennt" (a.k.a. "Run, Lola, Run") and Groundhog Day.  This is a special
   treat especially for movie buffs.  While not perfect (but then, characters
   act out of character from time to time to keep the show fresh, I suppose),
   it's one of the funniest episodes to boot.  It's been a long time coming.
   (A-)

Yours Truly:  The most remarkable thing about "Trilogy" is the efficient way
   its three stories -- each focusing on how different members of the Simpson
   family spend one day -- interlock.  Events that are unexplained, or just
   seem insignificant, in one act take on new meaning and are resolved in the
   next so that, in the end, nothing is wasted.  This episode has other
   charms, too.  It was nice to see Homer's thumb injury treated in a
   semi-plausible, yet funny, way.  Frankie Muniz's character is a good match
   for Lisa; I'd enjoy seeing him again in a future episode.  This episode was
   obviously an exercise in nonlinear storytelling, but if its notions of
   story-telling economy and plot resolution rub off on the regular episodes,
   well, then so much the better.  (A)

AVERAGE GRADE:  A (3.97)   Std Dev.: 0.3147   (13 reviews computed)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Writer Watch

Javier Vera:  Matt Selman joined in the ninth season and has written some
   memorable episodes of the show.  He started with "Natural Born Kissers",
   one of Matt Groening's favorites.  He also wrote "They Saved Lisa's Brain",
   "Eight Misbehaivin'" and "Lisa The Treehugger".  I believe that Matt
   [Selman] has a personal talent for writing episodes where the whole family
   is the star, as "Trilogy of Error" proves that fact [indisputably].


>> Musical References

I. Might identifies the song playing in Cletus's truck:  "Keep Lookin' For
   Tumbleweeds, Danny," [by NRBQ].  I thought I heard the distinctive "we'll
   hop, hop, hop" of the song.


Joe Green:  "Happy Together" by the Turtles (song) is played while Lisa,
   Thelonious and Linguo swing around.


Vince Yim, about the "Run, Lola, Run" music:  The track in question is
   entitled "Running One", by Tom Tykwer, Johnny Klimek, and Reinhold Heil.


>> Springfield DayRunner

Matt Garvey does some painstaking research, and has this to present:  Here's a
   chronological listing of how the three stories match up. It's pretty easy
   to follow; there are only a few times when events had to happen some time
   but not immediately before others. (Also, I only supplied times that were
   given; others can be surmised, like 12:02 for when Homer enters the bar,
   and 3:00 for the end.)

   Three inconsistencies manifest themselves upon examination of the chart.
   Homer gets drunk in the time it takes Lisa to run around the outside of
   Moe's, find Marge, and explain her situation; but with his "massive blood
   loss" I'm willing to buy that.  (And who's to say he only mentioned the
   Blue Man Group once?)

   Homer seems to arrive at the alley rather quickly, but it could just be
   that it looks far away, and Linguo was able to make it that far ... so
   that's ok.

   The third one is very odd indeed:  The length of the chase (from when they
   discover the wire to when Marge almost kills Bart) is about THREE HOURS!  I
   suppose it's possible that they ran through caves for that long, or
   possibly it included such events as hiding/being discovered and getting
   lost underground ... oh well.

   BTW, I can believe that Lisa ran 3/4 of an hour to Moe's -- considering
   she's 8 she probably has a top speed of 5 or 6 mph at a full out sprint,
   and she _was_ coming from West Springfield.


>> Harry Potter and the Religious Right

Jeff Cross writes:  JK Rowling's hyper-popular "Harry Potter" book series
   follows a young British boy's adventures at a school that trains children
   to use magic. It has drawn a fair amount of flak from more religious
   parents because they believe it could lead children on a path towards the
   King of Lawyers: the school claims it teaches "witchcraft," which they
   believe leads to the occult and devil worship and the end of morality as we
   know it.


Joe Klemm adds:  In reality, these tales are just stories that encourages
   children to read the adventures of Harry and his buds, Ron and Hermione.


Benjamin Robinson:  I notice that after Ned finishes reading the book, he
   immediately burns it.  This is probably not coincidental.


>> What the hell?  A C&D order from the Smurfs?

Benjamin Robinson:  A performing-arts trio best known for Intel's quirky
   commercials promoting the Pentium III (and now IV) processors.  They
   actually got their start many, many years before, gaining popularity as an
   off- Broadway act.  I've seen them perform some of the bits from their show
   on TV, and, judging from this, what they do for Intel's ads is similar --
   wacky stunts with splattering paint, gymnastics, and other daring- do.
   People either like it, or, like Homer, think it's weird.  Or maybe both.


>> Kiss first place goodbye, Martin

"Ramblin' Ramba" M. C. Grant writes:  Commonly regarded as goof:  Martin and
   Lisa are in different classes and thus cannot compete.  Maybe the winners
   from each class get together and have a school-wide competition.  Lisa, as
   Martin's only true rival in Springfield, not competing due to missing the
   bus, would guarantee Martin first place.  Just a thought, eh?


Tim O'Darr:  This is no goof.  Remember when Lisa experimented on her brother
   after Bart tossed her giant tomato at Skinner's butt?  He then beat HER
   (and we know they aren't in the same grade) with his hamster who could fly.
   The entire school was judged collectively.


Jeff Robertson:  My school only had one school-wide competition.  There was no
   competing with just the people in your own class.


Andrew Krupowicz:  Same here.  The kids who had no idea what they were doing
   were on equal footing with the older kids who had no idea what they were
   doing.


Kerry Dem:  At first I was thinking that Allison would also give Martin a run
   for his money, but she's probably not the true scientific type.  She's more
   an English & literature type, wouldn't you say?  So yes, if Lisa hadn't
   competed, Martin probably would've been guaranteed first place.


>> "Well, you're the birthday boy"

Joe Green notes:  The scene where Lou asks Chief Wiggum if he can hold his gun
   sideways refers to a relatively recent action-film cliche, most likely
   inspired by the films of Hong Kong-born director John Woo.  Ironically,
   I've been told by some firearms experts that trying to shoot people while
   holding a gun sideways isn't quite as effective as Hollywood seems to
   think.


Haynes Lee adds:  Hollywood cops' way of shooting handguns which in practice
   will screw up your wrist.


"That Guy" (seriously, that's how he identified himself) disputes this:  Why
   would holding a gun sideways screw up your wrist?  The recoil on the gun
   exists on matter which way it is pointed.  The direction of the recoil in
   the opposite of the direction of the projectile. Either way, it's a thump
   on the heel of your hand and the base of your thumb.  I don't see what
   difference it would make to your wrist whether you are holding the gun
   vertically or horizontally.

   The sites on a gun are adjusted for vertical drop.  Holding your pistol
   sideways would throw off your aim and would be useless for any but very
   close-range shooting.


Scott Weaver:  The gun reference wasn't to Hollywood police officers, it was a
   spook on every movie about the hood, or most rap videos.  If you watch a
   rap video or a movie like "Boyz in the Hood," you see the Gangstas hold
   their gun at an angle rather than hold it normally.  That is why Lou said
   it looks so cool.


>> Car Watch's Day

Joe Green:  One of the cars that passes Homer when he hitchhikes is a late-
   1980s Corvette.


Benjamin Robinson:  The car McBain drives is an actual late-model Ferrari, but
   I don't recall which one it was.  (It's not a Testarossa.  A 288GTO,
   maybe?)  [Internet King says it's an F40 -- Ed.] His car has a back seat,
   which is technically an error.  Of recent Ferraris, only the 465 and the
   Mondial had rear seating, and McBain's car definitely wasn't either of
   those.

   Cletus drives a late 40s or early 50s Chevrolet pickup truck.


>> Fun with Promotions

Haynes Lee:  The tick on the back of Cletus' head shown in the commercial was
   not in the episode.


One Monk describes the scene:  The tick scene in the commercial was from where
   Homer is in Cletus' truck. Homer says to Cletus "There's something behind
   your ear."  Cletus turns his head and Homer goes "It's a tick!"  And it
   shows a tick run from behind Cletus' ear and onto his forehead.


Mike Reed transcribes another promo:

   Voice-Over: It's a special 90 minute Simpsons marathon!
   (Homer reaches for a brownie, then screams.)
   Marge: I'm sorry!
   Homer: Sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, Marge!
   (Homer tries to get his severed thumb away from SLH over the timeslot.)


Benjamin Robinson:  Perhaps I'm imagining things, but I think the dialog
   between Bart and Milhouse as they rode their bikes to the fireworks cave
   changed a little.  In a commercial airing shortly before the show's
   premiere, Bart asks Milhouse, "How's that girls' bike treating you?"  In
   the show proper, the line is, "What's it like riding a girls' bike?"


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this episode is:  Homer Got Fingered


Joe Green suggests:  Choose Your Own Misadventure


Jeremy Gallen suggests:  "Run Lisa Run" or "Lisa rennt"


In a similar vein, Joe Klemm suggests:  "Run, Homer, Run"

-- Master of subtlety, "Trilogy of Error"

% Lisa shows her father her science-fair project, a little homemade
% robot.

Lisa:	Meet Linguo, the grammar robot.  I built him all by

Homer:	Oh God, Oh God, Oh God!
Marge:	I'm sorry!  I'm so sorry!
Homer:	Sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, Marge!
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Marge quickly bandages Homer's hand, and tells him that if they can
% get to the hospital quickly enough, the doctors can re-attach it. 
% That may be easier said than done.  In the confusion, Santa's Little
% Helper has nabbed Homer's thumb.  Homer tries tackling the dog, but

%
% Meanwhile, Marge calls 911.

Wiggum:	[answering phone] 9-1-1.  This'd better be good.
Marge:	I cut off my husband's thumb!
Wiggum:	Attempted murder?  You'll burn for this -- burn in jail!
Marge:	It was an accident.
Wiggum:	Yeah, yeah.  Save it for "Dateline: Tuesday."  Uh, what's 
	your address so I can come arrest you?
Marge:	Arrest me?  Um, my address, it's um, 1-2-3 ... Fake 
	Street.

	[SLH runs off]
	Oh, I have nothing he wants.
-- Except maybe the other thumb, "Trilogy of Error"

% Ned reads a story to Todd.

Ned:	[reading] Harry Potter, and all his wizard friends, went

Todd:	Yay!
	[Ned tosses the book into the fireplace, and it burns]
-- Fundamentalist story-time hour, "Trilogy of Error"

% Santa's Little Helper and Homer bound through the Flanders' living
% room.  "What the diddly-o?" Ned yells.  Homer finally grabs the dog,
% knocking the thumb into the path of Rod's electric train.  Just
% before the engine can run over the thumb, Homer stomps on the track,
% saving the thumb but ruining Rod's train.
%
% No time for remorse, though.  Homer and Marge rush in their car to
% seek medical help.  Marge is at the wheel.

Marge:	We've got to get to the hospital, Homer.
Homer:	Okay, if the doctor asks why you cut it off, you caught me 
	in bed with four beautiful women.
Marge:	Let's just say that Bart did it.
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Thinking up an alibi distracts Marge from the road, and she rear-
% ends another car.

Ranier:	[gets out of his car] My Ferrari!  I had to do awful 
	things to pay for her.
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% The enraged actor pulls a golf club from his car and exacts revenge
% on the Simpsons' windshield.  While Wolfcastle focuses on that,
% Homer sneaks into the Ferrari, and motions for Marge to come join
% him.  She does, and they are soon on their way to Springfield
% General Hospital.
%
% At the hospital, they consult with Dr. Hibbert.

Hibbert:	I'm sorry, Homer.  Your HMO doesn't cover this type 
		of injury.
Homer:		But I have finger insurance.
Hibbert:	A thumb is not a finger!
Marge:		Isn't there anything you can do?
Hibbert:	Well, I could cut off the other thumb for a sense of 
		symmetry.
Homer:		Symmetry, eh?
		[cut to Homer and Marge driving in the Ferrari]
Marge:		Hibbert's really losing it.  We're going to Dr. 
		Nick's.
-- Now you're talking desperate, "Trilogy of Error"

% The thumb is starting to fade, so the Marge and Homer stop at Moe's
% for some more ice.  Homer goes into the bar while Marge waits in the
% car.

Homer:	Quick, Moe!  Marge cut off my thumb.
Moe:	No problem.  Just stick the ol' eye-gouger in the pickle 
	brine.  That'll keep your thumb fresh and delicious.
Homer:	[puts the thumb in the pickled-egg jar, and takes the jar 
	toward the front door] Thanks, Moe.
Moe:	Hey-ya, hey!  Ain't you gonna have a beer?  [sets a mug on 
	the bar]
Homer:	Well, I really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss 
	and all.  Although I do like the occasional beer.
	[several occasions later]
	[drunkenly] Did you ever see that Blue Man Group?  Total 
	rip-off of the Smurfs.  And the Smurfs -- they suck!  
[passes out]
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Moe smells the tell-tale scent of gangrene, and realizes he has to
% revive Homer.  Barney suggests a pot of coffee, which works.  Homer
% runs outside -- only to find Marge has gone!
%
% Homer tries hitchhiking, but his hitching thumb is the one in the
% jar.  Even so, Cletus the hick stops for him.

Homer:	Hey, thanks for stopping.
Cletus:	Tain't nothing.  You and me share a common infirmity.  If 
	anyone ever tells you a hog won't eat a finger, they's 
	lying.  [holds up his left hand, which has two fingers 
	missing]
-- Country wisdom, "Trilogy of Error"

% Cletus and Homer arrive at Dr. Nick's clinic, but Homer's streak of
% bad luck continues.  The clinic is on fire.  Dr. Nick talks to the
% fire chief, saying, "'Inflammable' means 'flammable'?  What a
% country!"  It makes you wonder what led up to that incident.
%
% Homer doesn't have time to consider that, though.  He asks Cletus if
% he can take him to Shelbyville Hospital, but a thief makes off with
% Cletus's truck.  Homer has to walk the twenty miles to Shelbyville.
%
% He makes it a mile or so out of town before realizing that it's
% futile.  Homer sadly concedes defeat, sets down the pickled-egg jar,
% and cradles his thumb in his hand.  "Well, friend, we always knew
% this day would come," he says.  "Say goodbye to your brother." 
% There's a "bang" in the distance.  Something is launched from the
% city, and lands near Homer.  It's Linguo's head!

Homer:	[gasps] Linguo -- dead?
Linguo:	Linguo *is* dead.  [fades out]

% Lisa just barely misses the bus, delighting Martin, who figures he
% has a lock on first place.  Lisa runs to the back yard to get her
% bike, but it's missing.  She tries to get a ride from her mother,
% but by now Homer and Marge are rushing to the hospital.  Desperate,
% she begins to run to school.  Downtown, a limousine almost hits her
% as she crosses the street.  Krusty leans out the rear passenger's

Krusty:	[to his chauffeur] Idiot!  You almost ran over a viewer!  
	And she's in our key demo.
	[to Lisa] Sorry about that, kid.  Need a ride?
Lisa:	Can you take me to school, Krusty?
Krusty:	Hop in.
	[Lisa gets in the car.  Cut to the inside of the limo]
	[taps on the dividing glass] Hey, moron -- Springfield

Wiggum:	Ah, it's okay.  Hey, we got the same hat.  [drives off]
-- What's under it is similar, too, "Trilogy of Error"

% Mr. Teeny drops Lisa off at school.  She goes to her classroom, and
% is surprised to discover a French language class in progress.

Lisa:		Huh?  This isn't Miss Hoover's class.
Teacher:	[heavy French accent] I do not know this 
		mademoiselle Oo-vair of which you speak.
Lisa:		What's happening?  Where am I?
Teacher:	Sacre bleu!  What a foolish question.  You are at 
		West Springfield Elementary School.
Lisa:		*West* Springfield!?  I'm at the wrong school!
		[the class laughs]
Teacher:	En Francais.
		[class laughs with a stereotypical French accent]
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Lisa runs down the hall and literally bumps into another student, a
% boy about her age.

Lisa:		Sorry.  I was rushing because I'm at the wrong 
		school.  [giggles] Can you believe that?
Thelonious:	It's understandable.  All the schools in this area 
		were built from identical plans.  I guess they 
		didn't have enough money to hire I. M. Pei.
Lisa:		You know about I. M. Pei?  I. M. Impressed.
		[they share a laugh]
Thelonious:	My name's Thelonious.
Lisa:		As in "Monk?"
Thelonious:	Yes.  The esoteric appeal is worth the beatings.
Lisa:		What do your friends call you?
Thelonious:	I don't really have any friends.
Lisa:		[gasps] Just like me!
-- Birds of a feather, "Trilogy of Error"

% Lisa and Thelonious hold hands and joyfully twirl around on West
% Springfield's front lawn.  Linguo joins in at some point. 
% Eventually, Lisa stops.

Lisa:		Oh, my God!  It's 11:15!  We've been spinning for 
		hours.  I've got to get to my school and hand in 
		Linguo.  Oh, but I don't want to leave you.
Thelonious:	You must.  You can't sacrifice grades for romance.  
		That's not the girl I fell for.
Lisa:		Will I ever see you again.
Thelonious:	Of course you will.  At the magnet high school.  Now 
		go!
-- If you love someone, set them free, "Trilogy of Error"

% Lisa starts running again.  Forty-five minutes later, she's in front
% of Moe's tavern.  She goes in, hoping to find her father there. 
% Homer hasn't shown up yet, but Chief Wiggum is sitting at one of the
% booths, listening intently to a 2-way radio.  Lisa jogs up to him.

Lisa:	Chief Wiggum, can you take me to school?  It's an 
	emergency.
Wiggum:	Uh, no can do, dollface.  I've got this informant wearing 
	a wire.  Heh -- just like on "Nash Bridges."  We're trying 
	to get the goods on some smugglers.
Tony:	[over the radio] Why, I'd be delighted to sell you some 
	illegally smuggled goods.
Lisa:	That sounds like Fat Tony.
Wiggum:	Only one way to be sure.  [picks up a microphone] Fat 
	Tony, is that you?  Fat Tony!
Legs:	[over the radio] Hey, where'd that voice come from?
Louie:	[over the radio] This guy's wearing a wire.
Tony:	[over the radio] Take him out.
	[ominous bangs]
Wiggum:	My bad!  Can't work my answering machine, either.  Now I 
	need a new informant.  Say, Lisa, people trust you.  How'd 
	you like to be a snitch?  The pay stinks, but ... [notices 
	Lisa heading for the bar's rear door] Oh.
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Just then, Homer runs into the tavern.  It seems Marge has cut off
% his thumb, and he needs to put it on ice ...
%
% Lisa runs to the front of the bar.  Marge spots her, calls her over
% to the car, and rather casually relates the day's events.  When
% Homer gets started on the Blue Man Group, Marge figures she has
% plenty of time to get her daughter to school.
%
% More tough luck for Lisa -- the car runs out of gas.  Cletus's truck
% pulls up for a light, so Marge and Lisa hitch a ride by hopping in
% back with the chickens.
%
% Meanwhile, up in the cab, Homer entertains Cletus by doing that
% "detaching your own thumb" bit.  Now, however, he can do it for
% real.

Homer:	Abraca-thumb-bra!
Cletus:	[laughs] Dang, you could be one of them TV magic queers.
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Cletus stops at Dr. Nick's clinic, and he and Homer get out of the
% truck.  Marge and Lisa are too busy digging themselves out from
% under spilled chicken crates to notice them.  It's getting late, and
% Lisa begs her mother to get her to school.  Reasoning that she's
% already "borrowed" one car today, Marge takes Cletus's truck.
%
% Cletus yells after his missing truck.  Homer dourly begins the long
% walk to Shelbyville.
%
% Marge and Lisa barrel down the road to school.  Suddenly, one of the
% manhole covers in the street opens up.  Bart climbs up through the
% hole and into the path of the truck.  Could this be the end for
% America's bad boy?
%
% [It's the end of Act Two, at least.  Time:  13:54]
%
% Springfield awakens to a beautiful new day of blue skies and warm
% sunshine.  A garbage truck makes its rounds, its mechanical can-
% lifting arm uprooting Ned's mailbox.  ("Son of a diddly," Ned
% mutters.)  The paperboy delivers news of a truce between picnickers
% and ants.  Bart's Krusty the Clown alarm clock goes off.  It is the
% start of ...
%
%                             Bart's Day
%
% Bart hits the snooze button.  In response, mechanical Itchy and
% Scratchy figures pop out of Krusty's forehead and strike Bart with a
% mallet and an axe.  Bart wakes up as his mother announces breakfast
% is ready.

	[the doorbell rings]
Bart:	It's Milhouse.
	[the doorbell rings several more times]
	And it sounds like he has big news!  [runs out of the 
	room]
-- Bart ducks out on a crappy breakfast, "Trilogy of Error"

% Milhouse does have big news.

Milhouse:	I found something awesome in the woods!
Bart:		Is it a dead body?
Milhouse:	It's cooler than a million dead bodies!
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Bart and Milhouse gleefully run to the back yard to fetch some
% bikes.  Bart grabs his bike, and offers Lisa's to Milhouse.  Bart
% has to flip through a huge ring of keys before finding the one to
% Lisa's bike lock, but soon the boys are riding through the woods. 
% (Milhouse says it's "disturbingly comfortable" to ride a girls'
% bike.)  Milhouse takes Bart to cave, where his big discovery lies.

Bart:		Whoa.  How'd you find it?
Milhouse:	This is where I come to cry.
Bart:		Cool.
		[Milhouse leads Bart to a chamber within the cave, 
		which holds ten or twenty sacks]
		Sacks!  Burlap sacks!
Milhouse:	It gets better -- they're full of fireworks!  [opens 
		one, revealing a bundle of fireworks]
Bart:		[surveying the cache] Bottle rockets, frog 
		launchers, wheezing mamas ... [holds up a 
		particularly large firework] Tijuana toilet-
		crackers!
-- Worth their weight in gold, "Trilogy of Error"

% The boys go on a firework-lighting spree.  They blow up Skinner's
% garden gnomes.  They launch fireworks into an Army training base,
% scaring the daylights out of the soldiers.  They attach bottle
% rockets to a bicycle wheel, and light them.  The fiery wheel spins
% rapidly, then launches itself off the bike.
%
% Meanwhile, in Dr. Nick's clinic, Cap'n McAllister is about to
% undergo some light surgery.

Dr. Nick:	So, what are we doing?  A lengthening, or a 
		widening?
Cap'n:		Yar, er, let's make it both.
		[the flaming wheel flies into the office through an 
		open window, and lands on a canister of ether as if 
		it were peg in a ring-toss game]
Cap'n:		Yar!
Dr. Nick:	Don't worry; it's inflammable.
		["inflammable" means "flammable" -- the canister and 
		the office quickly ignite]
		Let's keep this our little secret.
-- Patient-doctor confidentiality, "Trilogy of Error"

% Bart and Milhouse are walking down the street when they hear the
% sirens closing in on them.  Not wanting to do time for illegal
% fireworks profession, they duck into an abandoned building with a
% funny address:  123 Fake St.
%
% Chief Wiggum pulls up, having finally found his destination -- the
% home of "knifey-wifey."  Lou gets permission to hold his cocked
% sideways, like actors in the movies, because it's his birthday.
%
% The cops burst into the room.

Wiggum:		Okay, drop the knife, Stabitha!  [notices Bart and 
		Milhouse trying to stuff a sack of fireworks into a 
		closet]
		Great Grucci's ghost.  We've uncovered a hard-core
		cracker house.
Lou:		There's enough Chinese sky candy here to put you 
		boys away for a long time.
Milhouse:	I can't go to juvey.  They use guys like me as 
		currency.
Wiggum:		Yeah, they'll pass you around like ... [pauses to 
		think] well, like currency, like you said.
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% "Maybe we can make you boys a deal," Wiggum says.  Later, he and the
% boys are sitting at one of the booths in Moe's tavern.  Wiggum rigs
% Bart up with a walkie-talkie and outlines his plan.

Wiggum:	Your mission is to find the fireworks smugglers, and get 
	them to say something incriminating on this tape.  [holds 
	up a cassette tape]
Bart:	[reading the tape label] "Hootie and the Blowfish"?
Wiggum:	Yeah.  It's cheaper than blank tape.
-- I'll just say "ouch" for Hootie, "Trilogy of Error"

% Back at the cave, Fat Tony, Legs, and Louie start loading fireworks
% from a large box into the sacks.  They remark that they like this
% new gig much better than running unions, a job that involved too
% much paperwork.  Bart interrupts them.

Bart:		Knock, knock.  Excuse me.  My friend and I were 
		interested in purchasing quality fireworks.
Milhouse:	[conspicuously into Bart's shirt] Yes, we are.
Tony:		Why, I'd be delighted to sell you some illegally 
		smuggled goods.  [holds up a string of firecrackers]
Wiggum:		[over the radio] Fat Tony, is that you?  Fat Tony!
Legs:		Hey, where'd that voice come from?
Louie:		[lifts Bart's shirt] This guy's wearing a wire.
Tony:		[points to Bart] Take him out.  
		[Bart lights the fireworks Fat Tony's holding, and 
		they go off with a bang.  He takes the bag and runs 
		away with Milhouse]
Wiggum:		[over the radio] My bad!
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% Tony and his men give chase, using sparkers to light their way.  The
% mobsters corner Bart and Milhouse at a dead end in the cave.  Legs
% and Louie draw their guns.  Bart looks up, and sees a manhole cover
% overhead.  The sparklers burn down, singing the men's hands, and
% Bart uses the darkness and confusion to climb the ladder to the
% manhole.  Milhouse follows him.
%
% Out of the frying pan, into the fire, it seems.  Bart emerges in
% front of Cletus's truck.  Marge brakes hard, but still dinks Bart in
% the back of the head.  There's not much time to complain.  Bart and
% Milhouse crawl out of the manhole, with the gangsters close behind.
%
% Bart and Milhouse climb up some crates and then over a fence into an
% alleyway.  The mobsters climb the same fence and close in on the
% boys, who are trapped.  Fat Tony kicks down the crates so no one
% else can follow them into the alley.  Marge runs up to the fence,
% and yells at Fat Tony.  Then, she takes Linguo out of Lisa's
% backpack and throws him at the gangsters.  He hits Louie and comes
% to rest sitting on the pavement.

Louie:	Hey!  They's throwing robots!
Linguo:	They *are* throwing robots.
Legs:	He's disrespecting us.  [to Linguo] Shut up you face!
Linguo:	Shut up *your* face.
Legs:	Whassamatta, you?
Louie:	You ain't so big.
Legs:	Me and him are going to whack you in the labonzza!
Linguo:	Bad ... gad grammar overload -- error, error!
-- Yeah, what he said, "Trilogy of Error"

% Linguo, who could really use a better error-handling mechanism,
% throws sparks.  Some of them land on Bart's fireworks bag, setting
% off an explosion that blasts Linguo to the high heavens.
%
% Meanwhile, at a trash can just outside of town, Linguo's head lands
% near Homer.
%
% Cut back to the alleyway.  There's a big scorch mark on the ground. 
% Fat Tony and his gang lie unconscious on the pavement.  Marge lifts
% the lid of the garbage can where Bart and Milhouse are hiding, and
% tells them they're safe now.  Homer runs up with his severed thumb
% and Linguo's head.

Homer:	Oh, thank goodness everyone's okay.
Marge:	Except your thumb, and Lisa's science project.
Tony:	[who has regained consciousness, and is being handcuffed 
	by Wiggum] I couldn't help but notice your respective 
	predicaments.  Perhaps I may offer a bipartite solution.
-- "Trilogy of Error"

% At school, Lisa presents a new, off-the-cuff project on severed
% digit re-attachment.  Legs demonstrates the principle by sewing
% Homer's thumb back on his hand.

Legs:	There you go.  Enjoy your thumb.
	[Homer wiggles his thumb, and it regains its normal color]
Lisa:	As the circulation returns, the subject prepares for a 
	long and painful recovery.
	[the class applauds]
	It's lucky for me that Legs is an experienced Mob doctor.
Tony:	He once pulled a slug out of my arm and inserted it into a 
	stoolie's brain.
Hoover:	That's a first-place science project Lisa.
Family:	Yay!
	[class applauds again]
Marge:	Boy this sure was one crazy day.  [Mr. Teeny jumps into 
	her arms] Right Mr. Teeny?  [he makes some chimp noises, 
	and the class laughs]
Teeny:	<This plot made no sense!  Tell the people!>
