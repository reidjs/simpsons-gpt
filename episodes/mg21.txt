    Voice credits:
        NANCY CARTWRIGHT as Bart
        YEARDLEY SMITH as Lisa

    Animation producer was Margot Pipkin.
    Animators were Wesley Archer and David Silverman.

    The credits list the casting director as BONNIE PIETILA rather
    than BONITA PIETILA.

    ... how Lisa gritted her teeth while she slammed the door shut?
        She also smiled broadly after the job was accomplished.

> Assorted comments and observations
===============================================================================
Brian Howard {bh} gives the timing for this short as 0:54, whereas the
syndication package contains a full minute of animation.  ``Nyeah
nyeah nyeah-nyeah nyeah!''

Lisa is seductively cute in the first act of this short.
