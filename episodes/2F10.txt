===============================================================================
Marge's timer appears out of thin air.  {dh}

Marge turns the timer the wrong way.  {th}

After Homer tries to make the timer go faster, it disappears.  {ddg}

Why doesn't Lisa remember a story only two years old?  (For the same
reason Bart doesn't, see 9F21.)  {ddg}

Maggie was already born when Homer took up his present job as Safety
Inspector.  (See episode 7G03.)  {dh}

Homer's calendar has "Dick Clark's birthday" on the 16th of some month,
but Dick Clark's birthday is November 30.  {ddg}

Burns' wastebasket appears out of thin air.  {ddg}

Homer's jacket is washed away by the tide, yet it appears in the next
scene dry when Homer picks it up.  {dh}

Homer and Marge don't make prints in the sand.  {dh}

Homer's shirt sprouts button holes.  {dh}

Conception couldn't have occurred "seconds later" as it takes a long
time for the spermatazoa to get to the fallopian tubes.  (Yes, I know it
was a premature ejaculation joke.  No flames, please.)  {th}

Homer's rag disappears.  {dh}

Moe used to wear a red apron in earlier episodes.  {dh}

It shouldn't have been dark in the house when Marge got home -- there is
still daylight outside.  {dh}

During the baby shower, it looks like the Simpson family portrait above
the fireplace has Maggie merely whited out.  {av}

Ruth Powers is at the baby shower, yet she didn't move to the
neighborhood until after Maggie was born.  {pch}

Marge's bag of groceries disappears from the hallway when the front door
blows open.  {dh}

The flashback where Marge tells Homer about Bart contradicts 8F10.

The flashback where Marge tells Homer about Lisa contradicts 9F08.

Homer runs up the stairs after hearing about Lisa, but there's a picture
of Lisa on the wall of the stairs.  {mw}

The picture of Maggie is eliminated from over the bed, but the picture
of Bart & Lisa remains over the left of the bed.  Shouldn't it be in the
middle?  {av}

There's a woman at the plant, contradicting 1F07 (where Burns is forced
to hire a woman), although 7F15 also shows a female plant worker.  {ddg}

When Marge goes into labor, there's a picture of Maggie on the wall over
her right shoulder!  {av}

Maggie sees Homer and Marge kissing and wants one as well, then she
grabs a pacifier and sucks on it - since when can newborns see, or have
the motor skills to reach and grab?  {ddg}

Homer is right-handed in this episode.  {dh}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Tony Hill: This was a superb episode!  IMO, the telephone gag was A-1.
    The self-references (can't go 1/2 hour without snack, the animation
    gag) are the kind which should be encouraged, as opposed to the less
    subtle ones in "Bart's Girlfriend."  To quote a Simpson, this
    episode was "perfectly balanced."  A+

Rod Arz: Tonight's episode was excellent, but the best was the whole bit
    with Knightboat (The crime _solving_ boat!) and Homer's "deals" with
    God.  Great episode.

Warren Hagey: Well, another hairstyle for Dr. Hibbert in a flashback
    makes this another good episode.  This one wasn't quite as good as
    'Lisa's First Word', but it was still very entertaining, and the
    different viewpoints for the storytelling were great, while Homer
    once again stole the show.  A-

Paul Pelkonen Tonight's episode pales next to the four other flashback
    episodes OFF have done...except for Dr. Hibbert's hair, there wasn't
    enough in the episode to give you a flavor of the times that they
    are describing.

Scott Fujimoto: This was one of the most laugh-free episodes for me this
    season.  Almost the jokes were either mistimed, too obvious, or just
    not funny.  OTOH, this episode had something that's been lacking
    recently, and that's a fully-developed PLOT.  Split Grade: Comedy
    Part: D+, Story Part: A

Aaron Varhola: Two weeks ago, an A episode, and now this?  The cutting
    was too fast to tell a coherent story, and (except for two gags),
    the gags seemed forced, too "Saturday Night Live"-ish.  Dumb Homer
    made an unwelcome appearance as well, but his "Awwww" fawning over
    Maggie at the end pulled it above "Fear of Flying".  C-/D+

Marc Singer: This episode was terrific, more like the character-driven
    stories of a while back.  And the 'non-sequitur' type gags were both
    funny and non-intrusive...the Bond opening, NightBoat, etc. had me
    rolling.  Dr. Hibbert had one of his best scenes (and haircuts)
    ever.

Vanessa Cameron: I'm not usually one to dump on OFF, but last night's
    episode was a real disappointment.  While it must be hard for the
    writers to contain the overpowering urge to play up Maggie's mind-
    boggling cuteness, I think they went a bit overboard.  I say it's
    the tackiest episode ever.  Not a real laugh grabber either.

John J. Wood: Now that's more like it -- a rock-solid episode loaded
    with great gags and Homer: The sperm scene alone goes alongside
    Under The Sea as a season highlight, and Burns' head as a bongo
    worked great as well.

Don Del Grande: A-minus ("of course Don would like this one; it's a
    Maggie episode") - this one was loaded with gags, but there's just
    something about a "sappy ending" that spoils it.

Scott Hollifield: Did anyone notice that the general tone of the comedy
    was decidedly *different* from what we're used to?  For the first
    time, I found myself actually noticing that the writing style was
    different: something I'll do from time to time on shows like Star
    Trek, but for the Simpsons, it's a first.

Bailey Irwin: First they did a great flashback episode about Homer and
    Marge meeting; then a very good one about Bart as an infant; then a
    fairly good one about Lisa as an infant; now a truly awful one about
    Maggie as an infant.  I'm going to start a collection so the writers
    can BUY an original damn idea!  GRADE: F.

Tara Ariano: This whole season, there has been at least one continuity
    error per episode, but this one was the worst, with at least six
    that I can think of offhand.  I laugh, but then I'm ashamed to have
    been sucked in when the jokes are so weak.

Matthew Kurth: The first time I ever turned off the TV and walked away
    during an episode.  Repetitive, expository, tired, predictable, and
    a waste of potential.  Not even the superb ending could save it.
    5/10

Yours truly: The episode had an odd feel to it, I assume due to the new
    writer, but the jokes were quite excellent.  Knightboat, Burns-
    bongo, Aaronson and Zykowski, Homer praying all great; Homer's
    competence at the bowling alley was refreshing.  Grade: B+.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> "Copacabana"

Tony Hill explains that the song, "written by Bruce Feldman, Jack
    Sussman, and Barry Manilow was a hit for Manilow in late 1978.  Some
    people thought it was an awful song.  They were right.  That didn't
    stop Manilow from doing a TV movie based on the song.  One OFF-
    related note: The movie contained an original song, `Ay Caramba!' by
    the same writers."

>> "The clear beverage craze"

Tony Hill notes that in early 1993, "Pepsi introduced Crystal Pepsi, a
    colorless drink based on the caramel-colored product of the same
    name.  (Those who tried it might differ.)  The product was a bomb,
    and Pepsi changed the formula less than a year later.  It has not
    been widely available since."

 Announcer: We now return to "Knightboat: the Crime-Solving Boat".
   Michael: Faster, Knightboat!  We gotta catch those starfish poachers.
Knightboat: You don't have to yell, Michael, I'm all around you.
   Michael: Oh, no!  They're headed for land.

   Michael: We'll never catch them now.
Knightboat: Incorrect: look!  A canal.
     Homer: Go, Knightboat, go!
      Bart: Oh, every week there's a canal.
      Lisa: Or an inlet.
      Bart: Or a fjord.
     Homer: Quiet!  I will not hear another word against the boat.

% Marge walks in.

Marge: OK, TV off.  It's family time.
Homer: Oh, but Marge!  Knightboat, the _crime-solving_ boat.
Marge: Homer, you promised.  One night of family time a week -- besides,
       that backtalking boat sets a bad example.
 Bart: Says you, woman.
-- Marge, right yet again, "And Maggie Makes Three"

% Marge turns the TV off amidst groans.

Marge: All right, family time begins now.

    Homer: [as Marge opens it] So many memories.  Aw, look --
           Knightboat.
Bart+Lisa: Aww...
    Homer: And _here's_ our TV next to the mirror!  It looks like we
           have two.
Bart+Lisa: Wow, two!
    Marge: Yeah, yeah, yeah, two.  Let's get to the baby pictures.
Bart+Lisa: Aw, Mom!
    Homer: [sarcastic] Oh, yeah, _that's_ exciting.

% of her castle.

           [looking at the photo album]
    Marge: Here's Bart sleeping.  Here he is dozing...here he is after a
           visit from the sandman.  Ooh, here's nappy time, Bart!
           Here's a cute one: he's all tuckered out.
     Lisa: Why aren't there any pictures of Maggie?
            [Maggie looks worried]
    Homer: Well I'm _glad_ you asked.  It's actually a very interesting
           story.
Bart+Lisa: [groaning] Oh...
    Homer: It all began about two years ago before Maggie was even born.
           {Bart, you were Lisa's age and Lisa, you were...the age Bart
           was several years ago.}
     Bart: {Get the camera ready, Bart very sleepy...[yawns]}
-- Photo ops, "And Maggie Makes Three"

    Homer: {Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as
           any TV show.}  It was a tumultuous time for our nation: the
           clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.  The
           information superhighway showed the average person what some
           nerd thinks about Star Trek.  And the domestication of the
           dog continued unabated.
            [flash to Homer at work]
           I was at my work station when suddenly --
            [a voice comes over the PA]
Terrorist: Attention American workers: your plant has been taken over by
           an all-star team of freelance terrorists.
            [the lights go off; the emergency lighting comes on]
    Homer: Not on _my_ shift!  [jumps into an overhead vent]
            [in Burns' office, terrorists prepare to kill bound and
           gagged Lenny, Burns, and Carl]

          healthy man can make that kind of smell.
Smithers: [walking in] Your paychecks, gentlemen.
   Homer: [opening his] Woo hoo!  This is it: with this single, glorious
          check, I'm finally completely out of debt!  [he checks a
          calendar with the 18th circled: "Out of debt here"]
          Yes!  With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy
          job.
   Lenny: But Homer, how are you going to make a living?
   Homer: Don't worry about Homer J., I've got a plan.  [menacing] A
          plan that'll fix you good...

Hibbert: Congratulations, Mrs. Simpson: you're pregnant.
  Marge: Mmm...
Hibbert: Am I to take it that this is [chuckles] an unwanted pregnancy?
  Marge: Oh, no, no, not exactly.  It's just that I haven't told Homer
         yet, and with his new job, I don't know how we're going to be
         able to afford this.
Hibbert: Well, you know a healthy baby can bring upwards of $60,000.
  Marge: What?!

       absolutely perfect just the way it is.
Marge: Mmm.
Homer: So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't
       ask for anything more.  If that is OK, please give me absolutely
       no sign.  [brief pause] OK, deal.

Homer: Yeah, a raise.  I've never been good enough at any job to deserve
       one before, but I'm damn good at this one.  That's it: I'm going
       to march right up to Al and say --
        [at the alley]
Homer: Steve!  I mean, Al!  I think I deserve a raise.
   Al: Aw, you're a hard worker, and I'd like to give you a raise, but

          failed.  Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I'd ever
          done.
      Al: You did a great job, Homer, and I'm really going to miss you.
          The place has never been cleaner, and the way you kept the
