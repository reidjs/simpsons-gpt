        1 arriving at the TV room.
        1 when she tricks Ms. Botz into following her.
        1 at the telephone booth.

>> What Homer usually has at Moe's{dh}:
      A quick one, some peanuts, hunk of beef jerky, a couple pickled eggs.

>> The Unabridged Oliver Wendell Holmes

Bart's blackboard punishment references a series of cases from 1917, most
notably Schenck v. US.  Schenck was convicted of violating the Espionage Act,
which made it illegal to ``obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service.''
In his ruling, Justice Holmes wrote:

	The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in
	falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.

This is the first time that the First Amendment had really been limited.  All
other limitations on that amendment stem from this.

>> Save money!  Make your season premiere the season finale!

Although this episode is the first in the production series, it was not aired
until the end of the season.  This was due to the fact that the production team
was just getting used to creating full-length episodes, and so there were a few
innocent mistakes.  Like including an ulttraviolent clip from a show and making
the family look like demons.  Matt Groening balked and sent it to be
reanimated.  As a result, it wound up last in the production series.

This makes for an interesting chronology:

The series pilot was ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire'' [7G08], which aired
on 12/17/89, but the series proper didn't begin until 1/14/90, with ``Bart the
Genius,'' yet the first episode to be produced wasn't aired until 5/13.  Phew!
Got that?

>> But they didn't DO anything!

Because this episode wasn't aired in chronological order, the couch gag makes
even (more/less) sense.  Obviously, it was intended that this gag was going to
be ``normal,'' and the others were variations.  The result that they got was
just the opposite.  According to one fan (Jessi Cuellar):

	When ``Some Enchanted Evening'' aired here a few months ago, my 3 year
	old son and I were watching.  After the couch scene, he laughed, and I
	asked him what was funny, and he said ``They didn't do anything.'' Not
	really relevant, but I am so proud.

>> Misc., &c.

   Dave Hall notes: Marge states they have a video library, yet we never get
   to see this video library anywhere in the whole series?

   Homer & Marge supposedly had rushed home, yet they have taken the time
   to get completely dressed.{dh}
   [Probably keeping up appearances for the kids -aag]

===============================================================================
>Animation, Continuity, and Other Goofs
===============================================================================
= Various items from the kitchen move/disappear from the overhead shot.{hw}

= The amount of pickled eggs changes (between shots) from 12, to 10, to 15!{hw}

= When the kids ask Marge for some ``grub'' it's about 9:37 PM.  After Marge
  has scared off her children and continues to wait for Homer, it's about 8:32
  PM.  Then when (and just before) Marge is hallucinating, the clock reads
  just past 6:30 PM.{hw}

= When Bart makes a prank call to Moes from the kitchen, the telephone is
  different than it was in the ep's opening scene. 
  [it changes <again> from the side view.]{hw}

= Marge's nose is drawn very oddly during the scene of her prettying herself up
  in front of the mirror.{hw}

= The doorknob on OFF's front door changes color between shots.{hw}

= On the first shot of ``The Larry Davis Experience,'' we see the drummer
  hitting a cymbal and a tom-tom drum, yet all we hear is the cymbal.{hw}

= When Maggie comes into the TV room where Bart and Lisa are tied up, on the
  ``Happy Little Elves'' the bear-cub-in-the-honey scene is recycled, but then
  from a different shot the ending appears on the screen.{hw}

= Miss Botz's vehicle changes from scene to scene.{hw}

  Ms. Botzcowski's car was should have been intercepted by the police that
  came from the other direction.  Note that she left only second(s) before
  the police arrival.

* The check out time for the Off-Ramp Inn is either 4 or 9 a.m.{dh}

= An unknown hand removes the carton of milk from the kitchen table.{dh}

= The kitchen chairs appear to be knocked over in some scenes.{dh}

= Homer is watching stuff coming down a conveyor belt, yet his station
  starts at the very beginning of the conveyor belt.{dh}

= The contents of Barney's beer mug vanish.{dh}

= Homer's wristwatch goes missing from his hand in the shot of him standing
  outside the house.{dh}

= The candy box and rose in Homer's hands switches places.{dh}

= Homer's rose appears to have been mishandled, yet it appears pristine when
  Marge is holding it.{dh}

= Marge's earrings goes missing in one scene after Marge just put them on.{dh}

= Marge produces the video tape out of thin air.{dh}

= The kids were in the hallway, yet the scene of Homer and Marge leaving
  the house depicts an empty hallway.{dh}

= The cover of the Video tape disappears.{dh}

= Bart shoves the video tape upside down into the VCR.{dh}

= Marge leaves the house without her purse, yet she has it at the
  restaurant.{dh}

= Intercutting scenes depict Bart and Lisa's feet as dangling or not
  dangling over the couch cushions.{dh}

= After Bart falls from the cupboard, there shouldn't be a shadow on Ms.
  Botz and him.{dh}

= Homer somehow manages to unlock and open the suite door while holding
  Marge in his arms.{dh}

= Marge's head was to the right of Homer when he threw her so Marge should
  have landed on the bed with her head to the right.{dh}

* Since we haven't seen Marge with a purse at the hotel suite, there really
  isn't anyway for her to bring a change of clothing.{dh}

= TV/VCR remote isn't seen in TV room when Maggie enters the room.{dh}

= Homer & Marge's bedroom door opens inwards, yet the door opens outwards
  when Ms. Botz leaves the room.{dh}

* Homer couldn't have helped Ms. Botz with the suitcases if the suitcases
  were still on the floor of Homer & Marge's bedroom -- amongst the mess
  Ms. Botz made in her quest for `Samson' goodies.{dh}

*  Possible Plot-hole:
      Where is Homer's car while he stood in front of the house?  If the car
      were in the garage then Homer should have used the garage door
      entrance.{dh}

% Breakfast at the Simpsons.  Homer and the kids chow down while Marge watches,
% standing and sipping her coffee.  The radio is tuned to the KBBL traffic
% report.

Bad news, drivers.  There's an overturned melon truck on the interstate.
Oh, it's a mess.  There's lots of rubber-necking and melon wrestling
going on, folks...
-- Bill Pie ``in the Sky'', KBBL traffic report, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Homer reaches for the milk, revealing a box of ``Yummy Donuts''.  Bart
% and Lisa struggle for custody of the box (Maggie's eyes watch the
% back-and-forth) until the donut pops out of the box, bounces off Homer's
% head, and lands on his plate.  Homer inhales the pastry.
%
% The school bus honks its horn, and the kids head out.  Marge holds up two
% lunchboxes:  ``You forgot the special lunches I made.''  Bart and Lisa
% help themselves to Marge's purse.  ``That's okay, Mom!'' responds Bart.
% ``We got money!'' finishes Lisa as she replaces the purse in Marge's
% pocketbook.  Marge's protest is interrupted by a ``Yaaaargh!'' from
% Homer as he glances at his watch and gets up.  Marge closes her eyes
% for a kiss, but Homer takes and drinks her coffee then leaves.
%
% Overhead shot of the kitchen wreckage.  ``Well, Maggie, it's just you

       Marge, tonight, the second he comes through that front door, you've got
       to tell him you're fed up, and if he doesn't start loving you,
       you will be leaving.

% At the restaurant, Homer checks out the lobster tank and chooses...
% the one floating upside-down at the top.
%
% Bart suffers through the Happy Little Elves...

Bart: [watching a Happy Little Elves tape] Oh, man, I can't take it any more!
Lisa: But I want to see what happens.
Bart: You <know> what happens.  They find Captain Quick's treasure.
      All the elves dance around like little green idiots.  I puke.  The End.
Lisa: Bart, you're just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love.
-- ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Bart switches to ``America's Most Armed and Dangerous'', though Lisa
% finds the show too scary.

The Cue-ball Killer should be considered extremely armed and dangerous.
If you think you've seen him, call 1-800-U-SQUEAL.
-- ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% At the restaurant, the bubbly stops flowing, so Homer orders another bottle
% of their second-cheapest champagne.
%
% Back at the house...

The defenseless youngsters were tied up and gagged in the living
room, while the bandit roamed the house at will,
[TV pans over an empty house]
stealing the valuable objects it took the family a lifetime to shop for!
-- Watching `America's Most Armed and Dangerous', ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% To the music of the Larry Davis Experience, Homer and Marge mambo divinely.
%
% Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa watch more of America's Most Armed and Dangerous,
% and as the description of the Babysitter Bandit continues, they become
% increasingly frightened.  ``In a moment, we will show you a picture of the
% real Babysitter Bandit, Miss Lucille Botzcowski [pron. /botzokowsky/],
% and remember... she may be using a clever alias.''  A picture of Ms. Botz
% appears on the screen, and the kids scream.  Ms. Botz appears, carrying
% a length of rope.  Bart and Lisa: ``Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
% aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
% aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
% aaaaaaaaaa!''  Thunder roars outside.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:23]
%
% The kids make a run for it.  Bart ducks into the basement.  Lisa skids
% (cartoon style) into the kitchen and grabs the phone.  But she gets a
% busy signal.  Meanwhile, Homer and Marge are on the highway looking for
% Ye Olde Offramp Inn.  They spot it, but miss the exit.  ``No problemo,''
% says Homer.  ``We'll just get off at the next exit.''  A sign reads,
% ``Next Exit 34 Miles.''
%
% Ms. Botz descends into the basement looking for Bart.  While searching,
% she finds a cabinet of pickled beets and helps herself.  Atop the
% cabinet is Bart and a bowling ball.  Bart tries to roll the ball onto
% Ms. Botz, but he loses his balance and falls.

Seeing as no one was hurt, I think it would be really silly to dwell on this.
-- Bart to The Babysitter Bandit, after a failed capture attempt,
   ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Meanwhile, Lisa hides under the kitchen table and finally gets through.
% As she talks, she is dragged by the phone cord out from under the table.
% By Ms. Botz.  Oops.
%
% Homer carries Marge across the threshold, stumbles, and trips, tossing Marge
% (``Wheeeee!!'') onto the waterbed, where she relaxes, while Homer  rubs his 
% knee.
%
% Back at home, Ms. Botz has finished tying up Bart and Lisa...

Bart: We know who you are, Ms. Botz.  Or should I say, Ms. Botzcowski.
      You're the Babysitter Bandit.
Ms.B: You're a smart young man, Bart.  I hope you're smart enough to keep
      your mouth shut.
Lisa: He isn't.
-- A little knowledge, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% ... disables the phones, tapes Bart's mouth shut, and leaves them on the
% couch to suffer through The Happy Little Elves.  Bart protests, but Lisa
% says, ``Quiet, Bart!  Let's make the best of this.''
%
% At the motel, Marge offers to go ``slip into something more comfortable'',
% and Homer hopes it's the blue thing with the... things.
%
% Maggie wakes up and grabs the mobile above her crib, which she uses as a
% trapeze, landing in a pile of stuffed animals.  She spots Ms. Botz in the
% hallway, relieving the closet of its valuables (and some unvaluables).
% Maggie then wanders downstairs and spots her elder siblings, as well as
% the Happy Little Elves.  She decides to watch the Elves.
%
% The movie ends, and Maggie tries to turn off the TV with the remote control.
% Lisa asks, ``Wanna watch the Happy Little Elves again?''  Maggie nods.
% ``But ya hafta untie me, first.''  Maggie does so.
%
% ``Oh... Homer...'' calls Marge seductively.  She's indeed wearing the blue
% thing with the... things.  Homer gives one of his lustful, ``Ohhhhh...''s.
%
% Ms. Botz continues her pillaging and spots Maggie walking through the
% hallway.  She follows the sound of the sucking, which leads her into
% a dark room.  (*whump*)  The lights come on.  Bart (sucking on Maggie's
% pacifier) has clobbered her with a baseball bat.
%
% Homer and Marge relax in the waterbed, and Marge decides to check up on
% things at home.  There is no answer because Bart, Lisa, and Maggie
% (clutching Bart's neck like a knapsack) have escaped out the window.
% The kids call from a pay phone.  (Bart goes down on all fours so Lisa
% can stand on his back to reach the phone.)

Operator: Hello, vigilant viewer.  How may we help you?
Lisa: We caught her!  We caught the Babysitter Bandit!  She's tied up
      at our house right now!
Bart: Ask if there's a reward.
Lisa: Is there a reward? ... [to Bart] If she's convicted, we get T-shirts.
Bart: Yeah!
-- Calling America's Most Armed and Dangerous, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Homer and Marge return home to find Ms. Botz bound and gagged, being forced
% to watch, yes, The Happy Little Elves.  Homer and Marge untie her and
% apologize profusely.  Ms. Botz's first words:  ``Please turn off the TV.''
%
% Homer helps Ms. Botz with her luggage (``Oh, these things are heavy!'')
% and pays her triple the rate, just so there are no hard feelings.

Ms.Botz: Mr. Samson, can I give you a bit of advice?
Homer:   Sure.
Ms.Botz: Don't turn your back on that boy for a second.
-- Words of warning from the Babysitter Bandit, ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Ms. Botz speeds off just before Homer is surrounded by police cars.
% Bart explains that they left her tied up in the house, but Homer snags
% him and scolds, ``I just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off
% so that...''  Microphones are shoved in his face.  A reporter asks,
% ``Are you telling the world that you just aided and abetted the escape
% of the notorious Babysitter Bandit?''  Homer fumbles, ``Actually, it
% was quite a struggle!''
%
% Homer and Marge watch the news.  The caption reads, ``Homer Simpson,
% local boob.''  TV-Homer says, ``Have you ever seen a kung-fu movie?
% It was just like that!''
%
% Homer shuts off the TV.

Homer: Lord help me, I'm just not that bright.
Marge: Oh, Homer, don't say that.  The way I see it, you raised three
       children who could knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger,
       you must be doing <something> right.
-- ``Some Enchanted Evening''

% Homer thinks...  ``Yeah!'' and the two kiss as Marge turns off the lights.
% Homer asks, ``Can we make up again?''   Responds Marge, ``Oh, my goodness!''
