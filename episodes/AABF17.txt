> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [Canadian TV Guide] Mr. Burns isn't feeling so "excellent" when another
   billionaire struts into town and showers goodwill upon the lower class, so
   Monty enlists Homer as his image consultant and winds up on a shock-jock's
   radio show.  {hl}

Blackboard:     I HAVE NEITHER BEEN THERE / NOR DONE THAT

Couch:          The family run on and do a chorus line.  They're joined by a
                line of Rockette-type women.  As the camera pulls back, the
                back wall of the living room is lifted up to reveal elephants
                doing handstands on one front leg, magicians pulling rabbits
                out of hats, and other assorted circus performers.  The music
                throughout sounds as though it's from a circus.  [Recycled

   and the store is not that busy -- how come those idiot people are simply
   standing around outside the building?  {dh}

*  "Fortune Megastore" is presumably based on "Virgin Megastore", yet a Virgin
   Megastore only carries music and videos (well, there's also Virgin Cola
   machines and the occasional Virgin Airways office).  {ddg}

=  The scene first shown from The Postman clip shows bare telephone poles,
   when Lisa selects director commentary cables are dangling from the
   telephone poles.  {dh}

*  A "director's commentary" track on a DVD does not put the director's image

   end of the scene, the notepad and pen reappear.  {dh}

+  Burns is left-handed.  (See 7F23.)  {dh}

*  If Homer didn't know the hospital was naming a wing after him, why did he

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Nathan DeHoff:  This is the first Burns episode in some time, but,
   unfortunately, it's not a very good episode.  Burns's attempts to be loved
   really aren't all that funny, and too much emphasis is placed on violent or
   gory bits [...] and dumb sight gags.  The Howard Stern take-off wasn't much
   of a parody, and the Loch Ness monster bit came out of nowhere, and had a
   weak resolution.  Also, speaking of weak resolutions, Arthur Fortune pretty
   much disappears after providing a catalyst for the plot.  Some of the more
   absurd bits, such as Burns's cow-catcher, the shoplifting department,
   Frink's frog exaggerator, and Burns's unexplained overpowering of Nessie,
   were pretty funny, but the episode was quite weak overall.  Grade:  (D)

Yuri Dieujuste:  Poor execution and a lack of funny jokes has caused this
   episode to implode on itself.  A poor plot line does not help either.  I
   guess the writers can not write a Burns episode correctly any more.  Grade
   4.0/10.0  (F)

Jordan Eisenberg:  It'd be great if the staff finally decided to do more than
   just a handful of Mr. Burns scenes each year, but if they continue to write
   for him as poorly as they've been doing for the past two seasons, this may
   be the very way to go. Aside from Burns himself, the plot wasn't all that
   creative, the jokes weren't all that funny or unpredictable, and a lot of
   it just seemed stupid.  At least I found everything _before_ Mr. Burns'
   first appearance pretty funny (especially the "shoplifting department"),
   and the "King Kong" twist was a nice touch.  (D+)

Alexei S. Esikoff:  The first act seemed very promising ... back in old
   Simpsons territory. But after that ... Where did Smithers go?  Where did
   Fortune go?  Where did Bart, Lisa, and Marge go?  There were some good
   gags, especially Willy's parents.  And Homer was in good form, not a
   jerkass.  His last bit of dialogue with Burns was true to both characters.
   But it could have been better.  The beginning had so much potential to veer
   off in a number of satiric directions --shots at big business or the
   strange lives of billionaires.  I wish Fortune stayed around and he and
   Burns actually became rivals.  He would have been an interesting character
   to develop.  The Nessie stuff was just silly ... besides, we all know the
   Loch Ness monster doesn't really exist, right?  Right?  (B-)

Joe Green:  Much better than what I was expecting (judging from those lame Fox
   promos).  It was nice to see an episode that didn't rely on cheap laughs
   about Homer's stupidity/obnoxiuousness.  It looks like Swartzwelder is back
   on top after a string of episodes that ranged from uneven to mediocre.  (A)

Dan Hogg:  Uh ... okay.  The first act was all right, but I thought the
   episode would have more about Arthur Fortune after that.  Instead we got a
   kind of weak plot (Mr. Burns wants to be loved).  And, come on, we are all
   so sick of seeing Homer involved in the story, even if he wasn't the main
   character this time.  The Jerry Rude bit was funny, as was Homer with the
   oversized check.  However, I could see the joke w/the silver dollars from a
   mile away, and that Lenny & Carl scene afterwards was uncalled for.  The
   Loch Ness bit was completely also far-fetched.  And whatever happened to
   that Megastore, anyway?  (C-)

Carl Johnson:  Another episode that could have been written by four-year olds.
   The overabundance of tasteless jokes, plus the whole thing about Nessie
   destroyed what could have been a great "rivalry" episode.  The billionaire
   in question disappeared within 5 minutes, and Mr. Burns's schemes fell way
   flat.  Highlights were the description of the bad billionaire, and Homer's
   saying, "To be liked you have to go out and do things, but to be hated you
   don't have to do squat." That's (sadly) the best Simpsons saying of 1999, a
   pretty fine axiom.  I suppose the irony this season is this: The chalkboard
   gags are great.  Couch gags, never been better.  Plots, full of potential,
   hope.  The show sucks.  Weird.  [...] Sadly, this isn't anywhere near the
   worst episode this season.  (B-)

Darrel Jones:  The best episode in some time.  Great to see Burns being
   himself.  In fact, great to see Burns period.  The plot was wonderfully
   done, and got delightfully wacky during Act Three (especially the ending).
   The only bad part was the grotesque humor after Lenny got hit by a silver
   dollar.  An 8/10.  (A-)

Joe Klemm:  A fun episode for one that is centered around Mr. Burns.  Sure
   everyone will probably consider this a wacky Homer episode, but this is
   more specifically a Mr. Burns episode.  The plot was well set up, and the
   Loch Ness bit was able to be good for the spoiler that was on the page even
   in just one act.  However, I'm wondering what's the deal with the TV-14
   rating, since this is normal for a Simpsons episode.  (B)

Haynes Lee:  A lot like the "Trouble With Trillions."  This show would have
   been a lot better with more Arthur Fortune or Gerry Rude (if Fox censors
   would have allowed it).  (C-)

Jake Lennington:  Welll, it certainly was a mixed bag.  Homer wasn't as
   asinine as much and we got to see a lot of Monty.  The BIG downer of this
   episode was the coin-to-the head w/Lenny.  That was not funny and it was in
   bad taste.  "Oh my god, they injured Lenny!"  (B)

Andrew Levine:  The first two acts were dull and not very funny.  The final
   act had much better jokes, although I thought that the bit with the monster
   was quite cartoonish.  This episode lacked Mr. Burns' anachronistic
   references that enliven his' character (and made "Homer the Smithers" such
   an enjoyable episode).  Overall there was too much lowbrow and forced
   humor.  (C)

Ondre Lombard:  This episode was entertaining and funny and semi-different, as
   it revolved around Mr. Burns for once caring whether or not people like him
   or not.  It went well until the plot decided to take the most absurd turn
   in Act Three and start the characters on a journey for the Loch Ness
   Monster. Consequently, act three bored me for the most part, with only two
   good parts: Homer for once indicating that he has an appreciation for
   courtesy, and Homer in the kilt.  Another low point for this episode was
   Lenny and the coin, which was as bad as the sliced arm gag in Realty Bites.
   (C)

Patrick McGovern:  Hmmm ... I anticipated this a LOT, but it didn't live up to
   expectations. However, it still wasn't bad at all, and definitely not as
   bad as some curmudgeons here have said.  There are tons of great gags: The
   population of Loch Ness, Burns destroying himself King Kong style, and
   every scene featuring Richard Bran ... err, Arthur Fortune and Gerry Rude.
   Of course, the third act was just painful at times, mainly the nonsensical
   very end.  A subplot here would've done wonders.  And as a side note,
   Michael McKean does a GREAT Howard Stern voice!  (B-)

Tom Rinschler:  As Burns himself said, "That didn't go well".  The plot was
   disjointed and jumpy, as if they had three different stories and attempted
   to patch them together as best as possible, and then did a poor job of it.
   (A better story line would have Burns and Fortune attempting to
   outlandishly outspend each other, until a wily Burns caused Fortune to
   spend himself into poverty.)  At least there were a few good jokes to keep
   this from being a complete flop.  (C-)

Jason Rosenbaum:  Despite having the best quote of the season ("I'm not even
   that easily impressed ... ooh!  A blue car!"), this episode totally missed
   the mark.  The beginning stunk, the overall plot wasn't that interesting,
   and the ending was a bit nonsensical.  Although it didn't demolish Burn's
   character like in "The Old Man And Lisa," it didn't help it either.  (D+)

S. J. Treano:  The episode started well, and had a few good gags, but almost
   everything after (and including) "A Sober Irishman?" just sucked. And the
   idea of finding the Loch Ness Monster was one of the silliest things that
   has been done on the Simpsons, because it crossed that line from realistic
   animated sitcom to zany, out-of-this-world cartoon. However there were good
   moments like "Wow!  A Blue Car!", so it gets a:  (C)

Yours Truly:  Fortunately, this show has a great concept:  Burns tries to
   improve his public image.  Unfortunately, this show has a not-so-great
   execution.  Burns makes the weird decision to enlist Homer's help, and
   Homer makes the equally weird decision to give that help.  Also, the tone
   was too off-the-wall for my preference.  Fortunately, the show does have
   some good moments, especially in the first act.  Don't miss the sound bite
   when the Gracie Logo appears; it's one of the funniest moments of the show.

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> This program was exceedingly graphic and should not have been viewed by young children

In the United States, this episode was broadcast with a rating of TV-14-DL,
   indicating the show has some content that perhaps should not be viewed by
   young children.  This is more "restrictive" than the show's usual rating of
   TV-PG.  (I put "restrictive" in quotes because there's nothing preventing
   anyone from watching, regardless of age.)  Some members of
   <alt.tv.simpsons> guessed at what triggered the new rating.


Aaron Matthews starts by wondering:  Since when is it TV-14?


Gary Wilson answers:  Since Lenny gets impaled by a silver dollar and spurts
   blood all of the place, I suppose.


Sarah Culp:  I assumed it was due to parts of the radio show segment.


"shep9882":  I thought it was what was under Homer's kilt.


Ellen Cohen:  Don't forget Burns' wiener-swallowing.


Todd Emerson:  I'm guessing that the whole rating for tonight's show was based
   solely on the banter between Monty and the Howard Sternesque shock jock on
   KBBL.  The L is for language, and I believe the D is for dialogue.  I could
   be wrong, though.  Little help, here!


Don Del Grande:  My guess is for Burns saying "farting".  Note that while this
   episode is rated TV-14, the episode of "Family Guy" that originally
   followed it was only rated TV-PG.


Ondre Lombard adds:  That and perhaps the Rude DJ asking Mr. Burns how long
   his genital is. (the word "penis" or any reference to it tends to give any
   Fox show an instant TV-14 rating.)

   I find this sort of peculiar considering Natural Born Kissers came inches
   away from showing The Full Monty for both Homer and Marge.  I suppose since
   there weren't jokes like "How long is your wiener?" it was able to slide
   by.  *shrug*  Does nothing but prove how arbitrary and useless the TV
   ratings are.


Eric Sansoni:  I'm sure it was the Howard Stern-esque scene which caused the
   rating.  IMO this is totally justified.  It's not the depiction of sex
   which I feel should be offensive, but the way it's depicted.  The crass way
   Stern handles it is clearly much more unhealthy for younger viewers than
   simply seeing a mom and dad type get affectionate, in the entirely innocent
   way they did in Natural Born Kissers. NBK is one of the most innocent
   depictions of sexual material I've ever seen on television, which is why I
   found it utterly charming.  By contrast the Stern parody was almost
   offensive even to me who often enjoys the real Stern show. This was
   virtually a direct copy of the grossest stuff Stern's ever done.


>> If it's good once, it'll be good five times

Mike Smith notes:  It [the "chorus line" couch gag] is first used in "Lisa's
   First Word" (Aired December 3, 1992)and then, used again in "I Love Lisa",
   "The Front", "Cape Feare", and "Fear Of Flying" (Not to mentioned "The
   138th Episode Spectacular").


>> Musical Reference

David Puckett somewhat breathlessly relates:  I've looked through the capsule
   submissions that have been posted so far (and the replies to them) and so
   far, no one has mentioned yet that the song that was playing during Arthur
   Fortune's little entrance was Alice Cooper's "Billion Dollar Babies."  I
   thought this was pretty cool, coming right on the heels of Alice's new box
   set [POORLY VEILED PLUG].

   I'm guessing it was the original studio version, including Glen Buxton et.
   al. (although it's kind of hard to tell on my pathetic television
   speakers).  Man were they ever one tight band!  [STILL MORE POORLY VEILED
   PLUG].  If you don't believe me, go out and buy the new box set, "The Life
   and Crimes of Alice Cooper", available in music stores of taste everywhere!
   [SHAMELESS BLATANT PLUG]

   ["Huh?  Who is Alice Cooper?" -- Mark J. Finegold]


Todd Emerson adds:  Two METAL songs [appear] in tonight's episode:  "Living
   After Midnight" by Judas Priest, and "Billion Dollar Babies" by Alice
   Cooper.  Coincidence that these would appear on the same episode guest-
   starring Michael McKean, a.k.a. David St. Hubbins of the world's loudest
   metal band, Spinal Tap?  Hmmm ...


>> Huh?  Who is Judas Priest?

Haynes Lee:  Judas Priest [was a] heavy metal band from the 1980s


Todd Emerson:  Actually, their first album was released in 1973 (and they're
   currently in the studio preparing another one!  Rock on!).  Unlike their
   native England, they didn't achieve any real mainstream success in the
   States until the '80s, though.


>> "Ooh, I heard this really sucks!"

Joe Klemm:  "The Postman" is a 1997 bomb starring Kevin Costner as post-
   apocalyptic man who attempts to restart the U.S. by restarting the postal
   service.  However, the plot, written by the same guy who wrote the same
   script as "L.A. Confidential," was awful, and the high-budget film was
   running the same time as "Titanic."  As a result, the film bombed and it
   became a real stinker that even the writer regretted doing.


Speaking of whom, Jeff Cross names the writer, and elaborates on "The
   Postman's" undoing:  "The Postman" by David Brin was one of those patriotic
   post-apocalypse novels that hounded the eighties; this one was about a
   drifter who poses as a mailman after the fall of the US and pretends that
   the government is back in business.  The Kevin Costner movie didn't even
   break even and only lasted three weeks in the theaters.  My theories as to
   the causes of such a lackluster draw are

   1) It was up against "Titanic," which was giving all other films at the
   time the Microsoft competitors' rush to video.

   2) The trailers for the film gave it the appearance that it was a huge rock
   'n' roll action flick, but it dragged and seemed more like an anti-militia
   remake of "Dances With Wolves."

   3) Sir Thomas More said "Patriotism is a virtue of the wicked."  In the
   post-Vietnam world, it's become politically incorrect to stand up and fight
   for your country.


>> A bad penny always returns

So, how do we *know* Bart's penny was minted in Philadelphia?  Don Del Grande
   explains:  The lack of mint mark below the date means it's a Philadelphia
   penny; "D" would indicate Denver and "S" San Francisco, although the San
   Francisco mint hasn't made any general circulation coins in years.


>> The lovable billionaire

Benjamin Robinson:  That would be Richard Branson of Virgin [insert name of
   enterprise here].  Branson is young(ish), brash, and personable, all of
   which most CEO's aren't.  In the business world, his interests range from
   high-visibility industries like music and movie production, to slightly
   more mundane businesses like air transport and media retailing, to offbeat
   ones like air tours in vintage airplanes. Outside the office, Branson
   pursued a range of flamboyant activities, most recently attempting to
   become the first man to fly around the world on a balloon.  He didn't make
   it, and after a few expensive rescue attempts some critics began wondering
   if maybe he should take up stamp collecting or something for a hobby.
   Perhaps Monty should have waited for something similar to happen to Arthur
   Fortune.


Andrew Gill provides more information about the ballooning angle:  Most every
   aviation feat has been broken years ago.  Most, that is, except one small
   little feat in ballooning.  Until just a few weeks ago, no man had ever
   circumnavigated the globe in a hot-air balloon. The reasons had been
   largely political (Libya and China sometimes refused to let people cross
   their airspace), rather than technical. One of the favorites to break the
   record was the C.E.O. of Virgin Enterprises, who seems to be the model for
   Mr. Fortune.


David Zahnd:  In defense of the Chinese (they are, after all paying for my
   car), arranging these balloon flights requires rerouting of commercial
   domestic and international air traffic.  In a country like China, that is
   enough aviation over a large enough area to be a legitimate pain in the
   butt, for the Western Capitalist Swine playing with their billions.


Speaking of billionaires, Benjamin Robinson goes on to say:  Adam Sandler is a
   former "Saturday Night Live" alum who has made it big with movies like "The
   Wedding Singer."  He's widely castigated by movie critics for making really
   dumb movies, but he's laughing all the way to the bank.


>> Ach, it'll take more than that to kill a Scotsman!

In "I Love Lisa (9F13)," Willie said his father was hanged.  Many people
   noticed how he seemed to have come back from the dead just for this
   episode.


David Brunt takes a stab at explaining this inconsistency:  It's historically
   proven that someone can be hanged for a limited time and still survive if
   released.  I think it's around a minute or two - though it depends on the
   windpipe not being crushed by a rope.

   There was supposedly an olde clause that if a person was not killed by
   hanging, they were pardoned.  Hence the rumours of prisoners putting metal
   rods and the like in their windpipe to protect it from being crushed.

   In any case, hanging was outlawed in Britain in the mid-1960s.  Unless
   Willie's father was hanged before then (or in another country, 'bogs'
   probably refer more to Ireland than Scotland - but the *no hanging*
   legislation still covers that), it's a writing error.  I hope somebody was
   ... Oh, who cares!


Andrew Gill writes:  That's lynching.  Hanging snaps the neck.  Instantly.
   Lynching asphyxiates the person.  The few states that still allow execution
   by hanging have to make sure that the rope's not too short, or the person
   will slowly die over minutes.  They also have to make sure that the rope
   isn't too long, or else the head will be torn off, according to one source
   (very theatrical, possibly true, but I wouldn't quote me on it).


David Brunt:  I knew there was *another* reason for the metal bar in the
   throat - it stopped the neck being snapped.  Think about it - the throat is
   solid, the neck can't bend and snap under the pressure of the rope.  So, my
   earlier posting was correct.  In a way ... I see your point though.

   I recall that when the 'Official Hangman' retired (what a title to have!!),
   the papers over here ran his memoirs.  He did mention the bar trick, plus
   the long/short rope story.  So, I suppose they must be true.


Meanwhile, Tom Rinschler has another theory:  Maybe Willie's mother married
   her late husband's (twin?) brother, who subsequently raised the boy, and
   was henceforth fondly remembered by the grateful boy as his father.


>> Here Nessie, Nessie, Nessie ...

Benjamin Robinson writes:  One of the world's most durable legends is that
   Loch Ness, Scotland, is inhabited by a giant creature resembling a water-
   going brontosaurus.  Speculation was fueled by a famous photo allegedly
   taken by two men, showing Nessie's head rising from the surface of the Loch
   on a fog-bound morning.  Everybody had an opinion as to what it was.  Many
   scientists figured it was a fraud.  Others felt it was a natural
   phenomenon, like a log that happened to be floating on the surface.  Still
   others thought there may be a yet-undiscovered creature, hiding in the
   waters of the Loch.  (It isn't =quite= as far- fetched as you think.  A
   ceolenocath [sic], a type of prehistoric fish, was caught off the coast of
   Madagascar long after it was supposed to be extinct.)  In the end, the
   doubters were right, at least about the photo:  One of the men confessed on
   his deathbed that the picture was a hoax.  Human nature being what it is, I
   doubt that this will be the last we hear from Nessie.


Tom Rinschler adds:  Except of course, Loch Ness was covered by a mile-deep
   glacier during the ice ages (in other words, most of the last few million
   years or so).  And the river connecting Loch Ness to the sea is too shallow
   for a Nessie-sized monster to swim up.


>> Car Watch Megastore

Benjamin Robinson:  The purple car in front of the button store looks like a
   Mazda Miata.

   The car in front of the bookmobile lady's former house is definitely a Fiat
   X1/9.

   Burns' car sports a "RR" on the grille, marking it as positively a Rolls-
   Royce, as opposed to the Rolls-Royce knockoff that I had assumed it was.
   Note that Burns replaced the flying lady hood mascot with an atom figure.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Monty Parts


Jordan Eisenberg's Alterna-alterna-title:  "The Trouble With Millionaires"


Jake Lennington suggests:  "Bad Will Hunting"


Haynes Lee:  Knocking out Mohammed Ali is quite tasteless since he does now
   have Parkinson's disease.

       gesture]

Burns: Now, Mr. Rude, I just want you to know I'm a good sport, so if you want
       to make fun of my legendary love of cashews, you have at it!
Rude:  Uh-huh...  Alright, how many times a day do you go to the can?
Burns: Oh, about 40, I suppose.  When are we going on the air?
Rude:  We're on the air now, Skeletor.
Burns: What?!
Rude:  Question two:  How long is your wiener, seriously?
Burns: Great heavens!  What kind of radiola show is this?
Rude:  How about this -- when was your first gay experience?
Burns: Oh, well, when I was six, my father took me on a picnic.  That was a
       gay old time!  Oh-ho, I ate my share of wieners that day.
Rude:  Oh, that sounds lovely.  [coughs "queer"] Um, ever murder anybody?
Burns: Murder?  Well, mistakes have been made.
Rude:  Monty, I've heard you're a pretty flatulent guy.  Any comment on that?
Burns: Oh, now see here--
       [Rude presses a button making fart noises]
       Stop that!  Attention wireless listeners, most of the sounds you are
       now hearing are not being made by me!  Oh stop!  Stop!  Won't someone
       please stop the farting!  [collapses on the floor]
Rude:  Don't worry, folks, he's not dead.  I still hear some faint sounds of
       life. [makes fart noises]
-- Mr. Burns's radio interview, "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% Homer drives Mr. Burns.

Burns: That didn't go well, did it?
Homer: Good thing those lesbians knew CPR.
Burns: Oh, what's the use?  I'll never be a popular beloved billionaire like
       Arthur Fortune.
Homer: [wistfully] Oh, Arthur Fortune.  [sighs] Do you know what that fabulous
       man just did?  He gave the Springfield Zoo two male pandas *and* got
       them to mate successfully!
Burns: And a stunt like that impresses people?
Homer: Oh, yeah.  And I'm not easily impressed.  Wow!  A blue car!
Burns: If a couple of Chinese bamboo gobblers can win people's hearts, I'm
       going to bring them something that man has searched for since the dawn
       of time.
Homer: A sober Irishman?       
Burns: Even rarer.

% Mr. Burns and Homer take a helicopter to Loch Ness.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 5:54  Running Time: 13:53]
%
% Groundskeeper Willie works on setting up camp while Professor Frink sets up
% equipment.

Homer:  Do you really think you can capture the Loch Ness monster?  I mean,
        he's eluded Leonard Nimoy *and* Peter Graves.
Burns:  Peter Graves couldn't find ugly at a Radcliffe mixer.
Frink:  [taking equipment out of a crate] Let's see now, we have the
        monsterometer, flipper finder, hoaxiscope, which is important for the
        looking and finding.
Willie: Ach, the whole town's turned out.  I've never seen them so excited.
        [a woman, two men, and an additional couple stand there watching and
        not looking very excited]
Homer:  Hey, Willie, that old couple looks just like you.
Willie: Aye, 'tis my ma and pa.  They own a tavern hereabouts.  They still
        have the same pool table on which I was conceived, born, and educated.
        [walks to his parents]
Ma:     So, you're back, son.
Willie: Aye.
Pa:     I suppose you'll be leaving soon.
Willie: Aye.
        [all shrug and part]
-- "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% Homer tries to get in an old-fashioned diving suit, but has trouble getting
% a buckle around his waist.  Willie just stands there and Frink uses the
% flipper finder.

Burns:  Where's my monster, tubby?  What do you people think I'm paying you
        for?
Homer:  Um, to work in your power plant?
Willie: You're not paying *me* anything.
Frink:  You *kidnapped* me.  I remember it distinctly with the grabbing, duct
        taping, tennis ball in the mouth.  It hurt me.
Burns:  The beast looks something like this [takes out a plush Loch Ness
        monster with a hat and shirt], only without the saucy T-shirt.
-- "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% Homer wears an old-fashioned diving suit.  Giving his group the thumbs-up,
% he wades into the Loch.  Hours later, Willie, Burns, and Frink still wait
% for Homer to return.  His air tube goes into the lake, across the bottom,
% out the other side, and into the Loch Ness Pub.  There, Homer plays pinball
% with the suit still on.
%
% That evening, everyone takes a break, except for Professor Frink, who is
% using one of his devices.

Frink:  Oh, my great good God.  Gentlemen, your attention, please.  I am
        detecting a gigantic amphibious life form!  It's 80 meters long and
        it's heading this way!  Oh, good glavin, it's on my shoe!  It's a ...
        a small frog.  Just get off. Just get off.  Get out!  Get out!
        [shakes the frog off his shoe] Stupid machine.  Oh, wait a minute,
        this isn't the monsterometer, it's the frog exaggerator!
Burns:  We're the laughingstock of the town!
        [the five people stand there looking mildly annoyed]
Homer:  Don't worry, Mr. Burns.  We're gonna find that monster no matter how
        long it takes.  [wearing a kilt, giddy]  Besides, I'm getting kind of
        used to wearing a kilt.  [giggles] Can you believe I'm a size four?
        [spins, causing the kilt to rise and show he's not wearing underwear]
        Whoo!
Pa:     Ach.
Man 1:  Aye.
Burns:  Oh, it's pointless hunting for an animal that has 24 miles of water to
        hide in.  Drain the lake.
Willie: What?!
Burns:  You heard me.  Deploy the delochinator.
-- "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% Professor Frink uses a hand pump to remove the water.  As the lake is almost
% empty, the nearby town is flooded.
%
% Looking through binoculars, Mr. Burns thinks he sees the monster, but it's
% just Loch Ness's old homecoming float.  Homer disagrees with the message
% "Stomp Aberdeen" written on the float.
%
% Just then, the real Loch Ness monster crushes the float with one flipper and
% lets out a mighty roar.  Homer identifies the creature by comparing it to
% the plush toy.  Willie, Frink, and Homer don't want to try to overpower it,
% so Mr. Burns decides to do it himself.  He takes of his jacket and tie, and
% rolls up his sleeves.
%
% Soon, the monster is tied up, dangling from the helicopter.  Inside the
% helicopter:

Willie: That was amazing, Mr. Burns!
Burns:  I was a little worried when he swallowed me, but, well, you know the
        rest.  And now, for my triumphant return to Springfield.
-- "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% Out on a pier, a stage is set up as many Springfieldians wait for the show
% to start.  Kent Brockman reports on the event.

Brockman: Monster fever has gripped Springfield by the throat, and it's all
          thanks to one man.  Montgomery Burns has captured not only a
          legendary monster, but also our hearts.  And by the way, girls, he's
          single!
Selma:    Single?  Well, he passes the Selma test.  [sprays breath freshener]
-- "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% Mr. Burns walks onstage.

Thank you everyone.  And now, presenting the ninth wonder of the world  -- the
eighth being Gomer Pyle's heavenly singing voice -- I give you the Loch Ness
monster!
-- Mr. Burns, "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% The curtains open, revealing Nessie wading in an aquarium.  The crowd cheers
% and chants "Monty".  For that moment, Mr. Burns is happy.
%
% The monster raises its head and everyone starts taking pictures with the
% flashes on.  Mr. Burns warns everyone that they'll enrage the beast, but
% Nessie just coos and smiles.  After a lot more flash photography, Mr. Burns
% is blinded and stumbles into a crane camera, which knocks over speakers and
% lights, starting fires.  The crowd runs away and Nessie just stays in the
% aquarium.

Wait, don't go!  Love meeee!!
-- Mr. Burns, "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% Later, Homer and Mr. Burns sit at the end of the dock.

Homer: Well, if you wanted people to love you, you sure blew it with that
       insane rampage.
       [Mr. Burns sighs]
       But, you know what?  To be loved, you have to be nice to people, every
       day, but to be hated, you don't have to do squat!
Burns: You know, perhaps you're right!  I got so swept over the notion of
       being liked, I completely forgot who I am -- I'm a selfish old crank,
       and that fits me like a Speedo.
       [Nessie rubs his head against Burns and Homer and coos]
Homer: So, what do we do with our friend, here?  Throw him in the dumpster?
Burns: Oh, no, no, no.  I really want to give the lovable scamp a good home.
-- "Monty Can't Buy Me Love"

% At Vegas Town Casino, Nessie supervises as Homer pulls a slot machine lever
% and loses.

Burns:  Tough luck, Simpson.
Homer:  Come on, Nessie!  One more pull!
        [Nessie bellows]
        Okay, okay.  Want a shrimp cocktail?
Nessie: [shakes his head, "Nah"]
Homer:  Yeah, they're not great.
