===============================================================================
The words to the hymn are written as "In-a-gadda-da-vida", but the
congregation sings "In the Garden of Eden".  (see below) {ddg}

How did everyone know where to come in?  How did everyone know how to
read music well enough to sing along properly?  {np}

The congregation sure become sweaty quickly.  {rl}

Jasper's beard isn't colored in.  {br}

The shot of everyone holding candles is sloppily-drawn, particularly
Mrs. Krabappel.

Ralph is standing with two people who don't look like his parents in
church.  {dy}

When Lovejoy has the kids in his office, it's 8am: that's one early
church service they must have had.  {br}

When Milhouse snitches on Bart, Martin's hair is gray.  {rl}

Some of the organ pipe cleaners disappear after Moe hands them to the
boys.  {dh}

Lovejoy slams the door to his office, but when he's counting the
collection money, the door is open.  {jcw}

Lovejoy's tie changes colors.  {dh}

Bart does so believe in souls: {rl}

    - MG22: Bart states that his pagan soul yearns to roam free
    - 7F13: Bart doesn't fear hell
    - 7F13: Bart defers to Lisa's soul-saving quest
    - 1F11: Bart yearns to cast away "the shackles of the soul-crushing
      hellhole that is Springfield Elementary"
    - 1F17: Bart welcomes Lisa to "the nether regions of the soul"

The characters looked different, most particularly Moe (whose tooth
isn't usually missing).  {ddg}

Moe _did_ used to serve food (e.g., 7G01 and 7G08).  {dh}

Why would Homer bring Maggie to Moe's, except for the gag?  {ddg}

Marge inquires about the steakfish at Moe's, yet she's allergic to
seafood in 9F06.  {pl}

Lisa is smart enough not to fall for the "present in the driveway"
thing.  {ddg}

The sewer grate in front of the driveway is aligned so that bikes, etc.,
can get their wheels stuck in them.  {ddg}

The sewer grate has never been there before.  {dh}

The driveway looks dry after the spraying.  {dh}

Bart's hose disappears in some scenes.  {dh}

Bart and Lisa's position on the driveway changes.  {dh}

A penny thrown from the Seattle Space Needle would _not_ bury itself in
the concrete.  See the alt.urban.legends FAQ.  {hl}

More space needles land around Scratchy than are dropped by Itchy.
{dh2}

Itchy's shoes vanish.  {dh}

The Navy would absolutely, positively never deliver anything someone
purchased from it as surplus.  {th}

Uncle Moe's restaurant isn't actually a family restaurant since alcohol
is served on the premises.  {th}

The fence to Milhouse's yard grows a gate.  {dh}

Milhouse's location changes in his back yard.  {dh}

Some plastic soldiers don't move even though Millhouse runs over them
with a tank.  {jp}

When Marge tucks Bart in, his room switches designs, from a light switch
and a mirror, to no light switch and a bulletin board.  {rl}

When Marge tucks Bart in, the door to Bart's room becomes a closet.
{rl}

In the first shot, you can't see anything through Bart's window, but in
another shot you can see a tree.  {rl}

The boats don't create waves in some scenes.  {jp}

Bart's dream-ending scream is nonstandard: his tongue is missing.  {rd}

Bart has his hands clinching his bed sheets, but some scenes show his
arms under the covers.  {dh}

The stripes of the tent on either side of the Milhouse's door change
from blue on both sides to pink on both sides to pink on the left and
blue on the right.  {dh2}

The menus disappear from Moe's hand.  {dh}

Rod is celebrating his tenth birthday, according to Ned, but isn't Todd
the same age as Bart, which would make him ten too?  {ddg}

How did Moe know Rod would order those fries?  {dh}

When Bart runs out of Uncle Moe's, Homer's sidehairs are not in their
typical "M" shape.  {rl}

Bart's Spaghetti and Moe Balls disappears in one shot.  {rl}

After Ralph shoots Moe with the water gun, a woman behind Moe turns her
head away from the camera, but in the next shot, she still looks at the
camera.  {rl}

Ralph's water gun disappears.  {dh}

Why isn't Sherri & Terri's father at the party?  {ddg}

Moe's sparklers disappear after his dance for Sherri.  {rl}

Bart's bike differs from that in 2F11.  {dh2}

The street cleaner disappears in a subway station; why would a city with
a subway station also want a monorail in 9F10?  {ddg}

Ralph already knows Bart.  See episodes 8F13, 8F24, 9F13, 1F05, 1F22,
2F04, 2F05, and 2F07.  {dh}

In the establishing shot of the comic book store, the open/closed-plaque
is on the inside of the door.  When the comic book guy turns it over, it
is on the outside.  {jp}

When Bart bangs his head, the X on the Red Sox pennant flag behind him
disappears.  {ddg}

It's raining when Bart walks home, yet he's not wet when he arrives.
{rl}

When Martin says "It's like punting down the Thames!", his lips don't
move.  Plus, the captioning doesn't include the line, which makes me
believe it was added afterward.

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Mark Richey: I was pleasantly surprised how good this episode was.  It
    was sweet and touching and quite funny.  The characterization of
    Bart and Lisa was excellent.  If the show can remain as good as it
    has been the past two weeks, I think many of the complaints about
    the quality will die down.  Grade: A.

Dave Kathman: I thought this episode was fantastic --- the best since
    "Lisa's Wedding", in my opinion.  It was funny, and touching, and
    just plain unique; it would have been right at home in the third or
    fourth season.  Biggest laugh for me: "Ow!  My freakin' ears!"

Marilyn Castro: This was one of the stupidest episodes I've seen.  It
    was corny and predictable and it had the humor of Erkle's show.  I
    don't know what the hell is wrong with the writers of the show, but
    I think the good ones have been replaced with nephews and beer
    buddies of the show's producers.

Coleman Baker: Tonight's episode, while not the best, was a solid, funny
    one.  What impressed me most about this one is that the writers
    finally created another show with two running storylines -- like the
    great "Lisa's Substitute".  I think this helps the timing of the
    show and the storylines seem to have fewer lulls in them.

Christine Tiplady: A quite unintriguing premise.  Sorry, I don't believe
    in a soul either.  No good laughs.  Much too predictable.  "I sold
    it to someone last night, someone very interested in a little boy's
    soul.  Can't tell you who."  Hmm, I wonder!

Don Del Grande: Grade: B-Plus - a little bit funnier than the first two
    episodes, even if the animation was a little off and each of the
    three scenes ended rather flatly (especially that first scene; the
    music corresponded to Bart's expression and just didn't mix with the
    Homer/SLH joke behind them).

Aaron Varhola: Freakin' great!  A very good balance between humor and
    heartfelt emotion; the parodies of chain restaurants were accurate
    and hilarious, and we got to see that Bart's soul is his mischievous
    spirit.  Lisa was characterized _very_ well; caring, sweet, and
    intelligent, but a bit devious.  A/A+.

Doug Yovanovich: I quite liked this episode.  We got to see more of the
    supporting characters like Moe, the comic book store guy, Milhouse.
    There wasn't much plot to speak of, but the characterizations were
    excellent and the humor was classic.  On the whole, this episode was
    well-written.  Grade: B.

Greg Lam: A-.  Surprisingly good, especially the ending and dream
    sequences.  While predictable, the ending was much better than in
    the similar "Round Springfield", emotional without being maudlin.
    Good enough so I didn't regret missing an amazing ending to the
    Baseball playoff game.

Nate Patrin: This episode kicked hairy yellow butt, right from the In-A-
    Gadda-Da-Vida bit to the Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag bit (I've been
    to restaurants like that and they frighten me) all the way to the
    predictable-but-nice-anyway ending.  I give it 9.0 out of 10.

Dominik Halas: For an episode with such an inherently strange theme, it
    was well done.  I enjoyed seeing some actual character development
    for Bart, and, like last week, there weren't any pointless
    references or lame jokes that had nothing to do with the plot.
    However, it didn't seem like an exceptional episode.  Grade: B+.

Brandon Kremer: With the fantastic characterization and a good storyline
    that didn't seem _too_ outrageous (a la Bart vs Australia), not to
    mention some great writing, I'd have to give this one a 9.5/10.

Bob Yantosca: Grade: A-.  Another great religion episode!  I guess Bart
    didn't learn anything from the time when Homer sold his soul to
    Flanders...At times the episode felt kinda flat but the gags were
    great.

Benjamin Robinson: Good premise, funny joke-writing, a peek at Lisa's
    devious side, and a warm ending make this a fine episode.  Even the
    "Itchy & Scratchy" short was better than usual.  I also liked the
    semi-creepy "Twilight Zone" feel that permeated the first act.  I'll
    give it an A.

Ricardo Lafaurie: An all-time great for me, ranks above "Duffless".
    Yeah, there were some scenes that wound out (the "hymn" and Homer
    trying to get Moe's attention) but some of the stuff was _classic_.
    I also liked the way Sherri and Terri said "We're twins," and the
    Uncle Moe commercial was priceless.  My grade: A.

Jose Lafaurie: A laugh-a-thon from start to finish, especially the "In-A
    Gadda-Da-Vita" and Moe's commercial.  Classic!  Did you notice how
    the announcer sounded all down home and stupid in the commercial?
    Milhouse's Ayatollah line had me ROTFL, and the "raving derelict"
    was freaked.  (A+)

Tony Hill: This was fairly decent, considering the sentimental ending.
    Bart's struggle was actually rather heroic.  The best line was
    Bart's pleading, "you traded my soul for POGS?!"  I thought about
    that line while driving immediately after the ep and laughed so
    much, I nearly had to pull over.  Grade A.

Yours truly: Another fair episode with good characterization and a
    number of decent jokes.  I enjoyed the whole restaurant parody (I've
    had lots of stupid "Happy Birthday"s sung to me and friends over the
    years), but the episode didn't really grab me.  Grade: B.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida

A few notes on this song:

    - The song was written and recorded by Iron Butterfly in 1968.
    - It really is 17 minutes long, and includes long bass guitar and
      drum solos.
    - Ricardo Lafaurie says that "according to my reports, in one
      concert, in the middle of the song the guitarists left to get a
      bite to eat and left the drummer alone, then when they returned,
      the song was still playing.  Then the drummer left, i.e. ad
      nauseum.  As you can see, an incredibly long song."
    - Aaron Varhola writes, "It's known as a `bathroom song' because of
      its length.  DJs play it whenever they need to go, so there isn't
      any dead air while nature calls."
    - The official story is that the song was originally called "In the
      Garden of Eden", but when it was recorded, the lead singer was so
      whacked out (alcohol? drugs?) that it came out garbled.
    - Randy Wawrzyniak-Fry supplies the lyrics as:
   
          In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
          Don't you know that I'm lovin' you
          In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby
          Don't you know that I'll always be true
   
          Oh, won't you come with me
          And take my hand
          Oh, won't you come with me
          And walk this land
          Please take my hand
          In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
          [etc.]
   
    - Jon Johnson says, "Despite the fact that the album seems like a
      big joke these days, I've heard that it was the biggest seller in
      Atlantic Records' history up until the time Led Zeppelin came
      along.  And, even counting Led Zep, it's still one of the biggest-
      selling albums Atlantic ever stuck their name on.  It's actually a
      pretty fun album if you're in the proper frame of mind."
    - Lovejoy reading the name as "I.  Ron Butterfly" is probably a
      reference to L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of
      Scientology, of which Nancy Cartwright is a fairly high-profile
      member.
    - The sheet music Bart hands out is written in E minor (one sharp),
      but the organist plays it in D minor (one flat).  This isn't
      really an error, though: sheet music for hymns doesn't have to
      correspond perfectly to the instrumental music.

>> Bennigans and Fuddruckers

Tony Hill notes, "Bennigans and Fuddruckers are restaurant chains.
    However, only Fuddrucker's is a family restaurant.  Bennigans, which
    serves alcohol, was owned by Pillsbury.  Pillsbury was forced to
    sell Bennigans after being acquired by Grand Metropolitan, since
    companies which manufacture alcohol are not allowed to sell it to
    consumers."

>> The Simpsons at Moe's

Aaron Varhola lists the previous episodes where Homer's family have come
    to Moe's.

    - 7F10: Marge comes in to to get Homer back after he thought she
      cost him the $500,000 settlement from Mr. Burns hitting Bart with
      his car.
    - 8F04: Lisa goes there to interview Homer for the school paper.
      (Moe serves her a beer and gives Homer her chocolate milk.)
    - 8F09: Bart goes there to pick up Homer and ends up performing for
      Moe and harassing Mr. Burns.
    - 9F19: Bart and Lisa attend the party after the Krusty Komeback
      Special at Moe's.
    - 2F15: Adult Bart goes to Moe's with Homer and Hugh Parkfield.

>> Alf

Ricardo Lafaurie reminds us, "`Alf' was a real loser show back in the
    '80s featuring an alien guy who had a thing for eating cats that
    crash-landed on Earth and lives with an earth family.  It spawned a
    cartoon show, games, and other such merchandise, but, as the way of
    all '80s fads, died out.  (Hopefully, OFF will never die.)"

>> Seven Deadly Sins?

Dan Hoey noticed the following occurrences of the seven deadly sins in
    this episode:

    - Gluttony: Homer's brain saying, "Silence, fool!  It can be ours!"
    - Greed: Moe's comment about family restaurants being where the
      money is
    - Sloth: Bart and Milhouse not working too hard at cleaning the
      organ
    - Lust: Homer to Marge: "Remember when we used to make out to this
      hymn?"
    - Pride: Bart being too proud to believe he has a soul
    - Envy: Lisa wishing she had five bucks
    - Wrath: Moe losing it at the little girl's sodie

Milhouse: Oh, it can swim.  It's even got wheels in case you die in the
          desert and it has to drive to the cemetery.

Bart: [sighs] I wasted five bucks on these.

Bart: Aw, I sold my soul to Milhouse?
Lisa: [incredulous] What?  How could you _do_ that?  Your soul is the

Bart: You believe in that junk?
Lisa: Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart, it's the

Bart: [tsking sadly] Poor, gullible Lisa.  I'll keep my crappy sponges,

         [leans down; Rod tries a couple of fries]
   Moe: Please take the fries off my head, kid.  The basket is extremely
        hot.

% Moe personally waits on Homer's table.

 Lisa: How are the southwestern pizza fingers?
  Moe: They're, um...[reads] "awesomely outrageous".
Marge: Oh, these look good: guilt-free steakfish filets.
  Moe: Nah, nah, let me level with you, Marge: that's just our name for
       bottom-feeding suction eel.  You don't want that.
Marge: Oh...
  Moe: Why don't you try...Moe's hobo chicken chili.  I start with the
       best part -- the neck -- and then I add secret hobo spices.
Marge: Ooh.  Tres bien.
  Moe: Yeah.
        [Ralph squirts Moe with a squirt gun and laughs]
       Hey, what the hell are you doing, you little freak?
        [Ralph starts bawling]
  Moe: [apologetic] Ooh, sorry, kid, sorry.  I'm not used to the
       laughter of children.  It cuts through me like a dentist drill.
       But no, no, that was funny, that was funny taking away my dignity
       like that, ha ha ha.
-- Moe, always appreciative of a good joke, "Bart Sells His Soul"

         Lisa: I would like to say grace.  Ahem.
               Lord, have mercy on my soul...and Mom's soul...and Dad's
               soul...and Maggie's soul...and let every _soul_ in

        Marge: Bart!
         Bart: I can't _take_ this any more.  I want my soul, and I want
               it now!  [runs out]
        Homer: Bart, you didn't finish your spaghetti and Moe balls!
Homer's brain: Silence, you fool.  It can be ours!
        Homer: [eating] Run, boy!  Run!  Run for your life, boy!

% Bart pounds his fist on Milhouse's door.

 Bart: Milhouse...Milhouse!  You win.  I want this nightmare to end!
        [a space-suited figure answers the door]
Robot: Leave this place.  You are in great danger.
 Bart: [fearful] Where's Milhouse?
Robot: The one you call Milhouse is gone.
        [takes helmet off]
  Man: He went to his grandma's place while we're spraying for potato
       bugs.
        [camera pulls back to show house covered by a tent]
 Bart: Oh.  When Milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a
       piece of paper?
  Man: Oh, yeah.  You don't forget a thing like that.

% At Moe's, the million-dollar birthday fries siren goes off again.  Moe
% sighs heavily, uses the Lord's name in vain, and goes into his spiel.

     Moe: [sighs] Here you go!  Here I am!
          Uncle Moe -- thank you, ma'am!
          This'll be a treat:
          Uncle Moe!  Here I am, while you eat!
  Sherri: Yay!  Now do it for Terri.
     Moe: What, it's your birthday too?
Together: We're twins.
     Moe: [sighs] Here you go, here I am.  Eat your fries, eat them.
           [puts them on the table and leaves]
     Kid: Here's you.  [gives Moe a drawing] [PH]
     Moe: [looking at it] Aw, jeez.  And you got the stink lines, and
          everything.
           [gives Snake his bill]
   Snake: Ho, dude: you did _not_ smile.  We eat for free.  Come on,
          Shoshanna, let's roll.
     Moe: But I sang you the potato stuffings.  Come on!  I sang you the
          potato stuffings.
  Krusty: Look at the vein on that guy's forehead.  He's gonna blow!
-- Just like Krakatoa, "Bart Sells His Soul"

% Moe's left eyelid flickers involuntarily, dangerously.

Child: Unky Moe?
  Moe: [trying hard for control] Whaaat...is it, sweetheart?
Child: My sodie is too cold.  My teef hurt!
  Moe: [mock sympathy] Oh, your "teef" hurt, huh?  Your "teef" hurt?
       Well that's too freaking bad!  You hear me?  I'll tell you where
       you can put your freaking sodie too!

        [Maude covers Todd's ears]
 Todd: Ow, my freaking ears!
Maude: [gasps] Oh, let's go, dear.
  Ned: Well, I expect that type of language at Denny's, but not here!
        [everyone leaves en masse]
  Moe: Aw, come on, folks.  Wait, please come back!  Please, I got a new
       offer: whenever Uncle Moe threatens you, you get a free steak...
       fish.

% Moe sighs heavily as his last customer walks out the door and slams
% it.

% Bart stops on his bike to look at a map.  "OK, OK.  Milhouse's
% grandmother lives on 257th St., and I'm on 3rd."  He jumps out the way
% just in time as a large street cleaner rolls over his bike.
% Miraculously, the bike gets spit out shining like new.  "Well,
% finally!  A little luck," grins Bart, hopping on and starting to
% pedal.  Two strokes later, the thing collapses around him.  The street
% cleaner driver laughs at Bart, all the way down the stairs of the 3rd
% St. subway station, right to the crash at the bottom.  Bart starts the
% long jog.
%
% At 181st and King, a derelict wanders around talking incomprehensibly
% fast.  Chief Wiggum pulls up in a squad car with Ralph riding shotgun.

Wiggum: Son, you wait here while Daddy tries to talk some sense into
        this raving derelict.
         [the man raves as Wiggum walks up]
Wiggum: [motioning] Slow down, slow down.
         [the man raves some more, something about "Albert Hitchcock
        stole every idea I ever had"]
        {_Who's_ been stealing your thoughts?}

         [Bart opens the squad car door]
  Bart: Hello, Ralph.
 Ralph: Aah!  Um, hi, Bart.  I know you from school.
  Bart: Yes.  A simple proposition, Ralph: how would you like to make a
        dollar?
 Ralph: Uh...I don't know.
  Bart: All you have to do is sign a paper that says I can have your
        soul.  [desperate] I need a soul, Ralph -- any soul.  Yours!
         [Ralph starts bawling]
Wiggum: [shining a flashlight] Hey, what's going on over there?
         [Bart hisses; he runs off into the mist and vanishes]

% The regular crowd sits in Moe's once again.  The restaurant is in the
% final stages of being taken apart by some other guys.

   Moe: Go on, take it all.  Get it all out of here.
Barney: You know, Moe, you might want to keep the fire extinguishers.
   Moe: Nah.  Too many bad memories.
Barney: {Well, look at the bright side, Moe: you still got us.}
   Moe: {Yeah.  Yeah, you know, that -- that actually makes me feel a
        little better.}
 Homer: {Why?  That was the problem in the first place: you were going
        broke because we were your only customers.  Wasn't that the
        problem in the first place?  That you were going broke?  Moe?
        Moe?  Hey, Moe.  Oh!  You're thinking about all the money you
        blew, aren't you.  [Moe nods] What was it?  Fifty, sixty
        thousand dollars?
        Moe, look: maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes
        you made from the beginning.  Moe?}
   Moe: {[exasperated] What?!}
 Homer: {Let me get a pen.}

% At Milhouse's grandmother's place, the parents sleep on a double sofa
% bed and Milhouse on a fold-out cot.  Bart knocks on the door.

 Grandma: A caller at this hour?  [to Mr. VH] You dial 9-1, then when I
          say so, dial 1 again.  [opens the door] [TM]
    Bart: [sees Milhouse, sighs with relief] Milhouse, please.
Milhouse: Bart, I can't play now.  It's 2:00 a.m.
    Bart: Milhouse, I've _got_ to have my soul back.  I'll do anything
          you want.
Milhouse: Uh...well...
  Mr. VH: Uh, Milhouse, give him back his soul!  I've got work tomorrow.
Milhouse: I'm really sorry...I kind of traded your soul to the guy at
          the comic book store.  But look!  I got some cool pogs: [shows
          them] Alf pogs!  Remember Alf?  He's back...in pog form.
    Bart: [incredulous] You traded my soul for pogs?!
           [runs out screaming]
 Grandma: Close that door!  You're letting the heat out.
  Mr. VH: Shut up, shut up, shut up!

% Bart decides to sleep in from of the comic book guy's store that
% night.  In the morning, the owner arrives.

Owner: If you are waiting for the Hi & Lois signing, it has been moved
       to the Springfield Coliseum.
 Bart: Please, you have something of mine on a little piece of paper.
Owner: Oh, so you're Bart Simpson, eh?  Well, since my breakfast burrito
       is congealing rapidly, I will be blunt: you're too late.  I sold
       your soul last night.
        [Bart looks worried]
       Yes, yes: I found a buyer right away for _that_ item.
 Bart: Who?
Owner: I am not at liberty to divulge the party, but they were most
       interested in having possession of Little Boy's soul.
        [Bart bangs his head]
       Um, excuse me: no banging your head on the display case, please.
       It contains a very rare Mary Worth in which she has advised a
       friend to commit suicide.  Thank you.  [eats burrito]
-- Too bad that friend wasn't Rex Morgan M.D., "Bart Sells His Soul"

% Bart walks home in the rain, dejected.  He enters his room and gets on
% his knees.

Bart: [plaintive] Are you there, God?  It's me, Bart Simpson.  I know I
      never paid too much attention in church, but I could really use
      some of that good stuff now.  I'm...afraid.  I'm afraid some
      weirdo's got my soul and I don't know what they're doing to it!  I
      just want it back.  Please?  [starts to cry] I hope you can hear
      this.
       [his soul floats down from above]
       [he grabs it and hugs it, and sees Lisa standing there]
      Lisa?  _You_ bought this?
Lisa: With the change in my piggy bank.
Bart: There's no change in your piggy bank.
Lisa: Not in any of the ones _you_ know about.
Bart: Oh, Lis, thank you.  [kisses her]
Lisa: Happy to do it.  But you know, Bart, some philosophers believe
      that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one [Bart
      eats the piece of paper] through suffering and thought and prayer,
      like you did last night.
Bart: Uh huh.  [swallows]
-- Word to the wise, "Bart Sells His Soul"

% Bart sleeps with a little smile on his face that night, the family
% pets curled up on his bed with him.  In his dream, he and his soul row
% toward the green castle on the island.  He hears Martin nearby, "Hah!
% It's like punting on the Thames.  Stroke!  Stroke!"  He and his soul
% glance slyly at one another, then steer their boat into Martin's.
% Martin's soul gets knocked over the side.  Bart and his soul laugh and
% continue on their way, chuckling.
