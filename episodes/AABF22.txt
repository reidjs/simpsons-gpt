   [If you use these summaries to determine if you found the right capsule,
   here's a TV Guide-like synopsis:  Young Bart is diagnosed with Attention
   Deficit Disorder (ADD) and given an experimental medicine.  The drug works
   wonders -- until the side effects kick in.  Mark McGwire guest-stars.  --

==============================================================================
Blackboard:     PORK IS NOT A VERB

Couch:          Everybody is white with "paint by numbers" numbers; artists
                come in and add the colors  {ddg}

Don Del Grande:

   ... Nelson doesn't have his collar when talking to Bart when he was driving
       the tank?

Richard Green:

       only member who remains from 9F01, and Ned, Maude, Moe, and Kirk have
       joined (Luanne used to be a member)  [But see Jeremy Reaban's DYN --

       cell phone company in "Make Room For Lisa"

   ... Skinner's punching bag looks like Bozo the Clown?

   ... Homer and Marge actually ENJOYED "Showgirls"?  (That makes two of us
       ...)

Joe Klemm:
   ... among the poetry studied in class is poetry by Jewel?

       episode?
   ... the members of the fire department seem to be the same ones from Homer

Dave Sibley:
   ... how tolerant of gay people Homer was?

Alexander Woods:
   ... that Bart's eyes were kind of evil looking the entire episode (like
       Hubert's eyes in the Halloween special 3 years ago)?

> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
==============================================================================
+  At the start of Act I, both Bart's and Maude's voices sounded a little off.
   [Marcia Mitzman-Gaven did some of Maude's lines, which may account for that
   difference.  Dunno about Bart, though.  See "Comments" section for more --
   Ed.]  {cg}

-  In the very first scene at the school in Brother's Little Helper, Mr. Burns
   and Smithers are standing right in front of the school doors.  the school
   is fairly far back so it's not very noticeable.  If you look very closely,
   Smithers' face is indeed black!  {cw}

+  Springfield has had a full-time fire department in many episodes.  {th}

+  Also, they used the abbreviation "SVFD" tonight, but in a fifth season
   episode (I can't remember which), the equipment was marked "SPFD."  {th}

+  Apu's hat no longer says "fire chief" on it.  (Did he get demoted?)  {rg}

=  In close up, Maude's peace sign belt buckle is missing one of its lower
   spokes, so it looks like she's wearing a Mercedes logo.  {bjr}

+  the gymnasium was never a separate building from the school before this
   episode  {rg}

*  How did Bart get the hose up to the gym window?  {th}

+  In the diorama, it shows that all the students around Bart receive bad
   grades. However, in a later scene Martin Prince is shown by Bart.  {wb}

=  In the play scene, Martin sports a girl's hairdo, which is gone in the
   later playground scene.  {bm}

=  [Homer's] lips didn't match the words when naming famous people on drugs.
   {jj}

c  Homer names off "Andy Dick," but the CC reads "Martin Lawrence."  {ac}

+  Nelson is not wearing his shock collar while he is in class even though he
   was wearing it in all the other scenes he appears in.  {ds}

=  When Lisa comes into Bart's room, he pushes away from the desk, [after] the
   cut to Lisa, he pushes away from the desk again and stands up.  {jj}

+  Is there another water park besides Mt. Splashmore?  If Homer had a 10-year
   ban, it would still be on (in theory, it would last until Bart turned 20).
   {ddg}

-  When Bart is running on the treadmill, we see a periodic table reflected in
   the window.  It should be backwards, like most reflections.  {cg}

*  The chemical name "chlorhexinol" should really be "chlorOhexAnol."  {sw}

*  What tank can be driven by the person whose head sticks out of the tank's
   hatch?  {ddg}

*  When Bart is driving the tank at Springfield Elementary, he drives over
   see-saws, with out damage.  The see-saws should have been crushed due to
   the tank's weight.  (yd)

*  The tank ran out of gas ... but they actually run on Diesel.  [It's
   possible Bart didn't know that, though -- Ed.]  {jj}

*  How could Bart have shot down a space satellite with a tank, let alone find
   the satellite with the naked eye?  {jg}

*  And how did it fall to Earth so fast?  {jg}

*  And it didn't disintegrate in the atmosphere.  {ddg}

*  Even though the missile went up at an angle to hit the satellite, and the
   satellite would have fallen straight down, it landed at the site of the
   tank.  [{ddg} says, "If anything, it would have fallen in the other
   direction, as it was struck in the direction in which it fell."]  {th}

*  Unless it was constantly being moved around under its own power, [the
   satellite] couldn't possibly have been maintaining a constant surveillance
   on Springfield as only satellites over the equator can maintain the same
   position over Earth.  {ddg}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Wilson Banswell:  Is this a return to seasons 1-7?  It sure seems so.  There
   was dumb Homer, Motherly Marge, and mischievous Bart.  The first two acts
   were A material, while third, while wacky, was still quite funny indeed.
   The opening scene was a classic, with Maude and Ned Flanders in the hippie
   skit.  Also, the scene with Mark McGwire, though it seemed rushed, was also
   quite funny.  The bat with the camera was, a great DYN (Snack Preference:
   ALL)  (A)

Don Del Grande:  Call me a fan of the old-fashioned action episodes, but I'm
   just a fan of these old-fashioned action episodes.  It could have used more
   of a subplot, though.  (Okay, time for everyone else to tell me why this
   was the worst episode in years ...)  (A-)

Yuri Dieujuste:  A horrible episode even by last year's standard.  The plot
   made very little sense, and the conspiracy theory was just some filler
   material to make the episode long enough for viewing.  Plus, the social
   commentary on the "over-drugged" society was too weak for the Simpsons.  I
   guess Fox is trying to make the show appeal to the non-intellectuals and
   "non-nerds".  (F)

Curtis Gibby:  Better than last week's episode.  It still had that cartoony
   feel, especially in Act I, which was the weakest.  (I guess that's
   something we'll have to get used to, even if we don't like it.)  The plot
   was a bit wacky, but seemed slightly better than some of Season 10's
   offerings.  There was a good mix of the family and secondary characters.
   (B-)

Joe Green:  This is the kind of OFF episode I vastly prefer to cookie-cutter
   "Homer Acts Like A Huge Jerk, Resulting In A Bunch of Hokey Slapstick"
   shows.  Most notably, it drove home a highly relevant message without
   resorting to in-your-face preachiness.  Here's hoping we get more like this
   as Season 11 progresses.  (A)

Richard Green:  I am saddened.  I figured that this episode could have some
   interesting storylines, with Bart becoming a good student, a la Separate
   Vocations, but instead, it seemed more like an X files episode with all the
   paranoia.  The appearance by Mark McGwire was wasted, and didn't even make
   any sense!  MLB is controlling the satellites?  C'mon ... the only
   satellites the MLB controls are the FOX satellites on Sunday nights, during
   World Series season.  The episode was mostly unfunny - I only laughed at
   loud in two places: "At my house we call them uh-ohs" with a rebound lol
   with the fire dog, and in the second act with Homer's Focusyn trap.  (C-)

Jack Haas:  Wow, George Meyer is back on the Simpsons, and it seems like he's
   still got the touch.  I liked this episode for a lot of reasons, first it
   was finally an episode with a decent plot that dealt with some sort of
   issue (in other words its just not "Homer drives a truck", or "Homer meets
   Mel Gibson),  I found the issue they dealt with interesting, and they
   managed to deal seriously with the subject while still making it funny, in
   a similar way to the way they dealt with the issue of handguns in "the
   cartridge family".  This episode's jokes were almost always funny, but at
   the same time they weren't just fart, and crap jokes.  It wasn't without
   its faults though, [...] but for the most part it was a good episode which
   will likely hold up to repeated watchings.  (B+)

Tony Hill:  Well, this started out as an OK ep, but it became quite
   unreasonable when Bart OD'ed on Focusyn and commandeered the tank.  I think
   it went bad at the moment the scientists kissed.  And how did the words
   "testicles" and "diarrhea" manage to stay in the script?  The last third
   was too much plastic reality for the ep to do better than a  (C+)

Carl Johnson:  A despicably shoddy episode with no direction at all.  There
   are few funny moments and the only real substance is in act two, and even
   there the writing is lousy.  The current writers are simply incapable of
   writing character-driven episodes, and I'd almost like to say that they
   should stop trying, for when they don't attempt to put emphasis on
   characters, the episode is usually funny.  Homer and Marge's
   characterization is the only strong point.  (D-)

Darrel Jones:  Ehh, this episode was about average.  It's nice to see the
   writers use a new, creative plotline, and some scenes were HILARIOUS (like
   Homer's "dance" and Bart running amuck), but the whole episode felt a
   little, I dunno, unsatisfying.  (B-)

Joe Klemm:  This episode is proof that even in its eleventh season, the show
   continues to have the spunk that made it a hit.  With a clever storyline
   and some very hysterical moments (Ralph calling fires "Uh oh's", the klown
   car bit), this episode should be the model of what later season eleven
   episodes should be.  (A+)

Michael Levy:  Second Episode of the season and with it, great improvement
   over last week.  It had everything that was lacking last week.  Good use of
   non-Simpson family characters, especially nice to see Ralph back in his
   gracious form.  Yet, they still seem to be not trying hard enough to
   develop why we get from here to there.  A little too much forced.
   Nonetheless, a solid B effort, hopefully an indicator of good things to
   come.  (B)

Ondre Lombard:  Beginning of story: Bart's destructive rambunctiousness
   results in his need for a prescription hyperactivity drug.  End of story:
   Bart steals a tank and uses it to destroy a privacy-invading satellite.
   Even the forced attempt to have fun with this plot on my end didn't really
   work.  There were various unnatural and strange progressions of the story
   that just didn't really work for me, and that includes the jokes, some of
   which had me scratching my head (like with Homer and Carl, and the shower
   bit).  Also, nothing about the story seemed to justify Bart's out of
   character, out of place and strange use of "testicles."  Well anyway, some
   jokes worked, and I liked the set-up, but this continued insanity succeeded
   in ruining any down-to-earth potential this episode may have had.  (C)

Patrick McGovern:  A return to form?  Seems like it.  Lots of intelligent
   commentary and good characterization for Bart overshadow the silliness of
   the 3rd act (Which was still funny).  And I'll take Stupid Homer (i.e.
   Original Homer) over Jerkass Homer any day.  Sadly, the Mark McGuire cameo
   is garbage, even if a good joke came of it.  (B+)

Nick Orechwa:  This was an episode which started off with a decent premise and
   then pretty much went exponentially downhill from there.  It seemed like
   the writers really did not know what to do with it and decided to insert as
   many lame and desperate gags as they could.  However, despite that, there
   were a few good moments.  In particular, the scenes Krusty had were good
   and the beginning with Flanders and his wife was humorous.  (C)

Matt Rose:  An admitted Simpsons cynic, I admit that I enjoyed this episode a
   lot, at times it really did feel like an episode from years past, with some
   good social commentary on a controversial issue and a few barbs at the
   Republican party. Bart seems like the only family member anymore where the
   jokes are still somewhat character driven, which makes a refreshing change
   of pace from "Look at Homer!  Look at what he's doing now!".  Plus anything
   giving Harry Shearer a vehicle for his Vin Scully impression always scores
   points with me.  Good Mr. Burns cameo.  Mark McGwire's appearance seemed
   wasted though, which is a shame. The show is abusing its celebrity drawing
   clout.  Overall, an episode not perfect by any means, but I'll take it.
   (B)

Jason Rosenbaum:  This one was quite odd.  It reminded me a lot from last
   week's episode: little plot, lotsa gags.  These are always hit or miss, and
   this episode sort of missed.  It was in your face, and had little wit, but
   did have some great gags ("Not the church, Jesus lives there!")  Overall,
   average fare.  (C+)

Evan Ross:  All in all, not a very good episode.  A lot of characters were out
   of character, so to speak; Marge in particular.  She never seemed that
   devious to trick her own sun before.  Besides that, there just weren't a
   whole lot of really funny jokes going around.  The first act at the fire
   safety show was good, yet Bart ended it by being cruel rather than
   mischievous.  The only laugh out loud line was delivered by Rod : "Daddy,
   is Mr. Simpson possessed? I guess so."  It was too strange also for Bart to
   get by with little punishment for actively destroying the town.  (C-)

Eric Sansoni:  Following David Stern, veteran writer George Meyer returns in
   the AABF series to pen his first show in years, far surpassing a typical
   effort by the newer writers.  Finally, an episode centered around hard-
   hitting, cutting-edge satire of a modern social trend.  Three-dimensional
   characterization, multi-leveled punchlines, and wonderfully balanced
   throwaway gags from the supporting characters make this entry as good as
   the average season four episode.  The dialogue of the drug-dispensing
   doctors was particularly amusing.  On the other hand, too many subpar,
   cartoony sight gags, and a conclusion so frantic it could have benefited
   from some "Focusyn" itself, keep this from being a classic.  (B)

Yours Truly:  If you were looking for evidence that Matt Groening is
   concentrating most of his attention on "Futurama," this show is it.
   Instead of the classic "Simpsons" combination of humor and relevance, we
   get to see Bart go on a third-act rampage that involves him driving a tank
   through Springfield.  There are some good moments, like Bart's
   Stepford-like behavior on Focusyn and his initial freak-out, but the
   general level of silliness overshadows them.  (C)

Joe Green:  Bart sings Fleetwood Mac's "Don't Stop" while driving the tank


Tony Hill:  "Straighten Up and Fly Right" was written by Nat King Cole and
   Irving Mills around 1945, based on a sermon Cole's preacher father had
   given.  It's about a monkey trying to ride a buzzard, whom the former tells
   to "Straighten Up and Fly Right."  Cole tried it out on Lucille Ball, who
   thought it was the filthiest song she ever heard.  Use your imagination as
   to what she thought the monkey was telling the buzzard to do.

>> Those never-ending threads

 - Where is Springfield?

Yuri Dieujuste:  Since most satellites are positioned over the equator,
   Springfield would have to be between 40 Degrees North Latitude and 55
   Degrees North Latitude since Bart aimed the tank cannon at those angles to
   hit MLB's satellite.


Darrel Jones:  This would probably place Springfield in the Northern US ...
   Hawaii is at about 20 Degrees North, the Mexican Border around 34 or 35
   Degrees North.  I think you'd have to be north of the Ohio River to hit 40
   Degrees.  The 55 Degrees North max could even place it in Alaska, but only
   the southern portion (like the Aleutian Islands, or the "mainland"
   peninsula in the southeast corner).


>> "They can hire new voices, and no one can tell the difference"

As you might have heard, voice actress Maggie Roswell left the show sometime
   during the break between the tenth and eleventh season.  Along with Tress
   MacNeille, Ms. Roswell was responsible for voicing many of the adult female
   characters in Springfield.  Her principal characters were LuAnne Van
   Houten, Elizabeth Hoover (Lisa's teacher), Helen Lovejoy, and Maude
   Flanders, but she also voiced many of the incidental characters.  Another
   actress, Marcia Mitzman-Gaven, was hired to fill in for the absent Ms.
   Roswell.  As it stands of this writing, Ms. Mitzman-Gaven's tenure on the
   show is destined to be short.  Rumor has it that Maude Flanders will be
   killed off sometime early this season, and that Roswell's remaining
   characters will be given the "silent treatment," a la Lunchlady Doris, Troy
   McClure, and Lionel Hutz.

   Both women's names appear in the credits tonight.  If you listen carefully,
   you may notice that Maude's voice changes from line to line as she performs
   the play.  It would appear that Ms. Roswell's departure took the staff by
   surprise, if Ms. Mitzman-Gaven had to show up in the middle of an episode.


Ondre Lombard adds:  Maude's changed voice was so remarkably obvious it was
   staggering.  I shudder to wonder what might've happened if Fox really did
   get scabs in place of the main staff.


>> Better Living Through Chemistry

Benjamin Robinson:  Fifty years ago, a student who disrupted class, couldn't
   sit still, and talked back to authority figures was branded a troublemaker
   and made to sit in the corner.  Today, we brand them an ADD victim, and
   make them take pills.  ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder, is the new term for
   what used to be known as "hyperactivity."  In the past, doctors blamed the
   disorder on diet (sugar was the prime suspect) or failure on the parents'
   part to discipline the child.  Now, such a child is likely to be diagnosed
   with ADD and given Ritalin. Interestingly, Ritalin is normally a stimulant
   but it has the opposite effect in ADD patients, making them calmer and more
   focused.  For people who really have ADD, the drug has been very
   beneficial.  The problem, according to some critics, is that some children
   who don't have ADD are diagnosed with it anyway.  The initial push for
   Ritalin comes not from the child's parents or pediatrician, but from the
   child's teacher.  In theory it makes sense, since the teacher spends more
   time observing a child's behavior than his or her parents often do, but
   some teachers can be Ritalin-happy.  They will recommend the child see the
   doctor (and get a prescription ... or else) simply because the teacher
   would rather deal with a room full of placid, docile children.  The debate
   over the proper course of treatment for ADD (or even how to diagnose ADD)
   continues to this day.  Parents of a candidate for Ritalin should proceed
   cautiously and discuss their concerns with a qualified doctor, just to be
   safe.

>> National Fire Prevention Week

Tom Restivo:  National Fire Prevention Week is usually observed the week of
   the Great Chicago Fire, which occurred on October 9, 1871. First proclaimed
   by President Coolidge in 1925, it is sponsored by the National Fire
   Protection Association (www.nfpa.org) to promote fire safety and to raise
   awareness in what to do in the event of fire. This year marked the second
   annual "Great Escape", which encouraged people to practice escape route out
   of their homes at 6 PM EST on October 6th.

   <Begin Groening "School is Hell" rant>

   Countless schoolchildren have endured the rigors of fire drills, with their
   sudden piercing alarms in all kinds of weather. Fire Prevention Week also
   introduced a dramatization of a fire emergency, often with tragic
   consequences. Rather than a play, as seen by Springfield Elementary, it was
   a graphic film meant to leave a memorable impression of the importance of
   fire safety, but more effectively caused many sleepless night about dying
   in bed. One particular nightmare grafted into my grammar school
   consciousness is a family of four wiped out, one by one, by smoke
   inhilation due to a smouldering cigarette.

   Informational, educational, and sure to provide enough psychosis for
   psychologists to study. Ritalin, anyone?

>> Fun With Slang

Benjamin Robinson explains two slang words worth knowing to get the full
   enjoyment from tonight's show:  Pork -- According to Robert Chapman's
   "American Slang," this word can mean, "to do the sex act; copulate."
   Notice that it is a verb.  Also notice that it's slightly improper, so
   choose your audience carefully if you want to use it.

   Frag -- Again according to Chapman, this is a Vietnam War-era term meaning,
   "to kill or wound someone, esp. a detested officer of one's own unit,
   typically by throwing a fragmentation grenade at him."


Curtis Gibby adds:  Also used by players in games such as Quake and Doom to
   describe kills, i.e. "He got tele-fragged."  "How many frags did you get?"


John M. Daniel:  "Frag" as a slang term dates back at least to the Vietnam
   War.  To frag someone meant to kill someone, usually a hated officer or
   leader who was too gung-ho, in a manner that made it look like enemy action
   -- such as rolling a fragmentation grenade (hence "frag") into the victim's
   tent, while co-conspirators fire their rifles and swear they saw VC fleeing
   the scene.

   Presumably the usage mutated into meaning "kill someone in a nasty way", as
   in Quake, but as a name for an Army base, it's more blackly humorous in
   terms of its original meaning.


>> "You mean like John Leguizamo?"

Joe Klemm explains who he is:  John Leguizamo is a very successful Hispanic
   actor.  Among his best work is his one-man show "Freak," which was
   nominated for a Tony and as well as an Emmy winner.  He has also appeared
   in several movies, with his film credits including "Super Mario Brothers,"
   "To Wong Fu, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar," and "Spawn."  [{bjr}
   adds, "he credits his involvement in the drama with helping him to stay
   straight"]


>> Chicken Soup for the Loser

Andrew Levine provides some background on Laundromat owner Bill Buckner:  Say
   the name "Bill Buckner" in Boston and you're likely to get arrested.
   Buckner was a first baseman for several major league baseball teams from
   1969-1990.  Although skilled as a line-drive hitter, Buckner's name was
   forever disgraced by his critical misplay in the 1986 World Series, when
   his Boston Red Sox played the New York Mets.  The Red Sox were ahead 3
   games to 2, and in the bottom of the ninth inning of game 6, Boston was
   ahead by a run and one out from their first championship since 1918.
   Mookie Wilson of the Mets hit a ground ball to first base that should have
   been a routine out.  But Buckner bobbled the ball, which dribbled between
   his legs and into right field, allowing the Mets to score two runs and win
   the game.  New York then won game 7 to take home the title.


Dale G. Abersold defends Buckner:  A couple of minor corrections: Buckner's
   misplay occurred in the bottom of the tenth inning, not the ninth.  Also,
   the first (and tying) run was scored on a wild pitch by Bob Stanley.  So
   even if he had got Mookie out, the game would simply have gone on to the
   eleventh inning.

   Buckner really got a bum rap in this series.  Sure, he *should* have caught
   that ball, but a greater portion of the blame should rest on the Boston
   pitchers.  After all, going into the bottom of the tenth inning, the Red
   Sox were ahead by two runs.  Calvin Schiraldi, however, allowed three
   consecutive singles (and one run), while Stanley threw the wild pitch,
   tying the game up.


John Gennaro:  To quickly add here, that Buckner was hobbled and should have
   been out for a defensive replacement.  He simply could not bend over for
   that ball and you can see it.


>> American Movie Classics

Joe Klemm discusses Marge's taste in romantic movies:  "Showgirls" is an
   extremely awful film about the world of Las Vegas showgirls.  A pure
   stinker, this film has been named by the Razzie Awards the Worst Film of
   1995. To make matter even worse, MGM, the distributors of film, launched an
   unsuccessful attempt to make "Showgirls" the next "Rocky Horror" and even
   came up with an audience participation script.


>> Coming soon:  The "American Pie" bear

Speaking of "Showgirls" and bears, Joe Klemm writes:  Livent is a Canadian
   company that began selling Beanie Babies to Broadway goers.  The Beanies
   they sell are official Ty Beanie Babies, each with a special ribbon the
   play that they represent.  The type of Beanie that is sold for each show
   depends on what happened in the show itself.  Among the musicals Livent has
   promoted include Phantom of the Opera, Ragtime, and Fosse.


>> In real life, you don't even get the damn T-shirt

Benjamin Robinson:  As the Persian Gulf Conflict wound down, it looked like
   the American military personnel would emerge relatively unscathed.
   Casualties from the fighting were light, the Iraqis surrendered quickly,
   and the enemy never got to deploy its much-feared reserves of chemical and
   biological weapons.  The story was not to end there, however.  Some
   soldiers began to complain of a collection of hard-to-pinpoint medical
   symptoms -- fatigue, pain, and malaise -- that they thought was related to
   their service in the Middle East.  They claim either they were exposed to
   biochemical agents without realizing it, or that our own counter-measures
   wound up triggering the disease (dubbed "Gulf War Syndrome").  The
   government claimed the soldiers were either suffering from some unrelated
   malady, or it was just in their heads.  The stonewalling continued until
   just recently, until Congress decided to set up a committee to study the
   matter.  Don't expect a quick resolution.


>> The ultimate SUV

That would be an Army tank.  Jeff Cross discusses the real-life incident that
   may have inspired Bart's rampage:  A few years back some wacko swiped an M-
   60 Sherman tank from a California National Guard base and went joyriding,
   with the cannon pointed straight back at the cops giving pursuit.  He was
   shot to death by police out of fear he'd actually blast something with the
   cannon.


Dean Humphries remembers:  Hey, we people of San Diego are proud of our late,
   lamented *Tank Man* (even to the point of T-shirts commemorating the event
   being made), I just missed crossing paths with him by a few minutes.
   Regrettably, as Bart was under the influence of drugs, so was Tank Man-a
   little too much crystal meth too many times.

>> The Attempted Murder of Homer J. Simpson

Chris Berry Jr.:  According to one of the many, many, many anarchic references
   at AnarchyRules.com (http://www.anarchyrules.com), a way to kill yourself
   is to give yourself an injection of oxygen. Apparently, the oxygen you pump
   in to your bloodstream will cause the blood vessels to swell. Once the
   swelling reaches your heart, you die.


>> Maybe they should have prescribed Viagra

Someone mysterious person, known only as "M7," writes:  Hey, I haven't been
   around for a LONG time, but I had to comment on a certain aspect of last
   night's show.  I've read all the reviews and recaps here (well, almost all)
   and no one has commented on the odd sexual undercurrent of last night's
   show.  It was as if they stuck something in for all sexual deviations every
   4 minutes or so.  For example

   1. Bart wearing the girl's cheerleader outfit.  (crossdressers)

   2. Homer wearing those cutoff jeans up to his crotch.  (gay)

   3. The Showgirls scene, with the girls in thongs just about to remove their
   tops.  (for us regular guys)

   4. Sideshow Mel in a dress with a hot woman's body.  (transsexuals)

   5. The two naked guys in the shower.  (gay)

   6. Bart stripped down to his underwear on the treadmill.  (pedophiles)


Scott Henrichs:  There were also a lot of sexual jokes.  Skinner saying all
   the fireman tools and Bart laughing at their names.  Bart's testicle joke.
   And of course, the chalkboard with the "Pork is not a verb".


Chris Palm:  There was some sort of food/sex joke, too.  [The butterscotch
   thing -- Ed.]  Marge mentioned a bar where men dance with each other.
   Those two scientists kissed.


>> Parade of Stars

Benjamin Robinson delivers quickie bios of people not mentioned so far:  Brett
   Butler -- Loose-cannon actress, who had her own show after "Roseanne" on
   ABC.  I think she used to go on drinking binges, among other things.  [{ol}
   adds, "the show she had came to an end when her on-set shenanigans got out
   of hand and she flashed a young co-star of hers."]

   Tim Allen -- "Home Improvement" star (also on ABC, hmmm) who was jailed for
   selling cocaine.  After release, he cleaned up his act and went into
   comedy.  The rest is history.  [{jc} adds, "[Allen] has also been arrested
   for DUI."]

   Andy Dick -- Was Matthew the spastic guy on "NewsRadio." Recently arrested
   for having drugs in his car.  [{jc} adds, "[He] is a confessed pothead,
   saying he's 'self-medicating with vitamin M.'"]

   Jewel -- Singer/songwriter, who also writes poetry.  Whether you think it's
   really terrible or really deep depends on how much of a Jewel (or poetry)
   fan you are.

   Mark McGwire -- Baseball player who hit 70 home runs last season, breaking
   Roger Maris' previously unassailable record of 61.


>> Priorities

Speaking of Mark McGwire, Andrew Nestler relates:  The February 24, 1999 USA
   Today includes an article on Mark McGwire, with the following quote:
   "McGwire would have accepted first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's invitation
   in January to the State of the Union address -- Sammy Sosa, who hit 66 home
   runs for the Chicago Cubs, was there -- but he already had committed to
   doing a voice-over for 'The Simpsons,' which airs in September."


>> On original staff and original vision

For the original version of this capsule, Capel Cleggs contributed a thought-
   provoking essay challenging a basic "old-school" tenet:  That the series
   changed for due to behind-the-scenes staffing changes.  Since then, we've
   gotten several good counterpoints, which we're publishing here.  [Some
   paragraphs have been reordered for clarity and flow, but are otherwise
   unchanged -- Ed.]


Capel Cleggs started with:  Nobody pointed out that the credited writer for
   this episode was George Meyer, who has been with the show since the first
   season but hasn't had solo credit on an episode since "Bart's Inner Child."

   In fact, I'd say anyone who says the "original writers" should come back
   isn't looking hard enough at the credits.  Meyer and Swartzwelder have
   always been there, but Mike Scully has clearly made an effort to hire back
   some of the original SIMPSONS people: he brought Al Jean back to the show,
   as well as David M. Stern, and even re-hired Larina Jean Adamson as the
   animation producer (those who are anal enough to notice these things will
   remember that she was animation producer for the first two seasons).


Ondre Lombard responds:  I have paid attention to the couple of people who
   have returned.  I'm still skeptical that the true person behind the
   "original vision" was James L. Brooks is still there.  The difference
   between now and then is Mike Scully is the captain of the show now, not
   him.  When he was, he had very intent designs on how the show was going to
   be.  And considering he was an Academy Award winning director behind such
   worthy material as "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "Terms of Endearment," I
   think his ideas gave Simpsons a more cinematic, real feel.  Without that,
   writers are just writers.  Myself, I eventually stopped infusing much
   importance into them anyway.


Capel Cleggs:  In fact, I think the toughest thing for many disappointed
   SIMPSON-ites to admit is that the current state of the series is pretty
   much the way the "original creators" want it to be.  Case in point: Matt
   Groening, in every recent interview I've seen with him, mentions that he's
   pleased with the current state of THE SIMPSONS and the "wacky, weird"
   episodes that Scully and co. have come up with.


Ondre Lombard:  Matt Groening is a goofy cartoonist by nature.  He probably
   didn't have anything to do with the sensitivity and emotional depth
   Simpsons had when it started.  James L. Brooks told him to create him a
   cartoon for The Tracey Ullman Show and he just created something in 15
   minutes.  Somehow, I don't think that his strong suit is much of anything
   else besides comedy.  So naturally I think he'd find this wackiness amusing
   (this all assuming MG isn't required to never speak ill against the show
   publicly.)


Seth Miller:  Your take on Matt Groening pisses me off.  His cartoons, the
   "Life in Hell" series, are FULL of emotional depth and sensitivity, a lot
   of which couldn't be expressed on a network or basic cable series, and not
   because of toilet humor, but because they probe human nature in a raw and
   unyielding way.  They aren't particularly goofy cartoons, either.  But
   WORST OF ALL, whilst panning the show, you have the gall to suggest that
   because all he is good for is "comedy", he presumably isn't sophisticated
   enough to appreciate the "sensitivity and emotional depth" that you, the
   learned viewer, so crave.


Alex Flandonwittsy:  I kind of agree with him.  For a man to write such an
   emotional ep as "Colonel Homer", and then to say he's proud of such filth
   as "Viva Ned Flanders" would maybe mean emotion isn't his main priority.
   Do I have a problem with that?  Not really, because there are others on
   staff who do consider sensitivity a main concern (again, I'm not saying MG
   isn't one of them).  Take care.  Good-day.


Ondre Lombard:  I suppose the way I meant to word it is that to him, maybe
   having absolutely no emotional depth and having nothing but caper'ish
   insanity is satisfactory enough for him. That doesn't necessarily mean he
   doesn't appreciate it.  Anyway, it is all a theory of mine since most of
   everything I've read about what made OFF so dramatic before had to do with
   Sam Simon and James L. Brooks.


Capel Cleggs:  Now, Groening isn't the sort of person who would shut up or lie
   when he doesn't like something; remember his reaction to that CRITIC
   crossover episode?  I think it's fair to assume that he is pleased with the
   show as it stands, because he says he is.

   Now, just because Groening likes the current SIMPSONS obviously doesn't
   mean you have to (or that I have to, for that matter).  But let's at least
   get it straight: Mike Scully and his crew have not violated a sacred trust,
   nor have they sold out to the demons of hell.  They've made a decision to
   make the show wackier, weirder, more anarchic.  Many long-running shows
   become stale because they keep focusing on the same basic personality
   traits and conflicts every week; I think that Scully is consciously trying
   to prevent that by focusing more on things that one might not expect to
   happen (though these "unpredictable" climaxes are themselves getting a bit
   predictable), rather than the stuff that was pretty much exhausted a few
   years back.  Now, I'm not saying this was the right approach to take; maybe
   a better way would have been to try and delve deeper into the characters,
   something like that.


Ondre Lombard:  If people here were actually growing tired of seeing stuff
   like "Lisa's Substitute" or "Life on the Fast Lane," they probably would've
   said so, instead of demanding more of it in place of insanity like "Maximum
   Homerdrive."


Capel Cleggs:  But the thing is: They're not creating shows just for "people
   here," but for the wider public that watches the show.  That means they
   have to balance the desire of some fans to see the show remain the same
   with the desire of other fans to see the show do new things.  Why should
   they do another "Lisa's Substitute," when they've done one already?  And if
   they went back to the old style, there would be plenty of people ready to
   point to that as evidence that the show had become stale and repetitive.
   Maybe the show went as far as it could with the "realistic" material. Not
   necessarily, but maybe.


Ondre Lombard:  Furthermore, is that really an excuse?  Show gets old, so you
   better start getting crazy?  That didn't work for "Roseanne" when it was
   nearing the end.  All the critics derided its reliance on out-there
   fantasy-reality after Roseanne won the lottery.  Simpsons is given other
   liberties because it's animated, and I find that to be wrong.  There are
   plenty of shows that kept their feet in reality, treated the characters as
   people rather than situational puppets and stayed brilliant for years
   ("M*A*S*H," "Cheers," "All in the Family," etc.)  OFF never -- never --
   indicated a need for a change in direction.  It was working quite well up
   until David Mirkin came along and, quite frankly, screwed it all up.

   And lastly, even if there is a need for change, that certainly can't
   account for the lack of creativity in the animation, the lack of
   emotionally manipulating camera angles and natural voice acting and natural
   jokes.  Or even sharp and witty jokes.  Much of them are explained to the
   audience. Simpsons was dumbed down -- not improved.


Capel Cleggs:  I think you're mistaken about Mirkin.  Here's a quote from an
   interview with Mirkin, circa 1995

   "Other people have told me the show became a little bit more story
   intensive when I came aboard.  The first season was very, very story
   oriented and very character oriented, but kind of slow moving in the first
   season.  Then the pace kept picking up for the second, third and fourth
   season, but by the third and fourth season it was going so fast that story
   got lost a little bit.  It was almost a series of events then a strong
   story.  I kind of brought it back and it was something that I wanted to do
   and Jim Brooks wanted to do.  Wanted to bring it back to more of a strong
   story-character through line and I think we did that."

   See, David Mirkin is often accused here of having emphasized character at
   the  expense of gags.  But when Mirkin was hired, Brooks told him that he
   wanted *more* emphasis on characterization and story than had been the rule
   in the fourth season, and by most accounts Brooks felt that Mirkin had
   helped to re-infuse the show with an emphasis on character.  And I think so
   too--if you take the later episodes of the fourth season, like "Marge In
   Chains" and "Cape Feare," and then compare the early Mirkin stuff like
   "Marge On the Lam" and "Rosebud," it seems obvious that Mirkin brought back
   some of the sentiment and sadness that had been missing when Jean and Reiss
   made the show lighter and wackier.  The fifth season's humor also
   recaptured some of the darkness of the first season--much more emphasis on
   Mr. Burns' cruelty and the danger of the power plant, for example.
   Furthermore, a lot of people praise the seventh season at the expense of
   the Mirkin era--forgetting that Mirkin had a lot of influence over the show
   in that season (there's an "assistant to Mr. Mirkin" credit at the end of
   every seventh-season episode), and that many of the scripts were probably
   commissioned by Mirkin, even though Oakley and Weinstein supervised the re-
   writing.  Nothing's quite so cut and dried, you see.

   Shows that stay fresh for more than five seasons are shows that change
   their style and approach periodically.  THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW morphed
   midway from the story of a spunky working woman into a workplace ensemble
   comedy.  SEINFELD in its later years got crazier and placed more emphasis
   on complicated, farcical plots; it was criticized for this, but Seinfeld
   and David realized that the show couldn't just go on exactly the way it did
   in the first few years.  And THE SIMPSONS couldn't--and shouldn't--be
   exactly what it was at the beginning, not without becoming a tired rehash
   of itself (not *another* episode where Homer learns to be a better
   father!).


Ondre Lombard:  Well, you must give me very little credit if you think I
   expect to see the same story over and over again.  Many classics of
   yesteryear did not line up perfectly in uniform.  What is the similarity
   between "Homer at the Bat" and "Simpson and Delilah?"  Or "One Fish, Two
   Fish, Blow Fish, Blue Fish" and "Bart the Daredevil?"  I expect certain
   tones and directions to be APPLIED to whatever fresh and original idea is
   being tackled.  And it isn't as if the show doesn't repeat itself now.  The
   crazy twists at the end of every episode does not cover up the hum-drum,
   routine over-exercise of certain styles and plot ideas.  How many damn
   times are we gonna see Homer get into some insane, unreasonable job and
   cause other people anguish and grief?  I think we've seen that more than
   we've ever seen Homer "try to be a good father."  And aren't there other
   Simpsons characters by the way?


Dale G. Abersold:  The show has become a tired rehash of its post-1994 self.
   Not another episode where Homer gets a new job and aggressively learns
   nothing!


Capel Cleggs:  True enough, and I think the show has reached a point where it
   needs to shift its focus a bit.  We'll see if this season fits the bill.

   I'm saying that these people [Mirkin, et al] aren't evil slobs out to
   destroy your favorite show.  Many of them are among the people who made it
   your favorite show in the first place.  Criticize what they're doing, but
   *criticize*, rather than name-calling.


Ondre Lombard:  That, I can agree with.  It doesn't make things any better or
   worse to hurl names.  Constructive criticism is what separates the
   thoughtful observer from the whiner.


[At this point, we'll consider the debate closed, and add no further comment
   to this section -- Ed.]


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Rain Bart


Mike Erickson:  Bart says NO to drugs, which I though was a good message ...
   considering that a study came out last week that kids aged 8-16 thought
   Bart was one of the top 5 role models on TV.  What's funny was that
   everyone around him wanted him to take the drugs.


Joe Klemm:  Spice is one of those adult pay-per-view channels that appear on
   cable.  Like most adult channels, Spice is regular PPV channels in the day
   hours, but begin to air TVMA programs once it reaches the 10:oo PM hour.


Haynes Lee contributes these next two items:  .li Bart most likely inherited
   A.D.D. from Homer who shows all the classic symptoms of A.D.D. and
   dyslexia.

   Bart's comment that he now uses 10% of his brain capacity is believed to be
   false.  See <http://www.urbanlegends.com/science/10_percent_of_brain.html>


Bill McNeal:  We see a drawing of the animated Dennis the Menace [when the
   Marge describes Bart for the cops].  Former Simpsons actor(I-call-God) Phil
   Hartman was the voice of Henry Mitchell on that series. Hartman also
   occasionally played Mr. Wilson, but the primary vocalist for Wilson was
   Maurice LaMarche of Futurama.  [In addition,] Andy Dick is mentioned, who
   co-starred with Phil Hartman on NewsRadio.


Robert Todd:  On the climbing frame millhouse mentions that he takes Claritin.
   [This is] a Hay Fever treatment.  [I think it's useful for other allergies,
   as well -- Ed.]

==============================================================================
% At Springfield Elementary, the kids are taking a break from their
% usual lessons to study fire safety.  In the playground, several pro-
% safety exhibits have been set up.  Principal Skinner mans a display of
% fire-fighting equipment and takes questions from the students.  Like,
% for example, Bart and Lisa Simpson.

Lisa:     Principal Skinner, what would you say is the most important
          fire-fighting tool?  Would you say it's prevention?
Skinner:  Oh, absolutely, Lisa.  That, and the sand bucket.
Bart:     [pointing to some of the equipment]  What's that stuff?
Skinner:  Why, this is retardant.
Bart:     [laughs]  Sure is.  Hey, what's that?  [picks up some
          equipment]
Skinner:  That's called a hose lengthener.
Bart:     [laughs]  You need one.
Skinner:  G'oh!
Bart:     What's this?
Skinner:  Just read the label.  It's a king-sized flamer!
Bart:     [laughs uproariously]
Skinner:  Bart, will you go bother someone else?
Bart:     Look!  A fire!  [Skinner looks over at Bart]
          Engine.
Skinner:  Stop that.
Bart:     Help!  Help!  Fire ... helmets.  [shows some on the truck]
Skinner:  Can't you do something constructive?
Bart:     Sure, I can do something destructive.  [runs off]
Willie:   [walking up to Skinner, and carrying a hoe]  Just say the
          word, and I'll bury this hoe in his back.  I can make it look
          like suicide.

% Hosey the Bear has also shown up, to dispense fire safety tips.
% Ralph seems to have mistaken him for someone else, though.

Ralph:    And I want a bike, and a monkey, a friend for the
          monkey ...
Hosey:    You're not going to start any fires, are you?
Ralph:    At my house, we call them, "uh-ohs."

% Meanwhile, Milhouse pets the Springfield VFD's mascot Dalmatian.
% When he asks if the dog can do any tricks, Moe explains that the pooch
% "is so inbred he can barely stand up."  The dog falls down on cue.
%
% At another part of the school, the children -- some of them, anyway -
% - have gathered to watch a skit on fire safety.  Skinner walks onstage
% to introduce the play.

Skinner:  Fire can be our servant, whether it's toasting s'mores, or
          raining down on Charlie.  But it can turn not-so-nice, as
          you'll see in this skit by the volunteer fire department
          players.
          [the curtains part, revealing a hippie "crash pad."  Ned and
          Maude Flanders, dressed in late-60s attire, open the door and
          walk in]
Ned:      What a great pot party!
Maude:    Wasn't it, man?
Ned:      Now for a regular cigarette to make the night complete.
          [lights one, takes a drag, and coughs]  Oh, man that's good.
Maude:    Mad Dog, I've been thinking.  Maybe we should get another
          smoke detector in case that one trips out on us.
Ned:      [laughs]  Why bother, baby.  One smoke detector's enough for
          Mad Dog.  Now let's hit the sack.
          [they both lie down in bed.  In short order, Ned -- er-- Mad
          Dog's cigarette sets his pants aflame]
          Whoa, check it out!  Mad Dog's on fire!
Maude:    Stop, drop, and roll, man!
Ned:      Ha, ha, ha, that's for clydes, baby.  A little fire can't
          hurt you.
          [the curtains close.  Apu walks onstage to address the
          audience]
Apu:      But Mad Dog was wrong.  The fire burned through the night and
          cost him the use of his pants.  Which just goes to show you
          ...
          [Ned pokes his head from behind the curtain]
Ned:      Sorry to break character, but these stunt pants are getting
          mighty toasty!
Maude:    Uh, roll, Neddie, roll.
          [does so]
Ned:      It's not working -- it just spreads the flames!
-- When Fire Safety Skits Go Wrong, "Brother's Little Helper"

% The firemen run to get the hose, but discover that it's leading to
% the gymnasium.  The doors burst open, and a great wave of water bursts
% forth.  Bart surfs on top of the wave, using a basketball backboard as
% a makeshift surfboard.  Skinner and the others are swept away.  (At
% least the water extinguishes Ned.)  Skinner yells at the boy, but Bart
% is nonchalant as usual.
%
% Skinner isn't taking things so gracefully, though, and calls Homer
% and Marge in to school.  After punching a pop-up clown balloon for
% stress relief, he gets down to business.

Skinner:    Thank you for coming.
Homer:      Thank you for getting me out of work.
Skinner:    I'll be blunt -- Bart's latest escapade goes far beyond the
            realm of the hi-jink.
            [cut to the gymnasium, where Willie blow-dries the floor.
            In spite of his efforts, the floor has warped, and it now
            has large hummocks in it]
Willie:     There, now the floor is as good as new.
            [some kids are playing basketball.  Nelson tries to throw a
            bounce pass to Wendell, but the ball takes a crazy bounce
            and hits Milhouse in the face]
Milhouse:   My sports goggles!
            [back to the principal's office]
Skinner:    Your son is a ravenous demon, relentlessly gnawing at all
            that's good and true.
Homer:      Yeah, he's something else, all right.
Skinner:    But worst of all, he drags down the grades of anyone who
            sits near him.  Just look at this pattern.

            Bart's face.  Immediately surrounding him are "D"s and
            "F"s.  At the perimeter, are "A"s and "B"s]
Homer:      [giggles]  Hey, that looks like Bart.
Skinner:    And turning to the 3-D map, we see an unmistakable cone of
            ignorance.
            [produces a model that looks like a black-hole map, with
            schooldesks stuck to it.  The center of the "hole" is where
            Bart's seat would normally be]
Marge:      [flinching]  Put it away!  Put it away!
Skinner:    Very well, but there's no escaping the truth.  Bart has a
            classic case of attention deficit disorder.
Marge:      You mean like John Leguizamo?
Skinner:    How should I know?  The point is, ADD makes children
            restless and easily distracted.
Homer:      [uses the model as a megaphone]  Hi Marge, it's me, Homer.
            [Skinner clears his throat]  What?  Time to go?
Skinner:    Please, Mr. Simpson.  I'm afraid I'll have to expel your
            son, [Marge gasps] unless you're willing to try a radical,
            untested, potentially dangerous ...
Homer:      Candy bar?
Skinner:    No.  It's a new drug, called Focusyn.
Marge:      A drug?  I know Bart can be rambunctious, but he's not some
            hyperactive monster.
            [suddenly Bart appears in the window, dressed in
            cheerleader garb]
Bart:       Gimme an "F!"  Gimme an "art!"
Skinner:    Good Lord!  He's gotten into the pep closet.
Homer:      I'd say he's coming out of the pep closet.  [chuckles]
-- Father's pride and joy, "Brother's Little Helper"

% Homer and Marge decide to pay a visit to The Pharm Team, makers of
% Focusyn.  Two pharmacists take them on a tour.

Marge:      I don't want to pump my little boy full of drugs.
Pharm. 1:   Yeah, yeah, we get a lot of that.
Pharm. 2:   But then they see our results.
            [shows the Simpsons some guinea pigs, running around in a
            cage like idiots]
Pharm. 1:   These are normal guinea pigs, running around like idiots.
            Now I'll give them some Focusyn.
            [spritzes some of the drug on them.  The become docile, and
            run into an adjoining cage.  The second cage has rows of
            schooldesks in it, and the guinea pigs take their seats]
Marge:      That's amazing -- and darling.
Pharm. 2:   Check this out.  [puts on a guinea pig hand puppet (with a
            mortarboard on its head), and sticks it in the cage.  The
            eyes of the drugged pigs follow its every move]
Homer:      They've become your slaves.
Pharm. 2:   Yes, but it's not about slavery, it's about helping kids
            concentrate.  This pill reduces class clownism 44%.
Pharm. 1:   With 60% less sass-mouth.
Pharm. 2:   The only thing more effective is regular exercise.

% jar of Focusyn that happens to be sitting nearby, gobbles several
% pills, and then runs out the door]

Marge:      Stop him!  He's whacked out of his gourd.
Pharm. 1:   Don't worry, we have a procedure for these situations.
            [pushes button, and a big container labeled, "Valium"
            descends from the ceiling above Homer and Marge.  Two
            hypodermic needles come down from the sides and inject the
            two]
Marge:      [relieved] Ahhh.
Homer:      Hey, there was just air in mine.  [clutches chest and
            collapses]
-- The situation is well in hand, "Brother's Little Helper"

% [End of Act Two:  Time:  14:27]
%
% Marge and Homer waste no time in searching for their son.  The first
% step is to alert the police, and Marge gives a description of Bart to
% the Springfield police.  She describes Bart as being tow-headed, with
% a button nose and mischievous smile.  The police quickly produce an
% accurate drawing ... of Dennis "the Menace" Mitchell.  "Looks like the
% kid who roughed up the Wilson widow," concludes Chief Wiggum.
%
% Marge frets that Bart is in the hot sun without the benefit of his
% sombrero.  Homer is more worried about some of the side effects listed
% on the Focusyn bottle, which include paranoid behavior and diarrhea.
%
% Meanwhile, Bart (suffering from a facial tic, but not diarrhea) slips
% onto the grounds of Fort Fragg, an army base near Springfield.  Inside
% one of the barracks, two soldiers take showers.

Soldier 1:  I can't believe that Sarge said we're the worst bunch he's
            ever seen.
Soldier 2:  See I have to believe he's seen worse bunches than us.
Soldier 1:  But he said --
Soldier 2:  I know what he said.  He was just trying to motivate us.
Soldier 1:  Well, it ruined the whole hike.
            [Bart sneaks into the shower room, and goes through the
            soldiers' pants.  He retrieves a set of keys, chuckles
            evilly, and sneaks out]
Soldier 1:  Do you think Alex would mind if I asked Janet out?
Soldier 2:  They're married, idiot!
Soldier 1:  Why'd you have to yell?  You ruined the whole shower.
-- The sensitive soldier, "Brother's Little Helper"

% Homer looks through town for his son, but is sidetracked at Moe's
% tavern.  Marge sticks her head in the door, and tells her husband to
% focus on finding Bart.  Homer assures Marge he's on top of it, since
% he has a trap baited with Focusyn.
%
% But despite their efforts, the Simpsons can find neither hide nor
% hair of Bart.

Marge:    Mmmm, my sweet baby.  He must feel so helpless and scared.
          [or maybe not, for we cut to a scene of Him driving one of
          Ft. Fragg's tanks, crushing everything in his path]
Bart:     [singing] Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
          Don't stop, it'll soon be here ...
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% Burns spies Bart with his binoculars.

Burns:      Smithers, we're at war!
Smithers:   I'll begin profiteering, sir.
Burns:      And hoarding.  Leave it to the Democrats to let the
            Spaniards back in the pantry.
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% Bart drives past The Android's Dungeon, leaving a wake of crushed
% cars and signs.

Comic Book Guy: Egad -- a maniac cutting a swath of destruction!  This
                is a job for the Green Lantern, Thundra, or possibly
                ... Ghost Writer.
Otto:           Well, what about Superman?
Comic Book Guy: Oh, please.
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% The tank bears down on Krusty's clown car.  With no time to drive out
% of the way, Krusty orders everyone inside to make a break for it.  In
% the best clown tradition, an entire troop files out of the tiny
% automobile.  The last guy, Sir Widebottom, gets his bottom stuck in
% the door.  The tank runs over the car, deflating Widebottom's
% inflatable posterior.  He is alive, although he wonders why.
%
% The tank bursts through the Springfield bookmobile, to the approval
% of the town's children.  The police are hot on his trail.  Wiggum
% orders Lou to shoot the tires out, but is annoyed when Lou points out
% that won't work on a tank.
%
% Bart rolls into the schoolyard at Springfield Elementary.

What a day!  First the drinking fountain squirts me, and now this.
-- Principal Skinner, after a tank plows through the schoolyard,
   "Brother's Little Helper"

% The rest of the Simpsons have also arrived at SES.  Marge stands in
% the path of the tank, in a bid to keep Bart from ramming the school.

Homer:    My God, is she brave, standing up to that freaked-out junkie.
Lisa:     Dad, that junkie is your son.
Homer:    Why don't you just tell everybody?
          [the tank comes to a halt just inches from Marge]
Bart:     Hey, Mom.  Thanks for coming out.
Marge:    Oh, thank you for stopping the tank.
Bart:     It ran out of gas.
Marge:    Oh ... so Bart?
Bart:     Question.
Marge:    How about getting out of the tank, eh?  Maybe stopping your
          rampage, eh?  We could go to Krustyburger.
Bart:     Okay, sure.
Marge:    Whew.
Bart:     Right after I blow up one thing.  [goes back inside the tank]
Marge:    Ohh ...
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% The tank's turret swivels and points its gun barrel toward the
% school.

Skinner:       [gasps]  Good Lord!  He's going to fire!
Jimbo:         All right!  Scud the school, dude!
Krabappel:     [flatly]  No.  Stop.  Think of the children.
               [the turret points toward the church]
Lovejoy:       Not the church!  Jesus lives there!
               [Bart switches aim toward a frame shop]
Homer:         The frame store!  You monster!
               [now the gun points toward the sky]
Sideshow Mel:  Not the sky!  That's where clouds are born!
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% But the sky it is.  Bart fires, and shortly thereafter a burning
% satellite crashes to the earth.  The Springfield VFD swiftly arrives
% at the scene.

Moe:      A satellite?  What do we do?  What do we do?
Ned:      [thumbs through manual]  Discotheques, Frathouses, Malibu[?]
          -- nothing about satellite fires.
Apu:      Let's just spray it with water, already.
          [does so, and puts the fire out]
-- "Brother's Little Helper"

% Wiggum hauls Bart out of the tank.

Wiggum:     That's the end of your Loony Tune, Drugs Bunny.  You're
            under arrest for astro-vandalism.
Moe:        And may God help you if that thing carried the Spice
            Channel.
            [Marge walks up to the satellite wreckage, and spots the
            MLB logo]
Marge:      Major League Baseball?
Bart:       I told you they were monitoring my activities.
Lenny:      [opens the satellite, and pulls a printout from inside]
            He's right -- this thing's got info on everybody.
            Addresses, credit ratings, what size baseball hat they
            wear.
Computer:   Surveillance beam disabled.  Marketing research, shutting
            down.  Doesn't that beat all?
            [a helicopter lands nearby, and a man steps out]
McGwire:    Hi, folks!  I'm Mark McGwire.
Computer:   Big Mac himself.  Who'd have thunk it?
McGwire:    Young Bart here is right.  We are spying on you, pretty
            much around the clock.
Bart:       But why, Mr. McGwire?
McGwire:    Do you want to know the terrifying truth, or do you want to
            see me sock a few dingers?
Crowd:      Dingers!  Dingers!
            [McGwire hits the long ball]
            Oooh!
McGwire:    [takes printout]  Yoink!
            [tucks it under his hat and looks around, suspiciously]
-- Someone call Fox Mulder, "Brother's Little Helper"

% At the Simpson residence, things seem to have returned to normal.

Lisa:     [hugs Bart] It's good to have the old Bart back.  Plus, he's
          exposed the disturbing unreadiness of today's army.
Marge:    Oh, Bart, I'm so sorry we sent you on that psychotropic
          hayride.
Bart:     At least I got to see some cool colors.
Homer:    And Mark McGwire gave you an autographed bat.
          [holds up a bat, which has McGwire's signature and the number
          70 (commemorating the number of home runs he hit in one year)
          on it]
Lisa:     Why is the zero made of glass?
          [cut to a shot from behind the glass.  We can see the family
          in fisheye view.  Demographic information appears on the
          screen]
Homer:    Who cares?  That man can really slug.
          [cut to normal view]
Marge:    Well, I'm not going to give my baby any more dangerous drugs.
          From now on, it's nothing but fresh air, lots of hugs, and
          good old-fashioned Ritalin.
          [hands Bart some Ritalin]
Bart:     You said a mouthful.  [takes pills]
          [singing to the tune of "Popeye, the Sailor Man"]
          When I can't stop my fiddlin'
          I just takes me Ritalin
          I'm poppin' and sailin', man!
          [two toots of steam come out his ears]
-- He yis what he yis, "Brother's Little Helper"

% Iris out on Bart.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time:  20:14]
%
% The closing sound bite is the Gracie Lady "Shh," followed by the
% first Soldier saying, "Oh why'd you have to shush?  You ruined the
% whole show."
