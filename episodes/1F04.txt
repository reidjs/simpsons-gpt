Gravestones:- Elvis -- Accept It

           :- A Balanced Budget

           :- Subtle Political Satire

           :- TV Violence (gets riddled by bullets)

Couch      :- The undead Simpson family enter through the living room

===============================================================================
> Did you notice...
===============================================================================
    ... the creature that serves Homer the donut has a "Hell's Kitchen"
        apron on?
    ... Lionel Hutz combing his hair with a fork?
    ... Bart gets taken away to the "New Bedlam Mental Hospital"?
    ... Eddie the cop burning the Mona Lisa?
    ... Vampire Burns' shadow forms a "cat's cradle" with string and
        plays with a yoyo briefly?
    ... the title of Burns' book is, "Yes, I Am a Vampire" with a
        foreword was by Steve Allen?

Ron Carter:
    ... Bart gets an "F+" grade on his test on the fridge?
    ... the whole first part is a take-off of "The Devil and Daniel
        Webster", and Lionel Hutz refers to Webster's dictionary?
    ... the space alien laughs just like Charles Nelson Reilly?

Don Del Grande:
    ... in Bart's dream, Lisa isn't on the bus?
    ... the chairs with extremely tall backs in the Burns mansion
        include a high chair with tray?
    ... the vampires' fangs extend and retract inside their mouths?
    ... when Marge asks if everybody had washed their necks, Maggie
        raises her hand?
    ... when Bart turns into a bat and leaves Lisa's room, Maggie waves
        goodbye?

Juha Terho:
    ... Homer wears glasses at the beginning of "The Devil and Homer
        Simpson"?
    ... Ned's glasses slip down when he says "It's always the one you
        least suspect"?
    ... the donut plate from Hell floats in mid-air?
    ... Ned's trident changes into a plunger when he pushes Homer
        through the floor?
    ... the only words that are visible in the contract Ned shows during
        the trial are "Homer Simpson" and "doughnut" - probably meaning
        it was a ready form to be filled: "I, ______ pledge my soul for
        the devil for a ______"?

Ricardo Lafaurie:
    ... you can make out "The Devil" when Maggie pops the pacifier into
        Bart's mouth?
    ... in the last frame of the Devil Flanders' disappearance, you can
        see Flanders' normal face?
    ... Blackbeard talks like Captain McAllister?
    ... the air-horn sounds like the horn of the truck in Bart's dream?
    ... the filth on Homer's neck?
    ... Bart does a twitch when he says "blood"?

Homer and Marge weren't married in Springfield (8F10), but the picture
at the hospital has a young Rev. Lovejoy and Dr. Hibbert in it.  {ddg}.

Before Milhouse goes to sit with Uter, the latter is sitting in the
aisle seat.  In the next shot, Uter is sitting in the window seat.

When the gremlin is unscrewing the lugs nuts on the wheel, (1) The lugs
are not in the center of the wheel, so the gremlin's hand and arm should
jerk around when unscrewing the lug, (2) he removes them from the left
(driver's) side of the bus which would serve to *tighten* the lug
instead of loosen it.  {gtm}

Lisa refers to vampires as "the walking undead", yet mummies are just as
much "walking undead" (the walking ones, anyway) as vampires.  {ddg}

Despite Burns' fangs being well separated, the bite marks are next to
each other on Bart's neck.  {ddg}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Ron Carter: It averages out to an B+ (an A, a B, and another A) I think.
    In the opening, the gravestones were off (not OFF), too serious.
    Liked the "Night Gallery" theme a lot; took long enough.  The
    Devil..." was superb, wish they had done more with the jury, but
    with time constraints.  Note the Devil (aka Flanders) moving his
    tail in the kitchen scene.  Nice.  "Terror..." was the weakest, but
    some nice touches here and there.  "Bart Simpson's..." was
    beautiful.  Cuts were expert.  Funny stuff.  The ending was
    hilarious, unexpected, and great since I was hoping to have another
    "Peanuts" opening.

Joseph Reeves: Wow!  I think this is one of the best episodes
    (Hallowe'en, at least)!  Not as good as the second, but still, quite
    good.  The most pleasing aspect of this show is that some of the
    stories were actually a little scary.  I mean I wasn't like crying
    from fear, but the Dracula and 5 1/2 feet sections were so well done
    that there was a lot of tension and fear.  Besides, it's about time
    Lisa got really involved in one of the episodes!

Raymond Chen: This year's Hallowe'en episode was definitely an
    improvement over last year's.  But you just can't top Treehouse 1.
    The Original Space Aliens.  Wild directorial decisions.  Vortices
    into another dimension.  And, of course, the pen of author and
    troubled soul Edgar Allen Poe.

Andrew Ross: I think they must spend the whole year planning the annual
    Halloween show.  It never fails!  Wonderful, most wonderful!  The
    funny parts, so you know what you should have laughed at: Best part:
    NO RAKES!  [...] Everything else was funny too.  Truly a great
    episode!

Scott Mankey: I thought this was a great episode and enjoyed it very
    much.  I give it an "A".  Lots of great lines like: "Kill my boss?
    Do I dare live out the American dream?"  And after Homer can't pull
    the "Super Fun Happy Slide" handle, he tries to console himself with
    "I guess killing will be fun enough."

Joey Berner: Well, this one was far better than last year.  The "Devil"
    episode had some GREAT gags (Homer eating his donut head - who in
    the hell came up with that?!), the "Nightmare" was a nice Twilight
    Zone spoof even though I thought it was the weakest of the three (it
    was still very well done) and the "Dracula" one was classic.  All in
    all, the animation in this one has been the best so far this season.
    Some great lines, fantastic animation and a nice return to the
    Simpsons we know and love....

Juha Terho: Incredible.  The animation was best ever, the stories were
    great, so was the pacing, beautiful gags, and above all, the
    atmosphere was tremendous.  This is even better than the first
    Halloween Special, and it's definitely one of the three episodes
    that get an A+ from me.  I thought every story in here was worth an
    A+.

Yours truly: Outstanding episode.  Probably one of my new all-time
    favorites.  Plots were awesome, and the animation was outrageously
    excellent: lots of thunder and lightning, shadows, smooth changes of
    vampires to bats, etc.  And humorous references to previous
    episodes: aliens in spaceship, whipping donuts at old people, New
    Bedlam Mental Hospital, etc.  Yep, I give it an A+.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> The "Ironic Punishments" room in hell

Alan Asper says, "The whole `ironic punishments' thing is based on
    Dante's `Inferno', in which sinners go to hell to face punishments
    analogous to what they did in Life.  For example, adulterers are
    condemned to spend eternity in a whirlwind because in Life they were
    swept away by passion (so to speak).  I forget what Circle of Hell
    the doughnut machine is in, however..."

Tom Collins notes that this room is also based on Jimmy Halto's long-
    running comic "Halto's Inferno."  Furthermore, the title of the
    Warner Brothers' cartoon to which this scene refers, "Pigs is Pigs",
    "is from a classic humorous story by Ellis Parker Butler.  It's even
    been filmed under the same name."

>> Who is James Coco?

Homer's tormentor in hell says, "James Coco went mad in fifteen
    minutes!"  Steve Portigal explains, "James Coco was an (at times)
    respected actor, who also was famous for his weight, and perhaps
    appetite.  He was in lots of films, including a Don Quixote version.
    The last things I remember him doing was playing the lovable
    criminal uncle of Tony Micelli on `Who's the Boss?'  When he died,
    they had a sad maudlin episode about how much they loved him."

>> The jurors in "The Devil and Daniel Webster"

Comparing the jurors in the original versus that in the Simpsons, Andrew
    Ross comments, "Arnold and Blackbeard were in the original.  None of
    the others had yet achieved notoriety in Daniel Webster's day (pre-
    civil war, don't you know).  The rest of Benet's jury of the damned
    included such relatively obscure people as Simon Girty, a renegade
    who hunted people, Governor Dale, a notorious Draconian who broke
    men on the wheel, and Gallatin the scalp hunter.  The Judge was
    Justice Hathorne, of Salem witch trials fame.  I doubt these names
    would mean much to the average TV viewer, so it's just as well OFF
    substituted some more modern villains."

>> Homer's detachable head

Don Del Grande writes, "I'm not sure about this one...but according to
    an article in TV GUIDE, Matt Groening said there was supposed to be
    a scene in TDAHS where the demons bowl using Homer's head; this may
    have been written into the spot just before the trial begins and
    Homer appears in the cage with his head detached."

>> The 1976 Philadelphia Flyers

Michael Welch says, "The Philadelphia Flyers of the 1970's were probably
    the most notoriously dirty (physical, if you're a Philly fan) teams
    in NHL history."  Carl Frank adds, "They were nicknamed `The Broad
    Street Bullies' and they were assessed (as a team) what I recall to
    be a record number of penalty minutes over the course of the season.
    They did quite well that year, but the complaint was that it was
    less by way of talent and more of intimidation.  The fact that they
    were the damned was *great*."

>> Exploding objects

Juha Terho lists the following previous explosions:

    - [8F15] The punchbuggy hits a milk truck
    - [9F02] A capsule of "The Paralyzer" carnival machine hits
      Springfield Elementary
    - [9F09] Hans Moleman crashes down a hill with the birthplace of
      Edgar Allan Poe
    - [9F14] Chief Wiggum hits a tree as "Giant Beer"

>> Ren and Stimpy reference?

Some people theorize that Uter, the foreign exchange student, and his
    candies were a reference to "Ren and Stimpy".  Uter looks like Ren
    Hoek's cousin, Sven; the close-ups on the candy were reminiscent of
    R&S close-ups; and Matt Groening is known to be a big fan of Ren and
    Stimpy.

>> The "Vengelerstrasse Bar"

Tom Collins says that "Vengelerstrasse" translates into English as
    "Butterfinger", which is, of course, humorous considering that the
    Simpsons endorse this particular brand of candy bar.  Apparently
    Matt Groening loves them, which is why he let the Simpsons endorse
    them.

>> Finally, what a rear admiral really is!

James Cherry explains:  OK, so everyone was asking what the hell a rear
    admiral was.  Bill Oakley, who _wrote_ that part of the script with
    Josh Weinstein, emailed me the definitive answer as to what a rear
    admiral is.

    >Regarding "Rear Admiral,"  I think the answer is probably as
    >disappointing as you feared it might be:  it doesn't exist.  Here is
    >the actual first draft script excerpt from the Halloween show:
    >
    >        BART
    >Milhouse.  Milhouse, wake up.  Quick, look out the window.
    >        MILHOUSE
    >No way, Bart.  If I lean over and put my face against the window,
    >you're gonna smash it, or maybe pinch my butt real hard.
    >
    >This was the first draft.  In re-writing it, the writers wanted to go
    >for something a little funnier, something that would sound like it was
    >from the family of "flying wedgie," "purple nurple," etc.  Someone, I
    >do not remember who, said "Rear Admiral."  It sounds real, having the
    >word "rear" in it, but it was manufactured to sound real.  As far as we
    >know, it doesn't really exist.

>> More running gags

Andrew Ross lists the following running gags:

    - Wet pants on Halloween (compare Bart's line, "I hope this is
      sweat" with last year's Bart: "This one will scare you so much
      you'll wet your pants!"  Abe: "Too late.")
    - Nelson's laugh (unexpected and hilarious)
    - The demon running the conveyor belt in Hell is one of the Happy
      Little Elves.  I always thought there was something sinister about
      them...
    - Grandpa's pathos
    - The exploding car (a reference to itself; Hans comes to a complete
      stop inches away from the tree, *then* blows up gratuitously!)
    - Krusty's senseless mercantilism (the trading cards)
    - Homer's appetite (he can fit four donuts at a time into his
      mouth!)
    - Burns on the monitor, asking who *is* that man, Smithers.  Only
      this time, he's not asking`about Homer.

% Bart strolls through a gallery of paintings.

 Bart: Paintings: lifeless images rendered in colorful goop.  But at
       night, they take on a life of their own.  They become portals to
       hell, so scary and horrible and gruesome that --
Marge: Bart!  You should warn people this episode is very frightening.
       And maybe they'd rather listen to that old "War of the Worlds"
       broadcast on NPR, hmm?
 Bart: Yes, mother.
-- There's a good boy, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Marge gives Maggie to Bart so that she can buy some earrings at the
% gift shop.

The subject of our first painting tonight is the most foul, evil,
vicious, diabolical beast to stalk the earth.  Of course I refer to...
 [Maggie stuffs her pacifier in Bart's mouth]
...mm mm-mmm!
 [Bart spits it out]
...the devil!
-- Bart, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The title "The Devil and Homer Simpson" appears in front of the
% painting, which depicts Satan's head.
%
% The scene changes to a runway.  The announcer tells of the next item
% in their fall catalogue, "A vision in raspberry cream."  A model's
% shapely legs make their way down the runway.  At the end, we see Homer
% looking up delightedly at the donut atop the legs: "Pure genius!"  He
% drools.
%
% But alas, it was all a dream.  Homer awakes to find himself at the
% power plant in front of a box of donuts.  "And now to make the leap
% from dreams to reality," he says, hungrily opening the box.  But the
% box is empty, devoid of donuts!

Lenny: Sorry, Homer.  While you were daydreaming we ate all the donuts.
 Carl: Well, there were a few left, but we chucked them at an old man
       for kicks.
        [Shot of Abe running with a donut stuck to his head]
  Abe: Damn buzzards!  I ain't dead yet.
-- Knockin' on heaven's door, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Homer panics a little, running back to his work station.  "Stay calm,"
% he reassures himself, "remember your training."  He reaches for the
% "Emergency Procedures" manual, and opens it up.  A square has been cut
% out of most of the pages -- a square big enough to hold a solitary
% donut.  But Homer finds no donut; all that's left is a piece of paper.
% Homer reads it.

"Dear Homer, I. O. U. one emergency donut.  Signed, Homer."
Bastard!  He's always one step ahead.
-- Homer, not realizing his own foresight, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% He contemptuously tears the note to shreds, and rues his misfortune.

   Homer: [ruefully] I'd sell my soul for a donut.
           [The devil appears, looking like Flanders]
Flanders: Heh heh, that can be arranged.
   Homer: What -- Flanders!  You're the devil?
Flanders: Ho ho, it's always the one you least suspect.
-- All those wasted years of church, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Flanders wants to ensure Homer means what he said.

Flanders: Many people offer to sell their souls without reflecting on
          the grave ramifications --
   Homer: [impatiently] _Do_ you have a donut or not?
Flanders: Comin' up.  Just sign here.  Careful, hot pen!
-- Desperation calls for drastic measures, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Homer signs away his soul, being careful not to burn himself on the
% flaming pen.  Burns and Smithers watch the transaction.

   Burns: Hmm...who's that goat-legged fellow?  I like the cut of his
          jib.
Smithers: Er, Prince of Darkness, sir.  He's your eleven o'clock.
-- The next installment on the billion, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The devil makes it so!  A whinnying apparition with a "Hell's Kitchen"
% apron procures a single donut for Mr. Simpson.

Flanders: Now remember, the instant you finish it, I own your soul for
          --
   Homer: [through a full mouth] Hey, wait: if I don't finish this last
          bite, you don't get my soul, do you?
Flanders: Well, technically, no, but --
   Homer: [gloating] I'm smarter than the devil!
-- I know you are but what am I?, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Flanders doesn't like Homer's gloating, and he turns into a fearsome
% beast, promising to see Homer in hell yet.  He disappears back into
% the ground in a ball of flame, but Homer's not worried.  "Not likely,"
% he giggles, putting the last little piece in his shirt pocket.
%
% That night, Homer wanders out of bed half-asleep, looking for
% something to eat.  He opens the fridge and looks at all the leftovers,
% but his eyes are drawn to the little piece of donut despite all the
% signs warning him he's not supposed to eat it.  He tosses it into his
% mouth.  "Mmm, forbidden donut."
%
% The minute he swallows it, the devil appears.  "Well, well: finishing
% something?"  A hole of fire appears in the kitchen floor, and Homer is
% drawn towards it.  He grabs onto the fridge door, clinging desperately
% to it as the suction becomes more powerful.  Marge comes in to see
% what the commotion is about, and her hair gets sucked towards the
% peephole to hell.
%
% Homer's not strong enough, and he gets drawn in.  But he gets stuck
% halfway.  "Your wide behind won't save you this time!" warns the
% devil.  Bart and Lisa walk in as well, and the devil says
% nonchalantly, "Hey Bart."  Lisa sees what's about to happen.

    Lisa: Wait!  Doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial?
Flanders: Oh, you Americans with your due process and fair trials.  This
          is always so much easier in Mexico.
-- Only until NAFTA comes in, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% But the devil acquiesces to Lisa's wishes.  He promises that the trial
% will be at the stroke of midnight, and that meanwhile Homer must spend
% the day in hell.  His trident turns into a plunger and he forces
% Homer's mass down through the floor.  Homer himself plunges down into
% the fiery abyss.
%
% He lands at the bottom on a conveyer belt.  "That wasn't so bad," he

% In the room with a "Hell Labs: Ironic Punishments Division" sign on
% the door, Homer is strapped into a chair with mountains of donuts all
% around.  "So, you like donuts, eh?" his keeper queries.  "Uh huh,"
% Homer answers uncertainly.  "Well, have all the donuts in the world!"
% his keeper ripostes, and a metallic machine monstrosity starts
% cramming donuts towards Homer's mouth by fours.  Eagerly he devours
% them.  {Three seconds' worth of shots of Homer eating them are cut in
% syndication.}
%
% Much later, the machine still works overtime, and Homer has become a
% grotesque blob, but his relentless masticatory pace hasn't slowed.
% There are almost no donuts left in the room, and Homer's keeper is
% confused.  "I don't understand it.  James Coco went mad in fifteen
% minutes!"
%
% That night, in the Simpson living room, Homer appears through the
% floor in a cage where the bars are made of fire.  Lionel Hutz walks in
% combing his hair with a fork.

Marge: Homer!  Are you all right?
Homer: [meekly] No.
 Hutz: Mr. Simpson, don't you worry.  I watched Matlock in a bar last
       night.  The sound wasn't on, but I think I got the gist of it.
-- He learns fast, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% A fiery pentagram burns its way into the floor, and up through it the

-- The Grim Reaper speaks, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Lionel Hutz opens the proceedings.

    Hutz: First some ground rules.  Number one, we get bathroom breaks

Blackbeard: Arr!  This chair be high, says I.
-- A tautology, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The devil begins to make his case against Homer.

I hold here a contract between myself and one Homer Simpson pledging me
his soul for a donut -- which I delivered!  And it was scrump-diddley-
umptious!
-- The Satan/Flanders beast, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

Flanders: I simply ask for what is mine!
           [He sits down smugly]
    Hutz: [cocky] That was a right-pretty speech, sir.  But I ask you,
          what is a contract?  Webster's defines it as "an agreement
          under the law which is unbreakable."  [emphasizing] Which is
          unbreakable!

%
% So the Reaper feels he has no choice but to sentence Homer to an
% eternity.  But Marge runs in with a photo of Homer and her at her
% wedding.  It's a picture of Homer choking in an emergency room, and
% Marge explains that Homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself
% before the wedding.  The jury find this roundly amusing.  But she
% hastily tells them, "Read the back!"

Blackbeard: {[looking at the photo] Arr, 'tis some kind of treasure

-- Lame introductions, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The title, "Terror at 5 and a half feet" appears on the screen, and

% wakes up screaming.  Feeling his damp blankets, he says, "I hope this
% is sweat."
%
% He walks into the kitchen for breakfast.

Lisa: Bart, what's wrong?
Bart: [in a monotone] I just had a vision of my own horrible fiery
      death.
Lisa: [expectantly] And?
-- That's it?, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Marge realizes that Bart has had a nightmare, and she tries to
% reassure him.  But an air-horn blast sounding suspiciously like that
% of the transport truck makes Bart scream.  Homer walks in, proudly
% displaying his air-horn and life jackets which he picked out of some
% guy's boat down at the marina.  He blows the horn one more time, and
% Bart's nerves are jarred.
%
% It's a rainy day as Bart and Lisa board the school bus.  Bart is
% surprised to see Principal Skinner sitting on the bus.

Hello, Simpson.  I'm riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys

-- Small mercies, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Bart sits next to Milhouse, rubbing his throat dejectedly.  He glances

% furrows in the side of the bus.  Bart grabs Milhouse.

    Bart: Milhouse...Milhouse, wake up, quick!  Look out the window.
Milhouse: No way, Bart.  If I lean over, I leave myself open to wedgies,
          wet willies, or even the dreaded rear-admiral!
-- Covering his ass, so to speak, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Bart pushes Milhouse out of the way and approaches Otto.  He implores
% Otto to do something about the Gremlin on the side of the bus.  Otto
% glances out and sees Hans driving an AMC Gremlin.  "No problemo, Bart-
% dude, I'll get rid of him," he says, ramming Hans mercilessly.  Hans
% begins to skid out of control, and he whines, "Oh no, I just made my
% last payment."  He drives off the road and stops the vehicle just
% before it hits a tree, but it explodes nonetheless.
%
% Bart's fears still aren't assuaged.  He looks out the window again,
% and sees the gremlin on the back of the bus.  It pulls a metal cap off
% something and begins removing spaghetti-strands of wire from under the
% bus' side-paneling.  Bart yells, "Everybody, there's a monster on the
% side of the bus!"  Everyone screams and runs over to look.

   Jimbo: Hey, there's no monster.
   Ralph: You're deceptive.

   Bart: [desperate] No, no, it's true, there's a monster on the bus!
Skinner: The only monster on this bus is a lack of proper respect for

-- Seymour's adages, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The principal pulls the shade down over the window so Bart won't have
% to worry about it any more.  Bart is still nervous, however, and he
% tries to avoid peeking under the blind.  Eventually, he can resist no
% longer, and he pulls it up.  He screams as Groundskeeper Willy's face

-- Willy, problem-solver, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% Bart is becoming desperate.

    Bart: [with forced happiness] You believe me, don't you?  You're my

% Bart hears a banging on the wheel hub under his feet.  He looks out
% the window and the gremlin jumps out from under the bus.  It reaches
% towards the lug-nuts that hold the wheel on.  Its claws make sparks
% against the metal of the spinning tire, and it manages to remove one
% of the nuts.  After sniffing it disdainfully, it tosses it aside.

 Bart: The gremlin's taking off the wheel.  Stop the bus or we're all

        [Seymour grabs him in a headlock]
Willy: Take me bridle and lash his hands to the seat.

% another lick of his flavor wax, and Bart accepts the offer, cringing.
% Bart suggests that Uter loosen the ropes that bind him, and he gladly
% complies: "Ja, das ist gut."
%
% Bart looks out the window again to see the gremlin continuing to
% remove the nuts from the wheel.  He looks below his seat and sees a
% box of flares, but the four flares have been removed.  Jimbo is the
% culprit this time: he's lit them and put two of them in Martin's
% pants.  Bart goes over and grabs one without Martin noticing, but he
% inadvertently knocks the other one loose.  So he puts it back.
%
% He walks over to the window and pulls the "Emergency Release" lever,
% but the pressure difference between the air inside and outside the bus
% tries to suck Bart and everyone else out of the bus.  He manages to
% keep his grip nonetheless.  He brandishes the flare, and the gremlin
% notices.  Just then, Homer drives by and blares his air-horn, greeting
% Bart with a cheerful "Hey, boy."
%
% The gremlin, sensing its plans are about to be thwarted, tries to
% remove the lug-nuts faster.  Skinner and Willy are trying to pull
% Bart's body back inside the bus.

Skinner: Pull, Willy, pull!
  Willy: I'm doing all the pulling, you blouse-wearing poodle walker!
-- Fitting epithets, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The grown men succeed in pulling our hero back inside the bus.  As
% they do so, Bart drops the lit flare and it bounces down the side of
% the bus.  Fortunately, it hits the gremlin and its body catches on
% fire.  It gapes and loses its grip on the bus, falling off and
% bouncing down the road in a little ball of flame.  Flanders happens to
% be driving behind it and it smacks into his windshield.  Aghast, he
% skids to a halt and runs back to its smoking body.
%
% "Oh dear Lord," he exclaims, looking at its inert form, "it's some
% sort of hideous monster."  He wraps it up in his jacket and holds it
% to him.  An angry claw slashes out, and Ned smiles.  "Aw, isn't that
% cute.  He's trying to claw my eyes out!"  He hugs it.
%
% The bus arrives safely at Springfield Elementary.  Everyone stands
% outside the bus, staring at the tears in the metal made by the

% and it falls out, taking the wheel off with it.  "Gadzooks!"  Bart is

Marge: I _do_ have a life outside this house, you know.
-- Lucrative moonlighting, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

% The family swoop towards Lisa, hissing at her.  But then everyone
% turns to the camera and says, "Happy Hallowe'en, everybody!"  They
% begin to sing "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing" while Milhouse plays a
% miniature grand piano and Santa's Little Helper dances.

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:07]

% The theme music over the end has an "Addams Family" motif throughout,
% and the "Gracie Films" music is different: instead of "Shh!", someone
% screams, and an organ plays the normal music but in a minor key.
