the center of the rainbow's arc, we should be looking either directly
toward or directly away from the sun.  {tkc}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Tony Hill: In my opinion, this was a superb episode.  It had just the
    right combination of comedy and drama.  The mix of Bart and Homer
    was just right too.  The gag with the waiter was superlative.  Homer
    really shined in the hotel.  My only complaint is that we've seen
    too much of Skinner lately.  I give it an A.

Robert Briggs: Great episode!  I give it second best episode of the
    season (after "Deep Space Homer") The gags worked, the story
    worked...I loved the story about the Uncle, and "Meow meow meow
    meow" had me ROFL.  I give it an A-.

John J. Wood: I have to agree with Steve Portugal: the funniest moment
    to me was Homer's "meow meow meow meow" (if it wasn't for that
    moment, the grade would have been D+)", but most of the episode
    appeared to be in cruise control for me (same case as last week's
    disappointment).  Grade: C-.

Joey Berner: Yes!  This is the Simpsons episode I've been waiting for
    for quite a while.  The story was great, some very funny gags and
    great pacing.  [...] I give this one an "A".  Sure haven't seen much
    of Burns lately though....  :(

Matthew Kurth: Anivision does some poor work, but the script was able to
    rise far above it with impressive wit and dialog.  The longer
    opening titles was nice, and the ending held up for a change!  Lisa
    was an absolute treat.  I really liked this one.  Wish it had been
    #100 instead.  Definitely a keeper. 8/10

Dave Hall: I thought it was average.  I didn't see anything that nagged
    me, but I did find the first half of Skinner's Bart hunt to be
    lackluster.  Though, I did smile at Skinner's chewing gum analysis;
    makes me wonder what else he'll put in his mouth (cf. a certain John
    Waters film ;).  Freddy's character was interesting enough for me to
    say I like this episode. 3 out of 5 stars.

Yours Truly: Yep, I _definitely_ like episodes written by John
    Swartzwelder better.  They feel more...unified than some of the
    others.  I've seen quite a few "court" movies lately and enjoyed the
    parody of the legal system.  Good mockery of McBain/"Last Action
    Hero".  I give it a B.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> "This is your fantasy"

Tony Hill writes, "This is almost a copy of a scene from the 1970s `Bob
    Newhart Show.'  Bob fantasized about a date with Emily, in which
    Emily said `there will be no sunrises together until we're married.'
    Bob asked, `isn't that a little conservative, Emily.'  She said,
    `whatever you say, Bob.  This is *your* fantasy.'"

>> Kennedy references

Tony Hill lists the following similarities between the Quimby family and
    the Kennedy family.

    - the compound, which is near water
    - nephew in trouble
    - "Bart-Bart" (cf. John-John)
    - McBain is married to Maria
    - football
    - Boston accent
    - young silent JFK-like figure standing next to Quimby
    - Irish name

Chris Noren adds, "This episode has a nice inside joke for animation
    fans: Freddie Quimby, the spoiled richboy William Kennedy Smith-
    equivalent, is named after the producer of the Tex Avery MGM
    cartoons."

>> Jury members

The jury members that can be identified are: Homer, Principal Skinner,
    Hans Moleman, Ned Flanders, Mrs. Lovejoy, Jasper, Patty, Apu, and
    the man from the Japanese restaurant.

%
% It's another bright, sunny school day in Springfield.  Bart and Lisa
% wait at the door of their house for the bus.

Bart: Oh, how can they imprison kids in school on a beautiful day like
      this?
Lisa: They're not imprisoning us, Bart, they're --
       [a grey bus labeled "Springfield Prison" pulls up]
Bart: [getting on] Prison bus, Otto?
Otto: The regular school bus broke down, so take a seat before I blow
      your heads off!
Lisa: Otto...!
Otto: Oh, sorry.  This bus and I have sort of a "Shining" thing going
      on.
-- Incomprehensible justifications, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% One of the convicted plays the blues on a harmonica while another
% bangs a metal cup against the bars on the window.  Bart groans and
% looks longingly out the window at a nearby stream, imagining he's
% lying on a raft floating down it with a dark-skinned boy.  "Ah," he
% sighs, "this is what being a kid is all about."  Looking up, he
% notices a strange figure on the raft with them, and asks, "Hey Huck,
% what's L-I-N-C-O-N doing here?" to which Huck responds, "I dunno; it's
% your fantasy."  Bart and Abe great each other.
%
% The bus skids to a stop at the school, awakening Bart from his
% reverie.  In the grade four class, everyone groans and moans about the
% new chairs.

    Edna: Well, children, our new ultra-hard PostCherfect chairs have
          arrived.  They've been designed by eminent posturologists to
          eliminate slouching by the year 3000.
  Martin: Mrs. Krabappel?  [groans] I'm having back spasms...
    Edna: [chuckles] I know they seem a little uncomfortable right now,
          but eventually your bones will change shape.
Milhouse: I've lost all feeling in the left side of my body.  [lifts his
          limp left arm with his right arm]
    Edna: Yeah, yeah.
-- Recognizing the signs of danger, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% "Now unfortunately, our school clocks have been running fast all
% semester," she continues, "so today we all have to stay two extra
% hours to make up for the time we lost.  Hah!"  Everyone moans, and
% Bart looks at the clock tampering kit in his desk and regrets using
% it.  He turns to look out the window at the rainbow and sunshine, a
% squirrel gamboling on a nearby branch, when he sees a red sports car
% approach.  Seated next to a delectable blond, its Quimby-esque driver
% laughs, "And to think I got all this after dropping out of the fourth
% grade!"

   Bart: [to himself] That does it, I'm outta here.
          [scribbles something on paper]
         Mrs. Krabappel, I have to go to the dentist.  I have a carroway
         seed caught under my bridgework.  [hands her the note] My Mom's
         number's on there if you want to check up on me.
   Edna: That's OK, Bart.  I trust you.
          [in Skinner's office, Skinner holds a magnifying glass]
Skinner: [reading] "Please excuse my handwriting, I busted whichever
         hand it is I write with.  Signed, Mrs. Simpson."  You were
         right to be suspicious, Edna.  To the crime lab!
-- High-tech elementary schools, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% The results appear on a punch-card, but they're inconclusive.  Skinner
% rues that more students other than Martin didn't agree to have an
% electronic tracking device implanted in their skull.
%
% {Skinner decides to interrogate Lisa.}

  Willy: {Spill it!  Where's your brother?}
Skinner: {You'd better answer him, Lisa.  He's a bad man.
          [Lisa giggles]
         What are you laughing about?}
   Lisa: {You started off as the bad cop, but now you're the good one!
         You and Willy got mixed up about ten minutes ago.}
Skinner: {We did not!  Now where's Bart?  You better tell me!}
  Willy: {Oh, you better tell him, lassie.  I cannot control him when he
         gets like this!}
   Lisa: {[laughs] Now _you're_ the good cop!}
  Willy: {What?!}
-- Not getting their act together, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Bart lies next to the river, a string with a fishing bobble tied to
% his toe, and he sighs, "Ah, the joys of mortgaging your future."  In
% the mist he sees a raft approaching with two men standing on it.  He
% assumes his fantasy has come true, but it's just two homeless men.
% "Hey kid!  You wanna see a dead body?" one asks, and Bart runs off
% screaming.
%
% Principal Skinner has decided to walk around town to see if he can
% find our delinquent young friend.

   Skinner: If I were a truant boy out for a good time, I'd be right
            here: the Springfield Natural History Museum.  [chuckles]
            You're mine, Simpson.
             [Bart argues at a triple-R rated movie box office]
      Bart: Look, if I was under seventeen, I'd be in school, right?
Ticket boy: Yeah, I guess you're right.  Enjoy "Boobarama", sir.
             [Skinner has left the museum, meanwhile]
   Skinner: Why, there are no children here at the four-H club, either!
            Am I so out of touch...?  No, it's the children who are
            wrong.
-- Firm in his conviction, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Bart has decided to bid on some priceless works of art at an auction
% house.  The auctioneer announces, "Sold to the small man with the
% runny nose for 2.3 million."  When Bart giggles and takes off, the
% auctioneer goes back to the man who made the next highest bid of 2.1
% million, but he reacts the same way Bart does.  It transpires that no
% one made a serious bid on the lot.

          [Bart and Homer spot each other suddenly.  They gasp]
    Bart: I can't let Dad see me playing hooky!
   Homer: I can't let the boy see me skipping work!
           [Bart brushes his hair forward; Homer uses a comb as a
          mustache]
    Bart: [walking past] Good afternoon.
   Homer: [walking past] How do you do, sir?
Together: [chuckle] Sucker...
-- Masters of disguise, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Skinner walks along the sidewalk elsewhere and sees a piece of chewed
% gum on the ground.

Skinner: A spoor!
          [reaches down, picks up the gum, licks it]
         His brand of gum, Doublemint.  Trying to double your fun, eh,
         Bart?  Well, I'll double your detention.  {Heh.  I wish someone
         was around to hear that.}
         And so we enter...endgame.
-- Skinner, hot on Bart's trail, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Bart walks out of an ice cream parlor with a giant cone, only to drop
% it when he sees Skinner approaching in the distance.  "Ay caramba!" he
% cries, and runs off, down the street, down a grassy hill, and to a
% rope bridge across a raging river.  He pauses, then runs across it,
% pulling a jagged knife from his pocket and cutting its from its
% moorings.  "Let's see him track me now," he giggles.
%
% But Skinner is relentless.  He walks straight into the quickly flowing
% stream, disappearing briefly underwater, but reemerging from it soon
% enough.  Bart watched from behind a tree.

Bart: Oh my God, he is like some sort of...non...giving up...school guy!
-- Bart is chased by Principal Skinner, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Bart climbs a sheer cliff in an attempt to get away, but Skinner is
% not to be outdone.  Bart seem him making his way inexorably up its
% face, and he hides behind a rock.  Upon reaching the top, Skinner
% stands up and walks towards the rock: "Oh, he's close!  I can taste
% his fear."  He pounces on the rock.
%
% But Bart is nowhere to be found.  Luckily, Freddy Quimby sped by in
% his sports car at just the right moment for Bart to jump in and hide
% under a blanket.

Blonde: Freddy honey?  I think something just dropped into the back
        seat.
Freddy: I'm not paying you to talk.
-- Bart escapes in Freddy Quimby's car, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% The car speeds into the Quimby compound as the gates slam behind it.
% There seems to be a party on the lawn; Freddy crashes through the
% bushes in his car and speeds towards everyone, swerving and skidding
% to a halt just in time.

        [Freddy approaches two people tossing a football]
Freddy: Gimme the ball!
         [runs to the punch bowl, throws it in hard]
        The punch has been spiked!  Ha ha!
Quimby: That's my nephew, displaying the Quimby wit that's won the
        public heart.  Happy birthday, Freddy!  And may all your
        disgraces be private.
-- Witty indeed, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Bart hops out of the car and looks around.  He walks towards a patio
% but is stopped by Diamond Joe.

Quimby: And who are you, little boy?
  Bart: I'm one of your nephews you don't see very often.  Um, Bart-
        Bart.

Freddy: Hey!  What the hell is this?
Waiter: [French accent] It's a bowl of chowder, sir.  ["shaudere"]
Freddy: Wait a minute, come here.  What did you call it?  Say it loud
        enough so everyone can hear.  Cone on, say it...

-- Gotta love those Quimbys, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Bart, who was probably not invited to the table, stands in front of a
% giant Rice Krispie[tm] square (more of a cube) admiring its size.  He
% takes a bite from it -- "Boy, the rich sure know how to live!"  But
% Freddy and the waiter enter and Bart hides under the table, peeking
% out.  Freddy tries to get the waiter to say "chowder" again, but the
% waiter refuses adamantly.  "Never!"  So Freddy responds, "OK, you
% asked for it.  I'm gonna enjoy this!"  As Bart watches, we hear loud
% crashing and snapping. followed by breaking glass.  The waiter falls
% in front of Bart, breaking something in the process.  "Oy, that's
% gotta hurt!" he winces.
%
% Wiggum and a couple of others burst in.  "Oh my God," says the chief

       hope he finally gets what's coming to him.
 Bart: But Freddy Quimby's innocent!
 Lisa: How do you know?  There weren't any witnesses.
 Bart: Heh, oh yeah, right.
 Lisa: You'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party
       like that.
 Bart: Well they didn't, OK?  They didn't.  It says right here in black
       and white, "No witnesses."  Case closed.  [grabs paper] Now let's

-- 37 years of "Good Grief", "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Bart's conscience gets to him on the school bus.

   Bart: Lisa, I gotta tell somebody.  I was at the Quimby compound
         yesterday when that frog waiter got whacked.  I _know_ that
         Freddy Quimby is innocent.
   Lisa: You're a witness?  Bart, you have to tell the police!
   Bart: [groans] I can't.
   Lisa: Why?
Skinner: Bart Simpson, I know you cut school yesterday, and as soon as I
         can prove it, I'm sending you off to the Christian Military
         Reform School.
   Bart: What he said.
   Lisa: Oh, I see.
-- "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

 Lisa: If you testify, Skinner will know you skipped school.  Well, if
       Freddy Quimby didn't do it, I'm sure he'll be found innocent by a
       fair and impartial jury.
        [after school]
Homer: Aw, jury duty?  I'll see that Quimby kid hanged for this!
 Bart: Oh...
 Lisa: {I _knew_ it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail.}
-- Fair and impartial both, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Channel six covers the trial.

Scott: Let's go over to the County Courthouse, live to Kent Brockman.
 Kent: -- ockman, just outside the County Courtroom where an argument
       about chowder has spilled over into the biggest trial in
       Springfield history.  Behind these doors, a federal judge will
       ladle out steaming bowls of rich, creamy justice in a case the
       media have dubbed "Beat-Up Waiter."  This reporter suggested
       "Waitergate", but was howled down at the press club.
       Now, it's illegal to televise court proceedings in this state, so
       [whispers] we'll have to be quiet.
        [walks towards courtroom doors only to have them slammed in his
       face]
-- A sneaky ruse, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Bart sits in the front row looking at the members of the jury.

         [Skinner scowls at Bart from the jury box]
Skinner: [thinking] I know you can read my thoughts, Bart.  Just a
         little reminder: if I found out you cut class, your ass is
         mine.  Yes, you head me.  I _think_ words I would never say.
  Homer: [thinking] I know you can read _my_ thoughts, boy.  [singing]
         Meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow meow
         meow meow meow meow...
-- Not the Meow Mix commercial!, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% The trial begins.  Freddy's lawyer makes his opening statement.

Lawyer: I intend to prove that Freddy Quimby is totally innocent!  First
        of all, his accuser is a very shady character.  That waiter, Mr.
        LaCoste, not only wasn't born in Springfield, he wasn't even
        born in this country!
         [jury gasps, reporters run to phones and dial rapidly]
  Hutz: [to LaCoste] From now on, you tell me _everything_!
-- The key to the defense, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Moe is the first to testify for Freddy.

  Moe: Freddy Quimby was with me the entire...night in question.  We
       were collecting canned goods for the starving people in...er, you
       know, one of them loser countries.
Woman: He's clearly innocent.
        [Chief Wiggum hands him a big bag with "$" on it]
  Moe: Oh good!  My laundry is done.
 Bart: You see, Lisa?  They don't need my testimony.
 Lisa: Only because Mayor Quimby's _buying_ his nephew's freedom.
 Bart: Ah.  The system works.  Just ask Claus von Bulow.
-- No insulin in _this_ trial, however, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Lionel Hutz makes a statement for the jury.

   Hutz: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to prove to you not only that
         Freddy Quimby is guilty, but that he is also innocent of _not_
         being guilty.  I refer you to my expert witness, Dr. Hibbert.
Hibbert: Well, only one in two million people has what we call the "evil
         gene".  [holds up a card showing DNA] Hitler had it, Walt
         Disney had it, and Freddy Quimby has it.  [chuckles]
   Hutz: Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.  I rest my case.
  Judge: You rest your case?
   Hutz: What?  Oh no, I thought that was just a figure of speech.  Case
         closed.  [sits down]
-- Proper legal terms, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Apu notices something amiss on the jury.

  Apu: Excuse me, Your Honor?  I'd like to bring something to the
       court's attention.
        [removes "open eye" glasses from snoring, drooling Homer]
        [judge bangs her gavel]
Homer: [waking up] Hmm?  Huh?  What?!
Judge: Give those glasses to the bailiff.
Homer: [crafty] All right.
        [does so, dons a "half-open eyes" pair]
Judge: And those.
Homer: [moaning] Oh.
-- He should have waited a bit, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

Lawyer: Your Honor, even though I've proven my client's innocence, I'd
        still like to call Freddy Quimby to the stand.  So that we can
        all bask in his gentle decency.
         [Freddy stands up, grins winningly at audience, takes stand]
        Mr. Quimby, did you assault Mr. LaCoste?
Freddy: Of course not.  I love each and every thing on God's green
        earth.
Lawyer: Therefore, you would _never_ lose your temper over something as
        trivial as the pronunciation of "chowder".
Freddy: That's "chowdah"!  Chowdah!  I'll kill you!  I'll kill all of
        you, especially those of you in the jury!
         [man on jury mutters, "He's clearly guilty"]
Lawyer: Wow, that didn't go well.  The defense rests.
-- Making the best of a bad situation, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% The lawyers have called all their witnesses.

       Judge: Will the jury retire and come to its decision?
Mrs. Lovejoy: Heh, this won't take long.  He's clearly guilty.  We'll
              probably be home by dinner time.
      Jasper: Good.  I hear the dog from "Frasier" is going to ride the
              dolphin on "Sea Quest".
-- Gotta rush home, then, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Lisa castigates Bart as the jury leaves.

     Lisa: Well, Bart, because of you, a horrible yet innocent person is
           going to jail.
     Bart: Hmm.  Maybe I should come forward.
  Skinner: I can't wait for the sentencing part!  That's where I really
           shine.
            [Bart imagines standing in front of Skinner at the bench]
  Skinner: Bart, for the heinous crime of "hooky", I sentence you to a
           lifetime of hard labor in the cafeteria.
            [in the cafeteria]
     Bart: [smoking] More cream corn, Jimbo Junior?
Jimbo Jr.: This cream corn tastes like cream crap!
     Bart: Watch the potty-mouth, honey.
            [back to the present]
    Judge: Your sister says you have something to tell me?
     Bart: What?  Uh, um, yeah, uh, I just, I just wanted to say how
           great it is to finally see some chicks on the bench.
    Judge: Hmm.
     Bart: Keep up the good work, toots.  [forced laughter] [runs out]
    Judge: Hmm.
     Lisa: [sheepish] Heh heh, "chicks on the bench".  [forced laughter]
-- A blow for women's lib, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

%
% The jury discuss the case in their private room.

  Jasper: Why bother voting?  He's guilty.
Flanders: Well, we might as well make it official.
   Homer: What does "sequestered" mean?
 Skinner: If the jury is deadlocked they're put up in a hotel together
          so they can't communicate with the outside world.
   Homer: What does "deadlocked" mean?
 Skinner: It's when the jury can't agree on a verdict.
   Homer: Uh huh.  And "if"?
 Skinner: A conjunction meaning "in the event that" or "on condition
          that".
   Homer: So _if_ we don't all vote the same way, we'll be _deadlocked_
          and have to be _sequestered_ in the Springfield Palace Hotel
          --
   Patty: That's not going to happen, Homer.
  Jasper: Let's vote.  My liver is failing.
   Homer: -- where we'll get a free room, free food, free swimming pool,
          free HBO -- Ooh!  "Free Willy"!
 Skinner: Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson.  It has little if
          anything to do with a disobedient whale.  Now let's vote!
   Homer: Uh, how are the rest of you voting?
Everyone: Guilty.
   Homer: OK, fine.  How many S's in "innocent"?
Everyone: Aw.
   Homer: I'm only doing what I think is right.  I believe Freddy Quimby
          should walk out of here a free hotel.
-- You forgot "free shower curtain", "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% So it's off to the hotel they go.  Homer talks to Marge on the phone,
% mounds of food and garbage surrounding him.

  Homer: [on phone] Aw, I miss you too, Marge.  But the law needs me!
         I'll be home as soon as I can.
          [hangs up, presses a button]
         Room service?  Send up two more pot roasts and three more
         pillows with mints on them.
Skinner: {You know...we're kind of like the original "Odd Couple".
         You're the messy one and I'm the --}
  Homer: {Shut up!}
Skinner: {Oh, yes, very well.}
-- Handle with Kare, indeed, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% At home, Bart watches the end of an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon when
% Lisa walks in.

     Lisa: So, Bart, have your insides been gnawed away by guilt yet?
     Bart: Sell it to Hallmark, Sis.  You're looking at Cucumber boy, as
           in "Cool as a".
Announcer: [on TV] Next, on "McGonigle", McGonigle is framed for a crime
           he didn't commit.  And only one person can clear his name: a
           little sissy boy who's too scared to come forward.
McGonigle: You gotta tell 'em what you saw, Billy.
    Billy: But I'm so _scared_, McGonigle.
McGonigle: You gotta do this one for me, Billy: McGonigle.
    Billy: Well, OK.  For you, McGonigle.
    Chief: Well, McGonigle, Billy is dead.  They slit is throat from ear
           to ear.
McGonigle: Hey!  I'm trying to eat lunch here.
-- Negative reinforcement, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Homer watches "Free Willy" at the hotel.

Homer: Jump, Free Willy.  Jump!  Jump with all your might!
        [on the TV, Willy jumps over a rock barrier as a little boy
       smiles, but a shadow looms on his face and the smile turns to
       fear]
Woman: Oh, no.  Willy didn't make it.  And he crushed our boy!
  Man: Ew.  What a mess.
Homer: Ohh, I don't like this new director's cut.
-- Bemoaning those who control things, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% {Later, Homer uses sheets tied together to lower a table out the
% window.}

  Homer: {[lowering a table out the window] Got it, Barn?}
 Barney: {[below] Got what?  [crash] Ow!}
Skinner: {You're stealing a table?}
  Homer: {I'm not stealing it.  Hotels expect you to take a few things.
         It's a souvenir!}
Skinner: {Ah.  Is that my necktie you're wearing?}
  Homer: {Souvenir.}
-- "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Bart is thinking things over at home, and he asks Marge about it as
% she dusts the living room.

 Bart: Mom, what if there's a really bad crummy guy who's going to jail
       but I know he's innocent?
Marge: Well, Bart, your uncle Arthur used to have a saying: "Shoot 'em
       all and let God sort 'em out."  Unfortunately, one day put his
       theory into practice.  It took 75 federal marshalls to bring him
       down.  Now let's never speak of him again.
        [hums as she dusts]
 Bart: Mom.  ...Mom.  ...Mom!
Marge: Huh?
 Bart: What if I can get this guy off the hook?  Should -- should I do
       it?
Marge: Honey, you should listen to your heart, and not the voices in
       your head like a certain uncle did one grey December morn.
        [hums some more]
-- Simpson family skeletons, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% Bart must have said something because the judge decides to reopen the
% trial.

 Judge: Even though reopening a trial at this point is illegal and
        grossly unconstitutional, I just can't say no to kids.
Lawyer: So, young man, if Freddy Quimby _didn't_ inflict these injuries
        on Mr. LaCoste, just who did?
  Bart: Well, I was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened.
         [flashback]
Freddy: Say it, Frenchy!  Say "chowder"!
Waiter: Never!
Freddy: OK, you asked for it.  I'm going to enjoy this!
         [grunts, pops the cork off some champagne, chugs it]
Waiter: Hah.  [slips on floor, bangs head on four frying pans, breaks
        glass, hand lands in blender, then in toaster, then head falls
        in oven, boiling water is spilled on his back, then into broom
        closet where rat traps snap closed all over him, then beaks more
        glass and falls over]
         [back to reality]
  Bart: And that's what really happened.
Waiter: This is an outrage!  I am not a clumsy Clouseau-esque waiter.  I
        will --
         [trips on chair, falls out window into truck containing rat
        traps]
Waiter: At least, there were no big ones -- [snap] -- aie.
-- Only one big one, it seems, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

   Hutz: How could you have seen all this, Bart?  Weren't you supposed
         to be in school?
   Bart: [slowly] I sort of skipped school.
Skinner: I knew it!  I knew you'd slip up sooner or later, Simpson!
    Apu: What slip up?  What are you talking about?  He confessed it!
Skinner: Quiet, I need this.
-- Apu, accidental lawyer, "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% The judge finds Freddy innocent and dismisses the case.  Quimby shakes
% his nephew's hand.

Skinner: Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there.  You testified
         for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in
         a noose.  On the other hand, you skipped school.
   Bart: I guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?
Skinner: [sighs] I'm a small man in some ways, Bart.  A small, petty
         man.  Three months' detention.
   Bart: [groans, {walks away}]
Skinner: {Wait a minute, Bart.  Make that...four months' detention.}
-- "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"

% In their bedroom that night, Homer and Marge lie surrounded by a horde
% of souvenirs from the Springfield Palace Hotel.

Homer: Well, Marge, it was horrible.  Everyone was against me in that
       jury room.  But I stood by the courage of my convictions and I
       prevailed.  And that's why we had chinese food for lunch.
Marge: Good for you, Homey!  You know, a lot of things happened around
       here while you were gone.
Homer: Right, Marge, I wanna hear all about it.  [puts on "open eye"
       glasses] Heh heh --
Marge: Gimme those!
Homer: Aw...[snap]
Marge: And those...
Homer: Aw...[snap]
Marge: And those...
Homer: Aw...
