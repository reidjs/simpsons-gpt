===============================================================================
Halfway past the fourth couch in the couch gag, OFF moves, but the
background doesn't.  {mk}

The police cruisers in the movie seem more modern than those that were
around in 1971.  When did they start using blue lights?  {th}

Being from the San Francisco area, I'll point out the slight problem
with the scenes in "Goodtime Slim, Uncle Doobie, and the Great Frisco
Freakout"; as they go down the first hill, the Golden Gate Bridge is on
their left, so they're headed north/east (toward downtown) and pretty
much in the eastern part of the city (in the west, the bridge towers
would appear to be much closer together), yet in the next shot, the
skyline is behind them (also, the skyline has two buildings with
"pointed" towers; only the Transamerica Pyramid has a non-"flat" top
(not counting Coit Tower, which (a) isn't downtown and (b) has a rounded
top), and I'm not totally sure it had been built by 1971.)  {ddg}

The master bedroom should face the front of the house.  {dh}

The only way it should have been possible to see Bart climb up to the
roof from Homer's bedroom window is if Bart was climbing the side on
which the window is located (so he'd be facing the window, not turned to
the left); Bart is climbing along a nonexistent wall of the house.
{ddg}

When Marge tells Homer they need to talk, the blanket comes to just
under Homer's pecs.  In the next shot, they're partially covered.  {mk}

The titles on the spines of the books are upside down.  {th}

Marge's book-on-tape has a blue package, yet when she hands it to Lisa,
it's green.  {mk}

When Marge gives her "book on tape" to the cashier, it looks like a
"normal" book (that is, the non-"spine" sides are white), but in the
other shots, all of the sides are the same color.  {ddg}

The book the clerk scans which is supposed to be Al Gore's book is
actually the Ueberroth book.  {mk}

The stereo in OFF's car is an 8-Track player, not a compact cassette
player - and there are no controls for the tape player at all!  {mk}

The first bottle Grampa pours turns from yellow to purple.  {av}

Homer tells the kids to take a taxi to Patty & Selma's after the movie;
doesn't he remember what happened the last time somebody tried to send
Maggie there?  Don't Bart and Lisa remember what happened the last time
_they_ went there?  {ddg}

How did Homer & Grampa get permission to set up a table in the mall?
{ddg}

At the mall, somebody hands Grampa two bills for a $1 bottle.  {ddg}

The love tonic disappears from Frink's hand.  {dh}

When Dr. Hibbert is drinking his bottle, it's half-emptied, yet when he
finishes, the bottle's almost full.  {ddg}

Bart couldn't possibly keep that large book in his back pocket.  {dh}

Except for 1F21, the Simpsons don't have a mail slot on their front
door.  {dh}

Barney already knows how to drive a car.  See episodes 7G08, 7F11, 9F14.
{dh}

The tire swing changes heights from one shot to the next.

The oil stain is missing from the driveway in some scenes.  {dh}

A match magically appears in Homer's hand.  {dh}

The other stuff on the bookshelf disappears.  {dh}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Tony Hill: This was a very good episode.  It had two distinct plots.
    Grandpa's "think of me" exhortation was beyond hilarious.  The sound
    of the bat rolling off the roof was very realistic.  My only
    complaint is that they should have made the subplot affect the main
    plot.  GVSI gets an A-.

Sean Curran: Although I've supported the show this season while other
    people have trashed it, I'm afraid that tonight's episode sucked.
    Grandpa, who is usually the highlight of the show, got on my nerves
    tonight.  His stupid lines got boring, and the plot was not too well
    thought out.

Paul M. Payton: If you see the Simpsons as a comedy, you'll score this
    episode low.  If you see it as critic for modern American parent-
    child relations, you may score it higher.  Definitely *NOT* a laugh
    a minute show.  I would probably give it a good solid 'B'.  More
    serious than funny.

Marc Singer: The "Stock Footage Festival" and the Al Gore scene were
    hilarious, and even the "reverse vampires" shtick was good.  But
    best of all was the wholly unexpected plot between Homer and Abe.  A
    nice show.

Gary Meadows: I was very enthusiastic about the she show after the first
    act.  The second act seemed to show a slight loss of direction.  By
    the conclusion, I felt the writers dropped the proverbial ball.  I
    guess I would have liked a fourth act to actually tie up the loose
    ends.  B-.

Don Del Grande: B-minus - it started out as if it had potential, but it
    hit its peak just before they reached the home where Homer grew up
    in.  After that, it went downhill, and that ending landed as hard as
    the end of the log ride at Itchy & Scratchy Land without the pad,
    especially since both the original plot and the "conspiracy" subplot
    remain unfinished.

Carl Frank: First act was tremendous.  It provided equal time for us
    Republican fans of OFF.  And the stock footage festival was great as
    well.  The rest of the plot, however, was tired with few highlights
    or references.  Overall rating: B-.

Scott Fujimoto: The beginning was pretty funny, especially the potshots
    taken at Al Gore.  Plus one memorable line: "Dad, I preferred your
    half-assed under-parenting to your half-assed over-parenting."  I
    hope the next episode doesn't have the half-assed plot under-
    development this one had.  My grade: C-/D+

Matthew Kurth: A neat concept, and some wonderful attempts at
    characterization, but the writers tried to stuff more into 22
    minutes than the show could handle, especially Homer's "half-assed
    over-parenting".  A little shaky, but still pretty good. 7.5/10

Yours truly: A hard episode to pin down.  I like the risque nature of
    treating sex in a TV show, and Abe's huckstering was classic, but
    the Homer/Abe plot seemed thrown in and a bit disjointed.  I'll have
    to give it a C.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis

Don Del Grande explains, "This is a disease caused by getting silicon
    particles in your lungs, and is pretty much limited to underground
    miners."  The Guiness Book of World Records (1995) lists it as the
    longest word in the Oxford English Dictionary.

>> Occam's Razor

Don Del Grande says, "According to Paul Dickson's `The Official Rules',
    the original Occam's Razor (named after William of Occam, who said
    it in the 14th Century, so needless to say this is a translation) is
    `Entities ought not to be multiplied except from necessity'.  This
    has been restated in numerous ways, much as the original Murphy's
    Law has been modified to something simpler, and Lisa's statement is
    a simplification of the original (effectively applying Occam's Razor
    to itself); another version is `When two or more hypotheses serve to
    answer a theory, use the simplest'."

>> Famous people mentioned in this episode

Tony Hill writes, "James Michener is one of America's greatest
    novelists.  He won a Pulitzer Prize for `Tales of the South
    Pacific.'  $1.99/lb. is a good deal indeed!
    
    Robert Mapplethorpe is a controversial gay artist whose works
    spawned major art censorship in the late 80s.
    
    Paul Harvey, said to be one of the 50 wealthiest people in Chicago,
    is a radio newscaster and commentator who was previously referenced
    in `Homer's Barbershop Quartet`, episode 9F21.
    
    Peter Ueberroth went from being head of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic
    Organizing Committee to being commissioner of Major League Baseball.
    (Bob Timmermann adds that Ueberroth "was actually chosen to head up
    an organization called Rebuild LA, which was charged with aiding
    economic redevelopment of Los Angeles after the April 1992 civil
    unrest.  He was widely credited with doing a very poor job of
    this.")
    
    Al Gore, the 45th Vice President of the United States, is author of
    the best-selling `Earth in the Balance,' an environmentalist work.
    
    Dwight Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States, and his wife
    Mamie are probably the most sexless people to have lived in the
    White House in modern times.
    
    Rex Harrison (1908-1990) was a British stage and screen actor.
    
    Paul Anka is a Canadian singer-songwriter.  [He's most famous,
    probably, for writing the theme to `The Tonight Show' - ed]
    
    The Rand Corporation has long been involved in incubating right-wing
    causes.  Score points to MG for annoying more Republicans!"

Marge: You can make a lot of money...

Homer: Ew!  Why are we stopping at this dump?
  Abe: That's the house you grew up in, son.
Homer: Wow.  Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted.
  Abe: Yeah, we lived here 'til the bank foreclosed in '63.  Farm went
       bust after the cows started giving sour milk.  Something must

Homer: Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement?  Maybe I could

Homer: All right, all right.  That's it: we're going home!  I'm sick of

  Abe: If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic 38 years ago, you'd have
       never been born and I'd have been happy.  You were an accident!
Homer: [gasps, stops car] Get out.
  Abe: I'm sorry I said that.
Homer: Out.
  Abe: I'm going to get out of the car, and I hope you'll find it in

Marge: Homey, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of your

Homer: Of course not, Marge, just for the rest of his life.  He said I
       was an accident...he didn't want to have me.
Marge: You didn't want to have Bart.

       your daddy has realized something very important: a father should
       always make his kids feel wanted.  Starting right now I promise

Barney: [walks out from behind a curtain] I used to be a fat, disgusting

       to ride your very first bike.
        [brings out a girl's bike; starts riding it; it breaks]
 Bart: Number one, I know how to ride a bike.

Homer: [pushing her] Whee!  Whee!
 Lisa: Nooo!  Nooo!
 Bart: No offense, Homer, but your half-assed underparenting was a lot
       more fun than your half-assed overparenting.
Homer: But I'm using my whole ass.
 Lisa: Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be...scary.
Homer: [sighs] Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love.  But
       now I've got to go somewhere and do some serious thinking.

% He goes back to the old house where he was born and walks in.  "Here's

% screaming, as fire spreads around the room.

Homer: We're _both_ screw-ups.
