Blackboard:     I DID NOT WIN THE / NOBEL FART PRIZE

Couch:          The couch has been roped off, like at a trendy club.  Some
                trendy people and a mirrored discotheque ball are already on
                the "good" side of the rope.  The family runs up, and a
                bouncer waves in Marge, Maggie, Bart, and Lisa.  Homer is
                denied entry.

==============================================================================
   ... the "smoking" (as opposed to "no smoking") sign in the limousine's
       lavatory?
   ... the gas tank on the family's car was overflowing at Donny's Discount
       Gas?

Don Del Grande:
   ... in the scene where Homer is in the "swimmin' hole", Bart and Lisa have
       "Anivision eyes", despite this being a Rough Draft episode?
   ... Homer planted candy corn?
   ... it never occurred to Marge to sell the mincemeat pies as something to
       get the taste of tomacco out of people's mouths?
   ... since only Homer (and his family) knows the secret of growing tomacco,
       how come he didn't grow more -- or sell the secret to Laramie, now that
       the only crops are gone?
   ... the color of Homer's mincemeat pie?  Is it supposed to be that red?

Ben Fonter:
   ... that you can buy Pork Rinds at the Googolplex for $3.99 and Homer
       didn't buy any, even though he loves Pork Rinds?

Curtis Gibby:
   ... this is the second time this season that "Booty Call" has been
       referenced?  (Yeesh!)
   ... the number on the boat in the Buzz Cola commercial is "107"?
   ... Homer's pretty good with those ketchup bottles?
   ... Homer slapped Gil at the Kwik-e-Mart?  (Woo-hoo, someone had to do it!)
   ... this is the second time we've seen a headstone with Homer's name on it?
   ... one of the farmers wears a John Deere hat?
   ... this episode features both pie and suicide?  (Chris P. will be
       overjoyed.)  [It's an <alt.tv.simpsons> inside joke -- Ed.]

Joe Green:
   ... the Isotopes pennant at Moe's?

Carl Johnson:
   ... Gummi Bears are stored next to tobacco and tomatoes?

Darrel Jones:
   ... the Zorro movie has a speaking taco, according to the closing credits?
   ... the limo's bathroom looked like one you'd find on a commercial jet?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the Kwik-E-Mart now sells gravestones?
   ... the Confederate flag on the Southern Guy's RV?
   ... Maggie pointing at the raccoon that bites Homer?
   ... the family accepts food stamps as payment for Tomacco?  [Well, it
       technically is a food -- Ed.]

Haynes Lee:
   ... tractor wheels spinning backwards due to optical illusion that plagues
       many Hollywood western movies?

Patrick McGovern:
   ... the sheep has bloodshot eyes?

Damian Penny:
   ... Laramie Tobacco is featured, but we don't see Jack Larson?
   ... this episode, with a tobacco-related storyline, aired the same weekend
       "The Insider" opened?
   ... the B-52s parodied their own song?

Frank Reese:
   ... Homer has only one sock on when he undresses for the "swimming hole?"

Tom Rinschler:
   ... Lisa sitting in the front seat of the car when Homer is hiding in the
       Christmas tree?
   ... the Buzz Cola ad on the front of the desk of the country store?

   ... the movie's casting director hired a woman the play the part of the man
       in the iron mask?
   ... the "Fox production logo" music as the audience leaves the theater?
   ... the skeletonized horse or cow in front of the farmhouse?
   ... Homer decided to plant Gummi bears after all?
   ... Homer can do backflips pretty well?
   ... Bart extinguishes the "tomacco" by stepping on it the way you would put
       out a spent cigarette?

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Nate Birch:  This continues the recent tradition, and was one of the
   "wackiest" Simpsons ever.  But again, like in "Guess Who's Coming to
   Criticize Dinner?"  I found the wackiness wasn't that bothersome, probably
   because this episode, actually had a pretty decent as well as original plot
   [...].  This episode was one of the first in a while to have 3 distinct
   acts to it, with act one being by far the funniest with Homer's "Glove
   slap" song.  The second act wasn't really that funny, even though there was
   a lot of jokes, and really they should have been pretty funny, I just
   didn't laugh much.  The third act picked up again though.  This episode was
   also the first in a while to feature the whole family, and not just Homer
   or one or two members of the family.  This episode also featured some of
   the best Simpsons animation in recent history.  Pretty good for a really
   wacky episode.  (B)

Nathan DeHoff:  I might be alone, but I actually enjoyed much of this episode.
   [...] The Zorro movie was hilarious. Homer's sudden glove-slapping
   obsession was weird but amusing, as was the gentlemanly Southerner who
   ended this phase in Homer's life, and provided the basis for the Simpsons'
   move to the farm.  Using Abe's old farm was a good idea, although the
   writers forgot one important detail (see "Goofs").  Once the family
   actually reached the farm, it slowed down a bit, but there were still some
   funny parts.  As far as absurd ideas go, Tomacco was fairly clever,
   although I wish they had done a little more with it (more skewering of the
   tobacco industry, for instance).  A silly episode, but a pretty good one
   within that vein.  (B)

Don Del Grande:  Some of the farming jokes were funny the first time they were
   shown, but the tractor bit bordered on "rake scene".  Also, it took too
   long to get to the "tomacco" storyline, and as a result it didn't last very
   long.  To top everything off, the ending, well, just "ended."  (B)

Nicolas Di Candia:  This isn't an episode which intends to be taken seriously,
   and many segments show it: the various tractor gags, all the Zorro stuff,
   the duel, etc.  The plutonium thing seemed to belong to a Halloween
   special, particularly coming so close after Treehouse of Horror X. I like
   that they remembered many things of early episodes (the farm, the
   Googolplex, etc) and they also remembered to bring back the duel plot at
   the end of the episode.  I also liked the Laramie (sort of) subplot.  All
   this comes to a  (B+)

Curtis Gibby:  Overall, I thought this was a pretty good episode.  It had
   great laughs at the beginning (the movie theater scene), a decent (but not
   fantastic) story, and pretty good characterization.  The only thing that
   grated on me was Homer's Act I dueling, which bordered on Jerk Homer
   behavior.  (I did like his fantasy, "What would Zorro do?")  Also, I think
   they could have come up with a better way to get into the farm story.
   After a great Act I, most of the rest of the episode was what we've come to
   expect from new episodes.  Average.  [...] Act III was more fun than Act
   II, but the Tomacco-crazed animals was a bit of a stretch.  Better than
   last week's "THOH X," this was not among the best episodes ever.  (B+)

Joe Green:  In spite of a surprisingly funny first act, this was overall yet
   another brainless cookie-cutter episode produced under the watchful eye of
   Mike Scully. Judging from the tractor "joke" and the slow pace,
   Maxtone-Graham (whose earlier episodes I liked a lot better) stretched this
   premise about as far as it could go.  (C)

Richard Green:  Holy ---- as Krusty would say, "what the hell was that?"  Even
   the ONE line that made me laugh ("Go get Lassie ... I mean Lisa") got so
   repetitive that I started to scream (HOW many more times were they gonna
   keep showing that same tractor?)  I think those writers need to get the
   point that giving Homer a new job every week does NOT work, and does
   nothing but hurt the show, and Homer as a farmer was almost as boring as
   that SimFarm game that was made a couple of years ago.  The only recourse
   is that this was actually the last of the season 10 holdovers, and
   shouldn't affect any of the upcoming episodes.  (F)

Dan Hogg:  For the first time in memory, I found myself watching this and
   thinking, "Boy, this is really stupid."  Homer's obsession with the
   glove-slapping was unfunny, even the B-52's parody song.  Nothing very
   memorable, except for the tractor running gag and Ralph has his usual funny
   line (even Chief Wiggum was agreeing with him).  Homer was no different
   than before, and there's the typical "something attacks the Simpsons" third
   act.  The idea behind the plot was old-hat, and not very many funny jokes.
   (C-)

Carl Johnson:  AABF19 had the usual recent problems, but was saved by its
   story that was so ... sooo ... PRESENT!  Not to mention the great abundance
   of swell jokes.  Jerkwad Homer and Crazy Animals aside, good show.  (A)

Darrel Jones:  Below average.  As usual, Act One was a riot (the Zorro movie,
   "Glove Slap", Jimmy Carter), but after the Simpsons started farming, it
   went downhill quickly.  The ending was also far zanier than it should have
   been.  A meager 6/10  (C+)

Joe Klemm:  Sorry, but the show went way downhill this episode.  With the
   exception of the Poke of Zorro bit and the Tomacco stuff before the animals
   eat all the crops up, this episode was an utter disappointment.  It would
   have been better handled if Homer got the farm from the Southern guy after
   beating him in a duel, but no, they have to make a "Homer chickening out
   storyline".  Let's hope the rest of the season isn't as bad as this
   episode.  (D)

Ondre Lombard:  If one ignores the fact that this sort of material, and this
   style of doing it has been done more than enough times in the past two
   years, all that can be thought, for me, was there was some very good stuff
   here.  I hated the premise, and I'm not even crazy about how it went along,
   but for some reason, it was funny -- in a "Cape Feare"-"Homer the
   Great"-"Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" sort of way.  My only complaints would
   be the script's tendency to get carried away into very crappy jokes [...]
   and sometimes I disliked the unnatural pacing of things, like Homer sobbing
   with remorse and failure and then milliseconds later thinking up something
   else without any timing to give realism to his actions.  A solid,
   standalone effort.  (B)

Adam Long:  This episode probably had the funniest opening in recent Simpsons
   history, with the Zorro movie, Milk Duds, and (especially) the ending
   credits.  The problem with that is that it got my hopes up that the rest of
   the episode would be as equally hilarious, which it wasn't.  I know that
   sounds unfair, but it did disappoint me.  It was still funny, though (what
   can I say, I liked the tractor gag), and the best episode of the season so
   far IMHO, but compared to our good ol' buddy IMG's classics like "Lisa Gets
   an A" or "Trash of the Titans" I think it may have been lacking a little.
   And the ending ... strange ending.  (B+)

Patrick McGovern:  As blunt a satire as they've ever done.  This was
   good-natured, very funny, but just ... too blunt.  If the message wasn't
   across when Lisa said "If this doesn't prove that Nicotine is addictive,
   what will?", than it was by the "evil" cigarette people.  Still, so many
   parts were ROTFL-funny, and there were lots of freeze frames.  A very good
   ep ... but did I mention that it was too blunt?  (B+)

Abhi Rey:  I want to say that I hate this episode.  The whole premise and its
   execution were just so incredibly stupid.  What is this?  The Simpsons move
   into a farm? Animals attack them after being addicted to their tomacco?
   Puh-LEEZ!  But, this episode was pretty hilarious.  I liked the Zorro
   parody (especially the end credits and the rap song).  The whole bit with
   the southern colonel was priceless, as well as Homer's duel-challenging.
   The part of the episode actually in the farm wasn't quite as funny, but
   there were some great moments, like Homer and Marge's dialogue at the end
   of act 2, and the scene with Ralph and Chief Wiggum.  I laughed a lot
   during this episode, but do to its total lack of taste, it can get no more
   than a  (C)

Tom Rinschler:  Like "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner", this episode
   had me continually laughing.  Sure, the plot was far-fetched, but it not
   only contained a high humor content, but also gave a good amount of screen
   time to each member of OFF.  Only the overdone "tractor tipping" joke fell
   flat.  (A-)

Matt Rose:  Was this a Halloween special?  I've seen FAR more plausible things
   happen in those episodes than this one.  Lessee ... sheep and goats stoned
   on drugs, tobacco flavored tomatoes, radioactive waste being licked and
   chewed on.  What is this?  I've never been so appalled at a Simpsons
   episode ... really.  I can't wait to see what the Maxtone-Graham apologists
   have to say about this one. "duh, homerz so kewl cuz he's WACKY, you're
   just a looser with no life".  It's sad, this show is no longer aimed at
   people with an IQ over 50.  "The Simpsons" today is like a close relative I
   once loved being slowly destroyed by Alzheimer's disease.  No offense to
   anyone who this has actually happened to.  (F)

Jason Rosenbaum:  After last week's pathetically poor episode, I was losing
   faith in this show. Then comes this episode.  This episode was probably the
   best one I've seen since "The Springfield Files."  It started off
   hilariously with the bit with the movie theater and never stopped running.
   Absolutely perfect humor and plot, great middle, and a great ending.  Not
   to mention a hilarious song by the B-52s.  There was NOTHING bad about this
   episode.  Definitely best episode of year.  (A+)

Eric Sansoni:  The AABF series comes to a long-awaited close with an
   all-too-typical entry.  The worst trademarks of the Mike Scully era are
   here: fart jokes, crude bathroom humor, Homer-centrism, wacky new jobs,
   gratuitous past episode references (here it not only distracts but also
   contradicts continuity), illogical plot transitions, weakly integrated
   movie parodies, excessively cartoony displays such as silly gymnastics and
   talking animals, aimless "storytelling," potentially good jokes repeated to
   death, empty "satire," characters who act not ignorant or mischievous but
   flat-out cruel, and little to no laughs.  Mostly decent dialogue, a brisk
   pace, and good use of Lisa redeem the episode somewhat.  (C)

David Shaw:  The best of the new season and the last of the AABF series.  The
   plot had a good point and the glove-slapping thing was hilarious.  The
   movie parodies all good, including the credits.  This proves that
   Ian-Maxtone Graham is the best writer on the staff now.  If only they
   didn't bunch Homer eps together.  I noticed that the Halloween eps had 3
   exec producers.  A new hope?  (A-)

Yours Truly:  One of the funniest episodes in recent memory.  Even more
   important it uses intelligent humor most of the time, instead of the
   cheaper broad humor.  The historically twisted "Zorro" movie almost
   single-handedly makes the show worth watching.  Homer was suitably boorish,
   but not over the top, and Lisa has some good background reaction shots.
   For a one-shot character, the proper colonel who challenges Homer to a duel
   was interesting.  The convoluted plotting may put off some viewers, but the
   show never bogs down, and the writers remembered to provide a proper ending
   this time.  Definitely blue-ribbon material.  (A)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Writer watch

Javier Vera:  Ian Maxtone-Graham has been one of the most criticized writers
   on the series.  He started with "Burn, Baby Burns" which some people
   disliked due to such a bad characterization of Burns and such a big secret
   revealed.  Then he wrote the season 9 premiere "The City of New York vs.
   Homer Simpson" which I personally enjoyed as well as many others, later he
   wrote "The Trouble With Trillions" and "Trash of the Titans", the 200th
   episode, both with mixed reviews.  His first non-Homer episode came next
   season in "Lisa Gets an A", which many people considered Ian's bets
   episode.  It was confirmed in BABF01 that Ian will be with us for season
   11, so let's hope some better work from him, and if you want to know how he
   looks, check the Very Tall Guy from 3F18, which is based on Ian Maxtone-
   Graham.

   [Of course, this glosses over one of the biggest reasons for anti-IMG
   feeling on the <alt.tv.simpsons> newsgroup:  In an interview for an English
   newspaper, he denounced Internet fans as having no life outside the show.
   Some people thought he had a point, others ... well let's just say that
   they took umbrage at the statement.  The whole interview is online at
   <http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/ian.html> -- Ed.]


>> Commercial Serendipity

Tom Rinschler:  I don't know about the rest of the country, but here in
   Cincinnati, Act One was followed by a KFC commercial, featuring an animated
   Colonel Sanders.  I found this highly amusing, it having followed several
   scenes featuring a very similar southern colonel.

   [Other a.t.s. readers reported seeing this commercial, as well -- Ed.]


>> Look out!  It's the Scarlet Lawyer!

Don Del Grande:  After I watched the show, I remembered a rather trivial but
   neverthenonethenevertheless appropriate factoid: when the third in the
   "Blackadder" series (appropriately named "Blackadder the Third") was shown
   by both A&E and later PBS in the USA, they left out one episode - not
   because it was excessively violent or profane or anything, but because it
   included the Scarlet Pimpernel and somebody else had the rights to the use
   of that character on TV.  How did "The Simpsons" get away with it?

   (Maybe the character's more "public domain" now that there's been a stage
   musical made about him?)


Scott Munro:  That *Blackadder* episode is a parody of the novel itself.  *The
   Simpsons* episode isn't.

   I suspect the lawyers for the *BA* distributors were just wimps.  I doubt
   any lawsuit could have succeeded, even had one been files.


Mr. Cydonia:  Just thought you'd like to know that the Black Adder/Scarlet
   Pimpernel legal troubles were apparently solved recently, 'cause I saw that
   episode on my local PBS station a few weeks ago.


>> Is there anything that mule can't do?

Joe Klemm:  Gus, the mule referred in the closing credits of the Poke of
   Zorro, refers to a 1970's film.  It's about a football team who recruits a
   mule and his trainer as players on the team.  The reason: every time the
   owner says "Oyavidge" or something like that, the mule would kick a field
   goal or extra point.


Todd Emerson:  Not to be confused with "Gladys, the Groovy Mule."


>> Hi, I'm John Byner.  You might remember me from such movies as ...

Haynes Lee:  Canadian fans may know John Byner as the host of comedy variety
   show "Bizarre."  Married With Children fans may know John Byner as the gold
   prospector who looks like John Byner.


Dean Humphries:  "Bizarre" was on TV in the states also during the late
   eighties.  I have noticed that for some reason the writers on the Simpsons
   seem to use him has a star of many of the movies they advertise on the
   show.


Todd Emerson:  I actually remember John Byner as the voice of the ant in those
   "The Ant & the Aardvark" cartoons, as well as the voice of Gurgi (sp?) in
   "The Black Cauldron" (but I'm trying to forget that one), not to mention
   several appearances on "The Carol Burnett Show."


>> Lyrics to the soundtrack

Courtesy Otto Exec:

   From the "Z" to the "O" to the double "R" "O",
   He's the dude in the mask from the barrio.
   With his horse and his mask and his big old sword,
   He'll cut your butt from a '52 Ford.


Yeah, yeah, we know what you're asking.  Mr. Exec answers:  No, I don't get
   the final line of the "soundtrack" either.  I'm only repeating what the
   closed captioning reported.


>> The Field of Honor

Jeff Cross:  Dueling was a form of combat with rules used to honorably settle
   grievances between people up to the mid-1800s, as opposed to the no-holds-
   barred gutter fighting you see in schoolyards, outside bars, and on "WWF
   Smackdown."  Challenge would be made by swatting someone in the face with a
   glove or gauntlet, then throwing it onto the ground in front of the
   challenged; picking it up would denote acceptance. The challenged got to
   choose the type of weapon used for the duel, usually swords or guns.  Each
   duelist brought along a second to watch his back, and the duel was held at
   daybreak to avoid the police.  The term "demanding satisfaction" meant that
   blood needed to be drawn to consider the matter settled.  Pistol dueling
   involved marching a distance, turning, then opening fire; in Europe this
   meant one exchange and then it was over, but in America shooting would
   continue until somebody was hit.  The only good thing that dueling actually
   accomplished was holding the United States together: during the War of
   1812, New England was going to secede if Aaron Burr could bring New York
   State in on the deal, but it fell through when he killed Alexander Hamilton
   in a duel.


>> This old house

Javier Vera:  If Grandpa's house was burned 5 years ago, how come it's
   restored now?  I mean, if anyone restored it somehow, how did the house got
   so old in such a short time?  Of course writers remembered the house, yet
   they forgot what happened to it at the end of the episode.


>> Sneed's Feed and Seed

There's a joke hidden in the name of this store, or so says Jeff McClellan:
   Notice how the last 3 letters of each word are all "eed" modeled after
   Sneed, well put Chuck in place of Sneed and replace "uck" as the last 3
   letters of each and it makes "Chuck's F--- and Suck" [Which is apparently
   in circulation on playgrounds throughout America -- Ed.].  I thought it was
   rather clever of them.


>> So *that's* what guys at the office talk about when football season's over.

A poster known only as "GBR" wondered:  what was the deal with that one scene
   where Lenny walks one way and Karl goes the other?  Anyone know?


"Admiral Bones" thought:  Stop me if I'm wrong, but I thought it was a parody
   of office small talk. You know, how people just say something completely
   meaningless to make conversation and go on.  Well a talk about outgoing
   mail must qualify.


Seth Miller:  And it was by a water cooler!  That's humor, people!


Adam Long:  I figured it was making fun of big-shot "guy-talk."  Like in "When
   You Dish Upon A Star," when Moe is talking about buying cotton balls and
   Carl says "The absorbent kind?" and Moe says "You got that right!" and they
   all give each other high-fives and cheers.


"Quinten":  I was thinking it was more an attempt on Karl & Lenny's part to
   hide the fact that they were shipping radioactive material out of the
   plant.  They were trying to be "sly" about it,  you know,  just send some
   outgoing mail, nothing special.


>> It was good, but it was no "Grasshoppersaurus"

Joe Klemm:  For those who don't watch Sci-Fi, AMC, or "Mystery Science Theater
   3000," the Amazing Colossal Man is a film by cheesy filmmaker Bert I.
   Gordon.  The plot involves a man who, while trying to rescue the people on
   a crashed airplane, is exposed to radiation from a nuclear bomb test.
   However, instead of killing him, the blast causes the man to grow bigger
   everyday, and he eventually goes on a rampage in Las Vegas.


>> The Tractor Gag -- Funny repetition or repetitive rake scene?

A fair number of people felt there were too many scenes where Homer was pinned
   by the tractor.  Adam Long speaks up for this series of jokes:  I thought
   the tractor gag was well done because it was something new each time.
   First he's riding it and it falls, good ol' clumsy Homer.  Second, he walks
   off, not even ON the tractor and still manages to have it fall on him. The
   third time the corn hits it and knocks it over, not even his fault (that
   must have been one hell of a throw though), and the fourth time he doesn't
   even bother to get up to get his picture taken, and even gives a "thumbs
   up." Definitely not a "rake scene" (which I also happen to think is
   hilarious, BTW).


>> Car Watch Down on the Farm

Benjamin Robinson:  The tobacco executives ride in a Ford Aerostar that has
   been converted into stretch-limo duty.  (There actually was a company that
   made limos based on minivans, instead of the usual Lincolns and Cadillacs.)
   The Aerostar hasn't been made for a few years now, so that limo has been on
   the road for awhile.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Dried Smoked Tomatoes


The *other* Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Soylent Green Acres


Ondre Lombard suggests:  Little House in Springfield


Bill McNeal and Chris Palm noticed a shot of Homer tapping his pitchfork on
   the ground in time with the "Green Acres" theme appeared in the commercials
   for this episode.  It was cut from the actual show, however.


Mike Erickson:  Groening said once he would never have Homer slap, hit or
   strike Bart in any way ... and Homer stopped himself for doing so in this
   episode.


Benjamin Robinson:  Chad Everett is an actor.  I remember him from "Medical
   Center," a 70s medical drama that aired in syndication when I was growing
   up.


Kelly Robinson:  How'd they get the B-52s to do an episode?


Chris Palm:  More importantly, how'd they get the B-52's to do an episode
   without advertising "The B-52's guest star on this Sunday's Simpsons!" on
   every commercial?

% more fertilizer.  "I'm only one man, Marge," Homer answers.  The 
% farm next door is growing corn as high as an elephant's eye -- 
% literally.  The farmer razzes Homer a little, and then tosses him an 
% ear of corn as a peace gesture.  It sails over Homer and falls on 
% the tractor, which in turns falls over on Homer.
%
% At least the family isn't starving.  That night's dinner features 
% the fruits of their labor.

Marge:	More tumbleweed, Lisa?
Lisa:	No thankth.  I'm thtill finithing my thithleth.
Bart:	Dad, if we leave for town right now, we can still catch 
	the dinner special at Krustyburger.
Homer:	Sorry boy, going back to Springfield would be a coward's 
	way out.
Bart:	Wasn't skipping town in the first place a coward's way 
	out?
Homer:	Oh, you're right!  I'm a coward.  I made such a mess of 
	things!  If only there was some magic potion that would 
	make those crops grow.  [brightens] Wait a minute.
	[gets up and cranks the handle on the phone.  At the power 
	plant, Lenny answers]
Lenny:	Plutonium?  Gee, Homer, isn't that kind of risky?  [pause] 
	Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's not.
-- A plan is hatched, "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% Lenny dutifully ships the plutonium, making small talk with Carl in 
% the process.  When Homer gets it, here carefully opens the vial and 
% test-tastes a little.  The rest, he loads into a pesticide sprayer.

Time to give Mother Nature a little goose.
-- Homer Simpson, "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% Homer and Marge stand on the farmhouse porch, surveying the glowing 
% fields.

Homer:	Well Marge, have you ever seen a field glow like that?
Marge:	It's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?
Homer:	Of course not.  But you know something?  Sometimes you 
	have to break the rules to free your heart.
Marge:	You got that from a movie poster.
Homer:	Well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in 
	hope.
Marge:	Where'd you get that?
Homer:	From the producers of, "Waiting to Exhale."
-- What, not "The Poke of Zorro?"  "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% Marge notices plutonium on her husband's gums.  "Shut up and kiss 
% me," Homer says.  Before she can answer, Homer kisses her.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:03]
%
% A rooster's crow awakens Homer that morning.

Homer:	Wake up, honey.  It's time to harvest our radioactive 
	supercrops.
Marge:	But it's only been one night.
Homer:	That's all it takes.  If we learned one thing from "The 
	Amazing Colossal Man" and "Grasshopperus," it's that 
	radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast.
Marge:	But didn't Grasshopperus kill Chad Everett?
Homer:	Only because he tried to reason with him.
Marge:	Oh.
-- "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% Family stands at the door, ready go to out and see what bold new 
% supercrops have been unleashed by the power of the atom.

Homer:	Brace yourselves, everybody.  You're about to see the 
	hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables 
	man has ever known.  You might want to crane your necks 
	upward now to save time.
	[the family looks up, and then walks outside]
	Ta-da!
	[but there is nothing to see up there but sky.  On the 
	ground, the fields are as empty as the day before.  A 
	tumbleweed rolls by]
	All right now, don't panic.  It's possible the giant 
	vegetables are invisible.  [feels around for them]  Oh, 
	where are you?
Marge:	Oh, honey, give it up.
Homer:	Aw, you're right, this farm's hopeless.  Why didn't I 
	listen to those inbred hicks?  I guess I'll just go hang 
	myself in the barn.
Marge:	Homer, no!
Bart:	Let him go, Mom.
Lisa:	Wait, Dad.  You don't have to kill yourself.
Homer:	This better be good.
Lisa:	[brushes ground, revealing a small plant] Something is 
	growing.
Homer:	[gasps] A sprout!  And there's some more!
Marge:	What is it?  Carrots?  Peas?  [gasps] Maybe it's okra!
Homer:	Who cares what it is?  It's growing.  I've saved the farm!  
	Yay ... oh!  [falls forward, and squishes two of the 
	plants with his knees]
-- "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% A montage of farm pictures -- Maggie standing next to sprouts, Lisa 
% standing next to young tomato plants, Bart standing next to bigger 
% plants and making a face, and Homer pointing to fully-grown plants 
% while pinned under the tractor -- is shown while the theme from 
% "Green Acres" plays.  It took more than a day, but the Simpson farm 
% now boasts a bumper crop of tomatoes.  Homer dreams about the types 
% of ketchup his tomatoes will become.
%
% Bart eats one, and promptly spits it out.

Bart:	Bleh!  Tastes like cigarette butts.
Marge:	[takes the half-eaten "tomato"]  That's odd.  The outside 
	looks like a tomato, but the inside is brown.
Lisa:	Maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.
Homer:	Oh, great, I've got a field full of mutants.
Bart:	Gimmie.  I want more.  [grabs back the tomato and eats it]
Lisa:	I thought you said it tasted terrible.
Bart:	It does.  [grinds out the remains of the first tomato] But 
	it's smooth and mild.  [grabs another] And refreshingly 
	addictive.
Homer:	Addictive, eh?
-- The seeds of trouble, "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% Soon, Homer has set up a roadside vegetable stand, complete with a 
% sign that reads, "ToMacco."

Lisa:	Tomacco?  That's pretty clever, Dad.  I mean, for a 
	product that's evil and deadly.
Homer:	Aw, thanks honey.
Marge:	Well, I'm not crazy about the plutonium or nicotine, but 
	it is very nice to see Bart eating his vegetables.
	[cut to a shot of Bart eating a bushel basket of tomacco]
	[Chief Wiggum drives up and gets out of the car with 
	Ralph]
Wiggum:	Excuse me?  Mr. Farmer Man?  I promised my son he could 
	tip over his first cow, and I -- [notices sign] tomacco?
Homer:	Yes, it's the latest craze.  Try some, won't you?  [offers 
	a free sample]
Wiggum:	Go ahead, Ralphie.  The stranger is offering you a treat.
Ralph:	[takes a bite of a tomacco, but spits it out] Oh, Daddy, 
	this tastes like grandma.
Wiggum:	[takes a bite, and likewise spits] Holy Moses, it *does* 
	taste like grandma!
Ralph:	I want more.
Wiggum:	Yeah, me too.  We'll take a bushel or a pack or just -- 
	just give it to me.  [takes a bushel basket of tomacco 
	from Homer, and gives him a wad of cash]
Homer:	[giggles evilly]
Marge:	Can I interest you in a mincemeat pie?  They're very --
Wiggum:	Does it have tomacco in it?
Marge:	No.  But I use only the --
Wiggum:	Thanks.  [walks off]
-- "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% The fledgling tomacco business flourishes.  A long line of people 
% waits in front of Homer's tomacco stand.  (Marge has a tougher time 
% raising interest in her mincemeat pies.)
%
% The Simpsons' success does not go unnoticed.  A limousine stops in 
% front of their farm, and a man offers the family a ride.  They 
% accept.

Exec:	Meet the Laramie cigarette team.  This is Mindy, J. P., 
	and Emil.
Mindy:	Homer, we're in a bit of a pickle.  Kids are crazy about 
	tobacco, but the politicians won't let us sell it to them.
Homer:	Those dirty, rotten --
Mindy:	Tell me about it.  But there's no law against selling kids 
	tomacco.  That little "m" is worth a lot of money to us -- 
	and to you.
Homer:	How much?
Exec:	Well, let's say a hundred ...
Homer:	[gasps]
Exec:	... and fifty ...
Homer:	[gasps louder]
Exec:	... million dollars.
Homer:	[excited] One hundred and ... [calmly] May I speak to my 
	family for a moment?
	[the Simpsons crowd into the limousine's small bathroom]
	Did you see the Emil's looking at Mindy?  I think 
	something's going on there.
Marge:	Shouldn't we be talking about the $150 million offer?
Homer:	Oh yeah, let's take it.
Lisa:	Dad, it's a tobacco company.  They make billions off the 
	suffering and death of others.
Bart:	She's right, Dad.  They can afford a lot more.
Lisa:	No --
Marge:	I'm with Lisa.  Let's take them to the cleaners.
-- Lisa Simpson, master negotiator, "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% Homer announces to the tobacco executives that he won't accept 
% anything less than 150 *billion* dollars.  The executives respond by 
% dumping him on the road beside his house.  Homer isn't discouraged 
% by the apparent setback.  After all, they have the world's supply of 
% tomacco safe on their farm.
%
% Or maybe not.  Animals from neighboring farms have also discovered 
% the refreshingly addicting taste of tomacco, and have trampled down 
% the Simpsons' fence to get it.  Homer chases them off, but there's  
% only one plant left.  A cow rips it out of the ground and she and 
% Homer play tug-of-war for it.  Homer has to distract her and carries 
% the plant back to the house.

Homer:	[soothing, to the plant] There, there.  We had quite a 
	scare today, but you're going to make us millions.  Yes 
	you are.
Lisa:	You're about to launch a terrible evil on the world.  
	You've got to destroy this plant.
Homer:	I know, honey, but what can I do as an individual.  I 
	wouldn't know where to begin.
Lisa:	Just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
Homer:	I wish I could make a difference, Lisa, but I'm just one 
	man.
Lisa:	[growls]
Homer:	I agree, but how?
-- "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% The debate is interrupted when the barnyard animals, desperate for a 
% fix, crash through the windows of the house.  The family tries to 
% block the windows, but a bull and an elephant smash through the 
% walls.  The family is surrounded.  Marge implores Homer to give the 
% plant to the animals.  He's reluctant at first, but changes his mind 
% when an ostrich tries to peck him.  He tosses the plant up for 
% grabs, and it's grabbed by Mindy, the Laramie executive.

Mindy:	Well, what a lovely gift.  Gotta run!  [runs into a 
	waiting helicopter]
Homer:	So, Mindy!  How did you want to pay me the 150 million?
	[she closes the helicopter door in Homer's face]
	Cash will be okay.
	[the helicopter takes off]
	Or stock?  Does your company have stock?  Mindy!
	[to his family, who have walked up to join Homer]  Mindy 
	and I are just hammering out a payment plan.  [to the 
	fleeing helicopter] We'll talk Monday!
-- Homer Simpson, novice negotiator, "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)"

% Aboard the chopper, the executives rejoice in their victory.  The 
% pilot mentions that they seem to be carrying a little too much 
% weight.  Suddenly a crazed sheep pops up from behind the seat, and 
% attacks the executives.  The helicopter flies out of control and 
% crashes with a ball of flame into the side of a mountain.  The sheep 
% bounds away from the crash site.
%
% With no more crops, there's no more reason to stay down on the farm.  
% So, the family drives back to Springfield.  Homer wonders why he 
% left.  The persistent colonel camped out on his lawn quickly reminds 
% him.
%
% The moment of truth has finally arrived.  Homer and the colonel, 
% each armed with a pistol, start to duel on the front lawn.

Colonel:	[pacing] Five, six, seven, eight, I say, eight, 
		nine, and ... ten.  [sniffs the air] What is that 
		intoxicating aroma.  Could that, I say, could that 
		be mincemeat pie?
Marge:		It certainly is.  Why don't you put down your gun 
		and have a slice?
Colonel:	Oh, don't mind if I do?
Homer:		Hey, are we dueling or what?
Colonel:	Oh, where are my manners?  [shoots Homer in the arm]
Homer:		[cries out in pain]
Lisa:		[holding a pie] Are you okay, Dad?
Homer:		I think so.  The bone stopped the bullet.
Lisa:		Dad, this might be one of those things you should go 
		to the hospital for.
Homer:		After pie.  [eats a slice]
