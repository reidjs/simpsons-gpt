Couch:          Wearing "Tarzan"-style jungle costumes, the family swings into
                the living room on vines.  They land on the couch, with Maggie
                landing on Marge's lap.  Homer swings past the couch and
                crashes offscreen.

Don Del Grande:
   ... the blackboard quote was appropriate for the episode?
   ... the scene of Homer having one eye much larger than the other that were
       in the commercials were not in the show?
   ... the eye store was called "Eye Caramba", not (the incorrect) "Eye
       Carumba"?

       more than his finger count?

   ... "Vitamin Barn" has its own postcards?
   ... there are no Starbucks in the mall?
   ... when Sherri/Terri gets dimples, she looks like Moe?
   ... Lisa didn't realize at first that even if the shoes were in the "off"
       position, they started dancing by themselves?

*  Shouldn't Lisa already be familiar with (and maybe even disdainful of) the
   "plain girl becomes pretty girl" movie cliché?  [Maybe not.  See "Comments"

=  Milhouse wasn't wearing shoes when he started running from the tiger, but
   had them while he was running.  {ddg}

-  The Leftorium is first to the right of "Prints", but then it's to the right
   of "Beauty Supply".  {ddg}

-  The Leftorium is usually on the second floor, but in some shots, it is on
   the first floor.  {js}

*  Frink gave Lisa only one shoe controller, yet both her shoes respond to
   ambient sound.  {bjr}

*  Somehow, the automatic shoes knew the choreography of the routine.  {ddg}

*  Okay, Frink invented automatic dancing shoes.  Even if we accept that,
   though, wouldn't they only affect Lisa's FEET?  They wouldn't allow her to
   do full-body moves like that slide, and it wouldn't really have been THAT
   hard to stop dancing: just sit down.  I guess Lisa didn't have time to
   think of that.  {nd}

*  Lisa's shoes kept going even after everybody had stopped clapping and the
   theater was pretty much empty.  {ddg}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Wilson Banswell:  After a season of (mostly) crap, this was, err less crap.  I
   loved Ralph as a tap prodigy, the shoes not being on, etc, it was all
   great!  I loved the stupid, but not insane, screaming "Jerkass Homer!".  I
   don't remember a good episode this year with as less Homer as this.  And I
   also liked Lisa as an average eight year old.  I mean come on people she
   hasn't quite been acting like one the last few seasons!  And the tango
   movie was superb!  I'm still laughing after seeing the Hispanic Milhouse.
   The one thing I disliked was the mountain tiger sequence, but besides that,
   everything thing else was good.  (A)

Nate Birch:  I wasn't looking forward to this episode much, what with
   Swatzwelder's bad showing last week, and Julie Thacker's previously crappy
   episode, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  This episode actually
   had a cohesive plot, which included the first decent subplot we've seen in
   a while, as well as characters that actually behaved like real people.  The
   episode was very funny as well, with some great gags we've never seen
   before (tons of great Millhouse stuff).  On top of that this episode made
   better use of the cast than usual, as a number of characters that we
   haven't seen much of lately god major parts (Wiggum and Frink).  Finally
   there wasn't even much jerkass Homer or annoying wackiness, damn good
   episode!  (A)

Nathan DeHoff:  Overall, I thought this was pretty good, as far as recent
   episodes go.  Aside from the automatic shoe thing, the tap-dance plot was
   developed well, and the subplot with Bart and Milhouse in the mall provided
   some good gags.  All three media parodies ("Tango del Muerte,"
   Cyborganizer, and the Little Vicky movie with the dancing cat) were quite
   amusing.  I definitely could have done without Homer's eyes crusting over,
   though, and, thanks to the commercials, I saw this unpleasant bit
   approximately five times during the night.  I'd say this episode is worth a
   (B-)

Curtis Gibby:  Kudos to Julie Thacker for crafting an episode that had me
   laughing out loud a number of times.  The writing was original, and most of
   the show was a delight to watch.  The "Looney Tunes" lion scene in the mall
   was pretty lame, but other than that, I would rate "Last Tap Dance in
   Springfield" as very good.  (A-)

Joe Green:  Better than "Kill the Alligator and Run", but that's not saying
   much.  Despite some funny bits (specifically, Wiggum evoking Wile E.
   Coyote), this episode consisted of three totally different subplots, only
   one of which went anywhere.  (C-)

K. Hideky:  I too thought this episode was hi-larious.  It had some of the best
   situation jokes and one liners of the season.  "I think my biggest mistake
   was to go for the cheese."  "You are now carrying my child."  "But how is
   this possible?"  "It is just one of the mysteries of the Tango de la
   Muerte!"  Since I base the rating of this comedy cartoon by how much it
   made me laugh, I give it an A+.  Excellent all around except not enough
   done with Homer's laser eye surgery ... but perhaps it's for the best.  How
   many times can we replay the old James Bond and the laser gag?  (A+)

Carl Johnson:  Julie Thacker presents a nice bundle of well-phrased satire in
   this sitcom's obligatory dance episode, but unfortunately, the story
   structure is severely lacking, and the first act is downright gruesome.
   Still some pretty good scenes involving Chief Wiggum and John Frink, and a
   nicely executed third act.  (C)

Darrel Jones:  About par for the course for Season Eleven, but that's a good
   thing.  This time, the best gags included the "retooling" of the
   Cyborganizer and the scenes with Bart and Milhouse in the mall.  As always,
   Ralph was good for a few laughs.  And the Little Vicki movie, along with
   the "old Broadway-style" ending and closing credits, were excellent.  (B)

Andrew Levine:  Like "They Saved Lisa's Brain" and "Hello Gutter, Hello
   Fadder," BABF17 is a lousy episode disguised as a neo-classic, using the
   formula of giving ATSers what they keep saying they want (more Lisa, less
   Jerkass Homer, Baby Gerald, etc.) to hide the fact that the writing is lazy
   and the script is a schizophrenic hydra spliced together by committee
   writers.  Vicki is inconsistent and unlikable and the plot follows the road
   most traveled by. "Tap Dance" reminded me of that old Alaska Airlines
   commercial where cheerful stewardesses on a competitor's airline serve
   hungry passengers a measly bag of peanuts surrounded by plastic garnish.
   Bon appetit, my fellow Lisa lovers.  (C-)

Michael Nusair:  Wow.  After what was definitely the worst episode of the
   season, and probably ever, comes the best (of the season, *not* ever).
   Almost all of the jokes worked for me.  While at first I thought Homer's
   whole 'eye-crusting' thing was stupid,  I thought the punchline was pretty
   funny (Kearny tricking Homer into buying him Booze and Cigarettes). Also,
   the foreign movie was pretty good ("I think your father is watching you
   right now"), and of course, so was Professor Frink. Overall, not a classic,
   but a very solid episode - especially compared to last week's crap-o-rama.
   (A)

Matt Rose:  An incredibly refreshing and surprising episode.  No overhyped
   appearances by lousy flash-in-the-pan pop singers, no jockey-elf trolls, no
   mysterious plot twists, no stupid Homercentric antics.  A sweet ending that
   didn't leave you scratching your head.  Good one-liners.  EXCELLENT
   characterization of Lisa; good with the rest of the family.  Lots of
   Professor Frink (still perhaps the funniest minor supporting character).
   The whole bit with the shoes was a bit strange and wacky, but it was a lot
   more convincing than most of the far-fetched stuff we've seen this year.
   Last week I was convinced the Simpsons were dead with no chance for
   revival.  It might not be the case if the writers would produce more
   episodes like this.  A real diamond in the rough that really felt good to
   watch after three mostly unwatchable seasons.  (A)

Eric Sansoni:  One of the funniest episodes of the season, this also restores
   some humanity to the increasingly all-too-cartoonish cartoon family.  The
   eye-crusting "sight gag" is the only indicator of recent excesses.  Lisa's
   desire to dance is convincingly developed, and provides the center of
   realism needed to bounce good jokes off of.  There are many, including a
   great parody of dance films and their "sexual energy," good moments with
   Chief Wiggum, Ralph, and Frink, and a hilarious bit with a cat from old
   kiddie films.  Miss Vicky is one of the most intriguing satirical
   characters in a while, and provides at least one classic line.  The ending,
   too, in the way it kids the cliches usually found in a story like this, is
   in fine Simpsons form.  (B+)

Jessy Scholl:  What in the world was that carnage that flew across the screen
   tonight? Ok, so it wasn't that bad, but I seriously think that the main
   plot, with Lisa dancing, was weak.  The things that I found funny with this
   episode was Homer getting Laser Eye surgery after trying on 46 odd pairs of
   glasses, and then running Dolph and his friends around town.  I also liked
   the Bart plot in which he and Millhouse spend a week in the Mall. (This
   should be the main plot.)  The only thing that I like about Lisa tap
   dancing was the last scene where she steals the show.  Mike, here is some
   advice.  This episode would have made a good movie.  (C-)

Fox Wolf:  Good by means of humor, but in the wackiness department ... well,
   you know. Self-Tapping shoes?  That was a little ... off.  Well, Professor
   Frink, who knows what he can do, but I can't really let it slide that way.
   So, the final grade suffers for that.  But anyway, I liked the first act,
   just not Homer's eyes crusting over.  The subplot was good, and revealed
   even more stupidity of Chief Wiggum's.  The main plot was good, and had
   some very good Ralph lines in it, too.  But I really can't let the shoes
   just pass by.  [It's gotta be the shoes! -- Ed.]  (B)

Yours Truly:  I'd call this episode "ever so average" if that didn't sound
   ever so ridiculous.  Both major plots -- Lisa is inspired to take dancing
   lessons, which don't work out, while Bart and Milhouse "camp" at the mall
   -- are solid.  Some of the jokes, like the one with the mountain lion, are
   great.  Too many of the rest are flat, though, as if the writers didn't
   bother to look past the most obvious humor idea.  We've also seen the
   archetype of the overly-demanding teacher before.  "Last Tap Dance" isn't
   bad, but lacks the zing to be the terrific episode I was hoping it would
   be.  (C+)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B+ (3.32)   Std Dev.: 0.8373   (27 reviews computed)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Meta-reference corner

Someone known only as "tw9jd5" observes:  When part is laying down on the
   floor at the mall and begins his countdown to his tantrum, he holds his
   hand open and starts with 5, then 4, 3 etc.  Bart and everybody else only
   have 4 fingers per hand.  If he had gotten down to 1, he would not have any
   fingers left.  A little odd I thought.


>> Musical Reference

Joe Green:  Professor Frink quotes Carl Douglas' "Kung Fu Fighting" while
   backstage with Lisa.


>> "My gosh, she's beautiful"

Jojo Macross writes:  I do agree that the way she got into it [dancing] was
   contrived, though. Smart, perceptive Lisa taken in by a stupid B-movie.


Seth Miller responds:  I knew someone was gonna bitch about this so I was
   prepared to swoop in with a response immediately.  You can't have it both
   ways, either she is going to explain a joke (there's no cane in "Citizen
   Kane") or she is going to miss it (else she would have said "this is so
   trite, we all know she's going to turn out to be beautiful".)  If you'd
   prefer, they can write her out of the series so her perceptiveness won't
   ruin jokes and her occasional gullibility won't be out of character.


Jojo Macross, again:  No, I don't prefer that they write her out of the
   series.  But surely there can be a different setup to her getting into
   dancing than like this.  For someone who is unfamiliar to the show, this is
   funny, but for someone who has seen Lisa criticize so many similar movies
   and situations ... it's not as funny.


Jesus Zimman:  Lisa's character is deeper than that.  She's extremely
   intelligent, yes, but she's also an 8 year old girl and she's affected by
   the fantasy of being swept off her feet like most young girls are.  She
   wants to be intelligent and beautiful and have someone appreciate her for
   all of that but thinks it will never happen because one has to be a buxom
   idiot to "snag a man."  This gives her hope otherwise.

   Even the most intellectual of us are sometimes susceptible to
   socialization; especially intelligent children.


Jeremey Vitrano:  Agreed.  I think that it is not out of character for an 8-
   year- old girl to get caught up in fantasy every now and then and be a
   little dreamy.  She was much more like this in the early episodes.  Back
   then, she was just a smart little girl rather than a smart little girl who
   points out everything that's wrong.


Heather Garvey adds a personal note:  I was a smart, saxophone-playing girl as
   a child, too.  That doesn't mean we can't appreciate learning something
   new, or get excited over seeing someone else do something new and
   beautiful.  Hell, I still wish I could figure-skate like a pro.  And I
   *did* go out for lessons once and did about as badly as Lisa did.  (Ow!
   Shin splints!)  Does that mean I suddenly turned into a gullible sucker
   because Paul Wylie skating to "Carmina Burana" inspired me to give it a
   try?  Don't think so.


>> On the spaceship lollipop ...

Benjamin Robinson:  Lisa's dance teacher, "Lil'" Vicky Valentine, was based on
   the real- life child actress Shirley Temple.  Ms. Temple was to the 30s
   what the Olsen twins were to the 90s -- a cute little moppet with broad
   audience appeal -- except Temple had much greater critical acclaim. Her
   movies were mainly just excuses for her to look adorable and show off her
   talent for song-and-dance numbers.  The upbeat fare was just what the
   doctor ordered for Depression-era audiences who needed a break from the
   bread lines, and Temple became a huge star.  Her career faded out at about
   the time the Depression did.  By then, she was growing into a teenager (and
   even had a screen kiss), which is kind of a career-limiting move when
   you're a child star.  Ms. Temple did better for herself than Vicki
   Valentine, though.  A friend from her Hollywood days, President Ronald
   Reagan, named her ambassador to the UN.  This brings up another interesting
   parallel.  Ms. Valentine takes a quick time-out to rail against the
   Communists.  Since Shirley Temple (now named Shirley Temple-Black) was
   appointed by the decidedly anti- Communist Reagan, it's safe to assume she
   had the same "better dead than Red" philosophy.


Tom Restivo adds:  [At the time this episode originally aired] Shirley just
   celebrated her 72nd birthday.  If Miss Vicky is about the same age, it's a
   credit to her stamina (any Real Life dancers who were still hoofing at 70-
   plus?)

   Shirley and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson danced together in "The Littlest
   Rebel", "The Littlest Colonel" (both 1935), and "Rebecca of Sunnybrook
   Farm" (1938).  They became the first interracial dancing team in cinema
   history.


>> Val Kilmer, ¡Si!  Yoko Ono, ¡No!

Benjamin Robinson explains:  Val Kilmer is an actor who (among other things)
   starred as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's "The Doors."  Homer apparently
   has the impression he was an actual band member.

   Yoko Ono was John Lennon's second wife (and Sean Lennon's mother). Her
   persona was very similar to Barney's girlfriend's in "Homer's Barbershop
   Quartet (9F21)."  John liked to bring her around to Beatles' recording
   sessions, and her presence there tended to disrupt the band.  Today, many
   Beatles fans blame her for instigating or at least accelerating the group's
   breakup.  In the aftermath, she and John formed the Plastic Ono Band.  It's
   kind of funny that Homer blames her for that band's demise, as well.


>> Yeah, but what I want is "Blair Witch" parody repellant

Joe Klemm tells us why Blair Witch repellant is a handy thing to have:  The
   Blair Witch Project is a low budget horror film that was big at Sundance
   and the summer movie race last year.  Recorded on a video camera and a
   black and white DAT camera, the film is about three filmmakers who are
   making a documentary about the Blair Witch, a mythical being living in
   Maryland. Unfortunately, they get lost in the woods and eventually
   disappear, very likely the Blair Witch's latest victims.  Thus, the footage
   they shot while in the woods shows the last days of the filmmakers before
   their disappearance.  Buying Blair Witch repellant for Bart is a wise idea,
   considering that many of the Blair Witch incidents, according to the
   legend, involved children, including one where a 1940's hermit was told by
   the Blair Witch to kill some children in a strange fashion (killing one kid
   while having another stand in the corner), which explains the shot of one
   of the filmmakers standing in the corner at the end of the film.


>> Morg synthesizers

Carl Johnson writes about the inspirations for the name:  When Bart and
   Milhouse first enter the mall, they mention how lucky they are not to have
   to listen to cheesy camp songs.  The irony here is that the pass a music
   store wherein a man is singing a cheesy camp song.  But notice the keyboard
   the man is playing.  It reads "Morg".  Morg is not a real keyboard company.
   If you're relatively familiar with synthesizers, you probably know that
   there is a company called "Korg", which is one of the most popular brands
   out there.  But the "M" in this Springfieldian company is most likely
   derived from Bob Moog, considered by many to be the inventor of the
   synthesizer.  (Don Buchla might also get that credit, but his synthesizer
   wasn't marketable.) Moog's company, R. A. Moog, Inc., and later, Moog
   Music, produced some of the first marketable synths.  Moog Music eventually
   went the way of the early personal computer companies, and was never as
   successful as large companies such as Yamaha and Korg.  I'm surprised the
   writers know of this Mr. Moog, as nobody I know has heard of him, and I
   didn't hear of him until I read a book about synthesizers which could only
   be obtained through Amazon.com because none of the bookstores around here
   carried it.  I think Moog is one of those men who will be lost in history,
   and I'm glad the Simpsons were able to reference this man's fine work
   before it dissolved into the sludge of history.


Daniel McConnell adds:  I've known about Bob Moog for years, and so have many
   of my musician colleagues - I don't think he's nearly as obscure as you
   portray him.  Many bands used Moogs and mini-Moogs, and some still do (e.g.
   Beck, Radiohead(?), Rush, maybe Flaming Lips).


>> If they had two holidays, they could have two sales

Benjamin Robinson explains:  Presidents' Day was created when Congress decided
   that giving both Washington's *and* Lincoln's birthdays off was one holiday
   too many.  It falls on a Monday in mid-to-late February. Presidents' Day is
   most often used as an excuse for store sales, which explains why the mall's
   manager was reluctant to close.


>> Mall Walkers

Benjamin Robinson:  "Mall walking" has become a popular exercise program for
   America's senior citizens.  Malls present an ideal environment for a low-
   impact walking program:  They're air-conditioned, free of automobile
   traffic, (relatively) free of street crime, and are on nice level ground.
   Some mall owners have even taken the step of opening the mall early, before
   the stores open and shoppers arrive, so the mall walkers can wander around
   without getting jostled by crowds.


>> Read my lips

Benjamin Robinson notes:  I noticed in the first act (and possibly the other
   two as well) that, while they were talking, the characters' mouths made
   that "stressed smile" expression.  The particular smile I'm talking about
   can be seen clearly in "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt) (AABF19)," when Marge
   finishes saying, "And I'll repress the rage I'm feeling."  In this episode,
   it shows up, fleetingly, when the character said something with an "m" in
   it.


>> Fun with promotions

Benjamin Robinson:  Fox USA's promotion of this show was even more off-kilter
   than usual. It made it appear that Homer's eye surgery was the focus of the
   story, rather than just a first-act diversion.  Lisa's plot wasn't even
   mentioned.  To top it off, two of the scenes weren't in the final product:
   a Bart-and-Milhouse reaction shot (making that Three Stooges "we're in
   trouble" sound), and a shot of Homer with a grossly inflamed eyeball.  I
   think the second shot was lifted from a different episode, "Lard of the
   Dance (5F20)."  Sheesh, whatever happened to truth in advertising?


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Andrew Levine alterna-title for this show is:  This is Spiteful Tap


Don Del Grande:  If Turner ever gets the rights to this episode, will the
   ending be colorized?


Benjamin Robinson:  As anyone who watched "Married ... With Children" knows,
   tap is the nerdiest form of dance.  Seems fitting that Lisa would get
   sucked into it, albeit slightly against her will.


Jessy Scholl:  In Bart and Millhouse's case, I feel that the Exit that
   Springfield mall was putting in is a new main exit with a high ceiling.

% Milhouse if he can see the lion.  Milhouse parts the bushes and sees the
% lion's angry face.  Milhouse is rendered speechless and is only able to
% communicate with Bart through pantomime.
%
% They run from the bushes to a hall labeled "Exit".  Once they get there,
% they see it's the name of a store that is coming soon.  Cornered by the lion
% in the dead end hallway, Bart goes for the long shot: throwing a ball of
% yarn from a bin at the lion.  The lion pounces ... on the yarn, and plays
% with it like a cat.  Milhouse declares Bart a genius, but then is jumped on
% by the lion.  Bart quickly throws another ball of yarn, again distracting
% the lion.

Bart:     You okay, Milhouse?
Milhouse: Nothing that a handfill of Gummi Bears can't fix.  [laughs]
          [they walk down the hall, revealing Milhouse's badly scratched
          back]
-- The boys outsmart the lion, "Last Tap Dance in Springfield"

% The lion returns to the general area of the cops.  It has a piece of yarn
% hanging from its mouth.

Lou:    Well, well.  Looks like the cat got the rat.
Wiggum: And that's the end of that ... "tail". [brushes hands off]
Eddie:  Uh, Chief, should we try and get the mountain lion back in its crate?
Wiggum: I repeat: [brushes hands off]
-- Story line concluded ... or is it?  Yes, it is, 
   "Last Tap Dance in Springfield"

% It's almost time for the dance recital.

Vicki: Okay, everyone, we need big smiles out there, so line up for dimpling.
       Now this may hurt a lot.  What am I saying, "may"? [uses a nail
       gun-like machine to make dimples in Sherri's/Terri's cheeks] Now,
       that's a happy face.
Lisa:  [runs on stage] Little Vicki!  I figured out how to dance!  I can be in
       the show now!
Vicki: I'm sorry, Lisa.  People go to a children's dance recital expecting a
       certain level of professionalism.
Lisa:  But-- but you don't understand....
Ralph: [doubled up on the floor] I ate too much plastic candy!
Vicki: Heavens to Betsy!  The star of the show is sick!  Whatever will we do?
       There's only one person who can get us out of this pickle ... Lisa?
Lisa:  Yes?
Vicki: Help me into Ralph's costume.
Lisa:  [sigh]

% It's time for the children's tap dance performance.  The dancers prepare on
% the stage while the curtain is closed.

Vicki: Show time, children.  Let's go! [to Lisa] Okay, curtain puller, this is
       your moment to shine.  Oh, it's too important; I'll do it for you.
       [opens the curtain]
Lisa:  [groan]
-- "Last Tap Dance in Springfield"

% The dance recital begins.  Little Vicki, Allison, Janey, and a girl come out
% of the spaceship dressed as astronauts to greet Sherri, Terri, and a girl
% dressed as green Martians.

Vicki:   Lean, muscular children of Mars, we bring you candy.
         [the astronauts present oversized plastic candy]
         [the Martians giggle]
Allison: Let's walk over to them.
Vicki:   Why walk when you can dance?
         [other astronauts nod]
-- Perfect segue to a dance sequence, "Last Tap Dance in Springfield"

% Piano music starts and the astronauts start tap dancing.  The Martians join
% them and form a line.  Homer and Marge watch from the audience.

Marge:   Where's Lisa?
Homer:   Shh!  This plot is hard enough to follow as it is.
Dancers: [singing] On the Spaceship Lollipop, gingerbread men like to do hip
         hop, and chocolate chips....
         [Lisa's shoes activate and she dances on-stage and joins the line]
         ...We can start to dance on Mars, where everything's green....
Marge:   Oh, there she is.  Hi, honey! [waves; Lisa waves back] Wow, look at
         her go!
Homer:   Yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off.
-- Just before the trouble starts, "Last Tap Dance in Springfield"

% In the dance, Little Vicki starts what is intended to be a solo dance.
% Lisa's automatic tap shoes, however, force her to copy Vicki's every move.

Vicki: What are you doing?
Lisa:  I can't help it!   It's the shoes!
Vicki: Nobody upstages Little Vicki! [hiss!]
-- "Last Tap Dance in Springfield"

% They continue to dance synchronized for a while.  Lisa begs Vicki to stop
% dancing, who takes it as a challenge.  They each do a handspring directly
% into a split.  Vicki slides and stands; Lisa slides through her legs and
% stands, causing uproarious applause.  The clapping causes Lisa's shoes to
% move randomly.  She does a back flip off the wall, and more clapping ensues.
% To make matters worse, Homer prods the audience to an ovation of the
% standing kind.  Lisa's shoes begin to spark and smoke as she continues to
% dance ramblingly.  Professor Frink tells the audience to stop, to no avail.
% Lisa gradually makes her way down to the seating.  They finally stop
% clapping when they all flee except for Homer and Marge.

Marge: Lisa's gone berserk!  Do something, Homer!  Do something!
       [as Lisa comes closer, Homer sticks out his foot, tripping her]
Lisa:  [on the ground, legs still moving] Oh, thanks, Dad.
Homer: I didn't think, I ... just acted.
-- The horror ends for now, "Last Tap Dance in Springfield"

% Later, Little Vicki, Lisa, Homer, Marge, and Professor Frink talk in the
% otherwise empty auditorium.  Vicki holds up the short-circuiting shoes.

Vicki: Self-tapping shoes?  I'm ever so pissed!
Lisa:  I'm sorry, Vicki.  I just wanted to be a dancer *so* badly.
Vicki: [sigh] I understand.  We all do crazy things when we're desperate.  I
       once destroyed Buddy Ebson's credit rating.
Lisa:  Why?
Vicki: He knows why.
       [Homer and Marge look at each other]
Frink: [looking at shoes] Jesus, Mary and glavin!  These shoes are in the off
       position!
Lisa:  You mean I danced all by myself?
Marge: See, honey?  All you needed was to believe--
Homer: [taking the shoes] What are you talking about, Professor Frink?
       They're clearly in the on position.  See?  "On".
Frink: I was merely trying to spare he girl's feelings, you insensitive clod.
Homer: Oh -- OH!  Well, now that I look even closer--
Lisa:  Forget it, Dad.  Oh, I guess I'm never gonna be your Broadway baby.
Homer: That's not true, honey. [they all start to walk] You can always write a
       depressing Broadway play of some kind.
Lisa:  You think so?
Marge: Sure, it could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
Homer: Hey, yeah!  You could load it up with lots of swears!  That's what
       David Mamet does.
Lisa:  Oh, I love you guys.
-- "Last Tap Dance in Springfield"

% They come across that ball and weasel.

Frink: Uh-oh!  It's out of its matrix!  Nobody move!
Homer: Why, it's just a cute little weasel.  Hello there, Mr. Weasel. [reaches
       for weasel]
       [The screen goes black and "The End" is written.  We hear zapping and
       Homer screaming.]
       I'm down!
-- "Last Tap Dance in Springfield"

% [End of Act Three.  Time:  20:17]
%
% Closing credits done in the style of an old movie.  The Grace Logo sound
% is Little Vicki reciting, "Tappa-tappa-tappa."  Meanwhile, the lower
% third of the screen shows the clip of the cat rubbing its eyes in
% disbelief.
