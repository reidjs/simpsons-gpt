> Opening Sequence
=======================================================================

>> COUCH SCENE

      A Brady Bunch-esque opening with OFF, the pets, and Grampa,
      and the couch in the middle.  They all run to it.

	(Recycled from 3F01.)

=======================================================================
> Did you notice...
=======================================================================
   ... Hans Moleman at the front of the tryout line?
   ... one of the pictures at the historical society is a silhouette
       with a Marge-like bouffant?

Ricardo A. Lafaurie Jr.:
   ... the girl with the big red hair (who grabs my fancy) sitting
       to Jimbo's left in the film presentation?
   ... Hurlbut's mustache wiggling when Lisa confronts him?

Dale G. Abersold:
   ... in "Young Jebediah Springfield," Troy McClure seems very young?
   ... Mrs. Krabappel is not a Springfield native?
   ... Kearney is at least 20 years old?
   ... Lisa's class has only 20 pupils?
   ... as town crier, Homer is actually pretty damn good?
   ... Jebediah wrote down "Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!"
   ... Lisa is an unconvincing liar?
   ... Marge's family is not native to Springfield?
   ... Adlai Stevenson is buried in Springfield?
   ... while talking to the George Washington of 1781, Lisa addressed
       him correctly as "General Washington"?
   ... in the parade, Marge is dressed as a comely lass (of virtue
       true)?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... the watery sound of the film's music?
   ... the hand on the buffalo -- excuse me, land cow -- as Jebediah
       tries to subdue it?
   ... the boom microphone interlopes on the frame for a few seconds?
   ... Hans Sprungfeld/Jebidiah Springfield bothers to write down his
       laughter ("ha ha ha ha")?
   ... the loops at the base of the prosthetic tongue attach over the
       molars?
   ... even though Lisa got with the program, Quimby's sniper tries to
       take her out?

Oliver Dueck:
   ... that Ralph Wiggum actually got an A on his essay?
   ... the bullet hole in the stage after Lisa left?

Mark Richey:
   ... Troy McClure doesn't remind us of previous educational
       biographies he's been in?
   ... Kearney's older than I am (I was born on 1/17/77)?
   ... Homer knows what an apprentice is (and wants to be one anyway?)
   ... that the Jubilee Committee is made up of Dr. Hibbert, Rev.
       Lovejoy, Mayor Quimby, Chief Wiggum, and Principal Skinner?
   ... Lisa knows who Chester A. Arthur is, while Hurlbut doesn't?
   ... Ralph gets an "A" on his Jeb paper?
   ... Homer knows which key will open the case?
   ... the comic book guy has written a screenplay?
   ... Apu is cleaning the spot where Lisa tried to put the flyer up?
   ... Adlai Stevenson is buried in Springfield?
   ... Wiggum shows an awful lot of disrespect to Jeb's skull?
   ... the Washington painting at the Historical Society is the exact 
       same size as the original?
   ... the guy scratching his head during Lisa's speech?
   ... the Chinese float?
   ... the sharpshooter tries to kill Lisa anyway (and misses)?
   ... Homer jumps out in front of the Flanders?
   ... Mrs. Lovejoy protests Homer?

John Murray:
   ... when Troy is shown ridding the "wild" buffalo you can see some
       one pushing it?
   ... the comic store guy wrote a movie about computers, and personal
       liberty?
   ... the sponsors from Long John Silver, refuse to sponsor a pirate?
   ... the Chinese Dragon in the parade?

Jason Hancock:
   ... Kearney is old enough to shave?
   ... Springfield's state flag has a red, a white, and a blue stripe?
   ... Ralph gets an "A" on his paper even though he asked if he could use
       illustrations?
   ... Homer calls Lisa the "littlest _guy_ I know?"

Don Del Grande:
   ... Miss Hoover and Mrs. Krabappel smoke left-handed?
   ... Kearney uses a Norelco three-head rotary razor?
   ... Lisa isn't wearing a bicycle helmet when she rides to the
       Historical Center?
   ... nobody ever bothers to look in the fife in the decades since
       the message was put there, despite the fact that the fife is a
       hollow tube and anything inside it would have been rather
       conspicuous?
   ... when Lisa first discovers the confession, the back of it appears
       to be part of the George Washington painting?
   ... Hollis Hurlbut mentions that Jebediah is easily as great as
       William Dawes, who rode with Paul Revere to warn of the British
       invasion (and made it farther than Revere)?
   ... Lisa takes Jebediah's confession at face value?
   ... no historians ever noted that Jebediah spoke with a speech
       impediment, yet he had a silver tongue?  (There are some sounds
       that cannot be made with a "solid" tongue)
   ... apparently, nobody through history ever saw Springfield's silver
       tongue shine, or if they did, they never mentioned it?
   ... when Homer opens the case, he gets the correct key from the ring
       on his first attempt?
   ... Homer shows butt cleavage when he opens the case?
   ... Lisa asks that some of her leaflets be done in goldenrod, which
       is a lot closer to gold than yellow, yet they're all yellow?
   ... in Lisa's dream, George Washington doesn't wear shows, but
       Jebediah Springfield does?
   ... Grampa's uniform has three chevrons (stripes) of different
       colors, but they should all be the same color - yellow?
   ... Maggie only appears for about one second in this episode, when
       Lisa is making her speech at the parade?

Sarah Trombley:
   ... that the antiquarian, Hollis Hurlbut, is obviously named after
       two of the Harvard Yard dorms?

Rick Senger:
   ... Homer's hat size is larger than Ned's?
   ... Lisa takes the same hat size as Jebediah Springfield?
   ... Moe's bar has a cigarette machine by the door?  [This is usually
       hideously illegal, but... --ed]
   ... Jebediah Springfield's coffin was _purple_?
   ... Jebediah Springfield is responsible for the famous portrait of
       George Washington being incomplete?

Justin Paluska:
   ... when Lisa went into the historical society, she introduced
       herself as MRS. Simpson, as if she was married, instead of Miss
       or Ms. Simpson?

Damian Penny:
   ... Herman is in the crowd during the parade?  (I guess he never
       went to jail for the counterfeit-jeans ring after all.)

Frederic Briere:
   ... Lisa doesn't care about Homer (or anybody else) getting infected
       by the fife?
   ... Lisa doesn't look in Jebediah's shoes after all?
   ... when opening the coffin, everyone gasps for absolutely nothing?
   ... there's no mention of Jebediah's previous feats, such as his
       famous bare-handed fight with a bear?

>> Goofs from Class Film {mar}

    - The settlers came across the buffalo in a wooded area.  The
      buffalo were almost entirely out on the Great Plains, which had a
      noticable lack of trees.

    - It's quite obvious that Troy isn't really riding the bucking
      buffalo.  The stunt double in long shots is clean shaven, and in
      the close ups, we can see a hand shaking it.

    - When Jeb rides the buffalo back to the other settlers, it's quite
      obvious he's being pushed on a stuffed buffalo.  When the camera
      pulls back right after they stop, you can see the two guys that
      had pushed it striaghtening themselves up.  

    - Right before Jeb's big speech, a boom mike drifts into view.

= The state flag here doesn't match the state flag shown in 7F01.
  (with "NOT JUST ANOTHER STATE")

- The three corner hat starts to rip before Homer puts it on for the
  first time.  {mar}

+ When Lisa reads Jeb's confession, there are a couple of sentences
  after the Ha's.  However, when the paper is layed out by Hurlbuck,
  the ha's are at the very end.  {mar}

+ Wouldn't the comic book store guy have a copier at his own place?
  {mar}

- Simpsons are having breakfast but the clock says one o'clock?  {hl}

* How did Quimby get out of his chair so quickly to silence Homer?
  {jh}

= Lisa's coonskin hat disappears between Act I and Act II.

+ Lisa claims there's no mention of Jebediah Springfield in history
  prior to 1795, yet in 9F18 there's "evidence" he (supposedly) fought
  in the Battle of Ticonderoga in 1775.  {ddg}

+ A real historian would never throw away a document (as Mr. Hurlbut
  does), since even forgeries have great historical value.  {dga}

* When Sprungfeld attacks Washington, the flag that's brought in has
  a white stripe on top and at least 17 stripes.  {ddg}

* The flag in Miss Hoover's classroom has 25 stars and 15 stripes.
  {ddg}

* Why shouldn't Jebediah care about Springfield?  Regardless of his
  former name, didn't he found the town and create the word "embiggen"?
  {fb}

= The buttons on Moe's phone are arranged four across, and three down,
  rather than the usual three across and four down.  {bjr}

+ Groundskeeper Willie says that he is too superstitious to work in a
  cemetery in 2F16.  {hl}

+ I'm pretty sure that there's no eternal flame at Adlai Stevenson's
  grave.  {mar}

* There is not enough smoke when Jebediah's coffin is opened to allow
  anybody to see the tongue, stare at it, and then pick it up.  {fb}

= After the reaction shot at the open coffin, Willie disappears until
  he reburies Jebediah  {mar}

+ When everyone is laughing at Ralph, Lisa's desk isn't seen.  {mar}

+ The city would not take back Homer's bell and hat, since they belong
  to Ned Flanders.

= When Hurlbut throws away the confession, he crumples it up, but when
  Lisa takes it out of the trash can, it's not crumpled, just rolled?
  {mar}

= When Lisa runs out of the crowd, Smithers is wearing a cap and Burns
  isn't, but when Lisa gives her speech, Burns has the cap instead.
  {ddg}

+ Lisa could have devised a better way of backing out of her speech at
  the parade; if nothing else, she could have publicly recanted her
  earlier story.  {bjr}

+ In the first shot of the parade, there are no barricades, but after
  Lisa's speech, they suddenly appear (including in front of Lunchlady
  Doris, and the Flanders, who didn't have one the first time we saw
  them).  {mar}

+ Lisa ignores all of the good things Jebediah Springfield actually
  did; in 8F01, it never bothered her that Thomas Jefferson was a
  slaveholder when she went to his memorial for "advice".  {ddg}

= When the Chinese float passes, the crowd on the other side of the
  street is completely motionless.  {mar}

= The bullet hits the platform long after the gunshot is heard.  {ddg}

=======================================================================
> Comments and other observations
=======================================================================

>> Y'ello, I'm Donald J. Sutherland

One of Sutherland's roles that is pretty much talked about a lot in
    this newsgroup is his role in "The Day of the Locust" as a
    character named... Homer Simpson!  Pretty strange choice.

>> Body Exhumation (or, What _is_ that awful SMELL?!)

Dale G. Abersold says "From time to time, the bodies of historical
    figures are exhumed by historians.  I tend to believe this occurs
    not to prove any hypothesis, but to bring publicity to the
    historian, an otherwise unglamorous profession.  The most famous
    recent exhumation was that of American president Zachary Taylor,
    to determine whether or not he was assassinated.  The conclusion?
    Inconclusive!"

>> Chester A. Arthritis -- Catch It!

Benjamin Robinson says, "Chester A. Arthur became President when a
    disappointed job-seeker shot James Garfield in the 1880's.  That
    incident led to his most noteworthy achievement:  the civil service
    exam, which (theoretically) gave government jobs to the best-
    qualified applicants, rather than to the best suck-up.  President
    Arthur is also known for really funky facial hair.  He had a really
    distinctive sideburn-and-mustache combination not seen before, or
    since, his tenure in office."

>> Historical Fakery (or, Make a Fortune by Changing the Past)

Benjamin Robinson says, "This episode mentions two famous forgeries.

    "Howard Hughes was a famous reclusive billionaire.  (Think of Monty
    Burns in `$pringfield (1F08)' and you get an idea of what he was
    like.)  After his death, some guy claimed to have a will entitling
    him to the Hughes fortune.  Supposedly, the man saw Hughes
    hitchhiking -- this would have to be before Hughes wigged out
    completely -- and gave him a lift.  Hughes was so grateful that he
    included the man in his will.  Howard Hughes was crazy, but nobody
    believed he was THAT crazy, and a court determined the will was
    fake.

    "The Hitler diaries were a big thing among historians, since no
    genuine Hitler journal existed at the time.  As it turns out, no
    genuine diary exists at this time, either; it was a clever forgery.
    Chemical analysis showed that the ink (or the paper, I forgot
    which) didn't exist until several years after Hitler's demise.

    "So far as I know, no one had the audacity to foist an
    `Emancipation Retraction' (presumably a retraction of Lincoln's
    Emancipation Proclamation) upon the historical community.
    
>> One Guy Who Didn't Like Ike

Benjamin Robinson says, "Adlai Stevenson was a well-respected Democrat
    who had the unfortunate task of running against one of World War
    II's most popular generals:  Dwight "Ike" Eisenhower.  Stevenson
    was trounced, although he is one of the least obscure losing
    Presidential candidates."

Jason Hancock gives us a description that looks right out of Encyclo-
    pedia Britannica ;-): "Adlai Stevenson II (1900-1965) was governor
    of Illinois in the early 1950s and ran for President as a Democrat
    in 1952 and 1956, losing to Dwight Eisenhower both times.  He was
    also the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 1960 until his
    death.  Stevenson came from a strong political family.  His
    grandfather was Vice President under Grover Cleveland's second term
    and his son, Adlai Stevenson III, was a former U.S. Senator who ran
    for governor of Illinois twice in the 1980s but failed both times."

>> The Mysterious Disappearing Family

Benjamin Robinson says, "A number of episodes feature nearly non-
    existent roles for Marge, Lisa, or Maggie.  In "Lisa the
    Iconoclast," it's Bart's turn to be a bit player in his own show.
    He had precisely three lines:

   - Well, I hope they show the time where they traded guns to the
     Indians for corn, and then the Indians shot them, and took the
     corn.

   - Well yeah, dad, you're a big fat loudmouth and you can walk when
     you have to.

   - "I want to help you, George Washington," -- pfff -- even your
     dreams are square.

    "Bart also shows up on the "Community Spirit" float at the end of
    the story, but that's it.  Well, at least he got more screen time
    than Maggie; she didn't appear at all until the parade!"

>> What's an "Iconoclast"?

Mark Richey ponders, "I'm sure I'm not the only one who had no idea
    what an iconoclast was when they first saw the title (and if I am,
    don't I feel stupid?)  According to the Dictionary of the English
    Language, an iconoclast is "one who attacks and seeks to overthrow
    traditional or popular ideas on institutions."  Jim Smith, aka 
    "Epigram Man" has an iconoclast page on his homepage.  However,
    I prefer Brain's definition: "a defiant radical who marches to
    the beat of his own drum".  How's that for classiness?

>> Where is Springfield? (As if.)

Mark Richey says, "Now I'm really confused.  We know it's not in
    Maryland.  The 1796 founding date would seem to put it somewhere
    between the Appalachian Mountains and the Louisiana territory,
    probably in the Kentucky/Ohio/Indiana region.  However, as far as I
    know, they didn't have buffalo that far east.  Once again, it could
    be anywhere."

Jason Hancock adds, "If Springfield was founded in 1796, it would have
    to be in a state east of the Mississippi since the western states
    were under foreign rule at the time.  Much of the West (from the
    Rockies to the Mississippi) was given to the U.S. in the Louisiana
    Purchase of 1803."

>> Mystery solved, now we can look at Washington in his glory

Mark Richey says, "I've been racking my brain all night, and I can't
    remember for the life of me who painted that portrait of
    Washington.  However, I'm pretty sure it wasn't in Trenton NJ, in
    1781.  That was in the middle of the Revolution, and I seriously
    doubt Washington would have time to pose for a portrait.  Nor was
    the bottom half ripped off.  As I recall, the painting was simply
    never finished."
    
>> Chemical Dumping Fill, aka Lucky Charms

The writers won't stop bagging on Lucky Charms.  Mark Richey says,
    "The other things Washington wanted on the flag is an obvious ref
    to Lucky Charms cereal, which has a truly disgusting grain part, as
    well as some pretty tasty marshmallows, as long as you don't put
    milk on them."  I beg to differ, though -- the marshmallows suck,
    the grain sucks... it sucks!  A piece of chemical tripe.

From Benjamin Robinson: "red hearts, yellow moons, green clovers, and
    orange (not white) stars were the original ingredients of this
    cereal (since then, General Mills has added blue diamonds, purple
    horseshoes, rainbow-colored rainbows, and replaced the yellow moons
    with yellow and orange pots of gold.  Also, I think there's some
    cereal in there, somewhere.)"

>> A Seafood Company Run By a (Cannibalistic) Fish

This is a famous American fast food seafood chain.  Mark Richey says,
    "I try to avoid them as much as possible."  I beg to differ --
    the fish is pretty good for fast food, which I like better than
    any dresscoded, long waiting restaurant which will always give
    you steak rare, every time.

Ahem... Long John Silver was also the name of the pirate in "Treasure
    Island" (recall back to 7F03), which is why the joke is so funny.

>> Dawes & Otis (Who?)

Mark Richey says, "There is a Charles Dawes (a former Vice President)
    and a James Otis (a colonial leader), but there was no record of
    any other Dawes or Otis in the encyclopedia."  Don Del Grande
    discovered the reference to William Dawes, though (see above).

>> Speculation on what "embiggen" and "cromulent" mean

Haynes Lee notes, "There is no entry for `embiggen' or `imbiggen' in
    the OED [I assume he means Old English Dictionary --ed]  However,
    there is one for `biggen', a 17th century word meaning `To increase
    in size' or `To recover strength after confinement'."  I observed
    that it's made up of "em-", a prefix meaning "adding" (as in
    `empower'), "big" (if you don't know what this means, call 1-800-
    ABCDEFG), and "-en" (a suffix making a noun a verb, as in `wisen'),
    so it could possibly mean "to make bigger".  Then again, I have
    waay too much time on my hands.

Also, it has been observed that "cromulent" might be a combination of
    the words "common" and "prominent" in some ambiguous way.

>> Ripley Scott and James Cameron (or, Sci-Fi Wunderkinds)

... are directors of sci-fi films.  Ripley Scott is well known for
    directing the "Alien" films, and James Cameron directed "The
    Terminator" and its sequel "Terminator 2: Judgement Day."

>> Ralph calling Teacher "Mommy"

You know, I can really relate to that, because one time I... hwa.
    Why don't I give you a ride home?...

>> Jonnycakes

John Lemme, a Rhode Island resident, tells us "Jonnycakes are thin
    fried cakes made out of cornmeal.  Picture a fried pancake made
    from a squashed corn muffin.  It's usually made with coarser grain,
    however.  They are a Rhode Island delicacy, so if you're not from
    RI, you'll probably never know they exist.  [until now --ed]
    They're delicious with butter, warm from the pan.  Yum!"

> Reviews
=======================================================================

Dale G. Abersold - Unlike "Lisa the Vegetarian," this portrayed Lisa's
    independent spirit without making her shrill and unlikeable.  The
    ending, unfortunately, was a copout (couldn't the writers have come
    up with anything better?) Lisa's portrayal and her relationship
    with Homer were just right.  So I'm a sucker for Lisa episodes; sue
    me!  A-.

Tom Baker - From me, a B.  A real disappointment that our great Lisa
    did not blow the lid off a cover-up.  OTOH, her reasoning was
    original and an accurate analysis of the situation, and left me
    thinking about the relative value of "truth" and "myth"....  Okay,
    sorta just kidding, but the episode both was funny and left a bad
    taste.  So a B.

Frederic Briere - After Who Shot Mr. Burns and Bart the Fink, I'm
    getting fed up with detective episodes; nonetheless, it can be an
    enjoyable episode, despite Homer's obnoxious yelling.  I wish
    someday we could move on to the sarcastic side of the show.
    Grade: C+

Don Del Grande - A good episode, albeit a good one-storyline episode.
    Nothing particularly sidesplitting about it.  B if you're a fan of
    Lisa the PC Thug; C if "Stupid Lisa History Queen" episodes rate up
    there with clip shows.

Oliver Dueck - Typical for this season. How low can it get? It just
    wasn't funny enough, and it seemed like Lisa and Homer were the
    only ones in existence; we hardly saw Bart or other characters. And
    the ending...it was not only predictable, but it was also bad.
    Rating: D+

Jeff Gustafson - This was a great episode compared to the last few
    they've shown.  Granted, it was slow at times, but it did have a
    lot of good jokes in it.  Hopefully this season will pick back up
    in the next few episodes. I'll give this one a B+.

Jason Hancock - Solid, but unspectacular.  The show started off too
    slowly and Homer's "town crier" role was overdone.  But this
    episode had some great lines -- the Long John Silver's swipe,
    Wiggum's ventriloquism, and Barney's "There's an exit?" stood out.
    I was surprised that Lisa didn't have the guts to wreck this event
    like she wrecked Whacking Day.  Grade:  B-

Jose Lafaurie - Pretty average episode, although there were some funny
    parts that stood out.  I really liked the character of Hollis
    Hurlbut -- conniving, cynical, yet modest and well-meaning.  The
    Jebediah flashbacks were truly classic, as well as Lisa's detective
    spirit as we previously saw in 2F20.  The lowlight of the episode
    was the end.  I Want Riot!  It would have added to the funny and
    hypothetical Simpsons humor that I loved.  They can be realistic,
    but c'mon they're cartoons!  Grade: B-.

Haynes Lee - Good episode but you think with all the knowledge Bart has
    with the history of Springfield that he will be given more than a
    few lines.  Grade: B+

Adam Lipkin - This episode got off to a slow start but picked up by the
    third act. The sordid history of Jebediah Springfield was neat, as
    was the curator of the historical society museum. Seeing Donald
    Sutherland's name under the Guest voice credit was a surprise. At
    least he didn't play himself. Grade: B.

Veronica Marquez - It was Sappy, but Third season sappy, so it's better
    than most.  C+

Daniel McCoy - I felt this was a definite improvement over 3F09, 3F11,
    and 3F12.  The storyline was solid, and it seemed that the pacing
    was back on track... best of all, the characters are back to acting
    like themselves again. ...I liked Donald Sutherland's guest
    voicing, especially his first appearence, talking into his coffee
    cup. ... I give it a solid B+

John Murray - Grade: C+.  I guess the trend of good episodes was only a
    fluke, yet another bad episode.  While some of the jokes helped
    redeemed the show.  This show had a half-decent plot but, lacked
    some of the elements that have classically made the Simpsons a
    great show, stuff such as a good number of good jokes, varying in
    complexity (sight gag to obscure movie ref) and a good sub plot.
    Episodes start to become boring with the shift of a good totally
    separate sub-plot.

Damian Penny - I really enjoyed this one - it doesn't surprise me that
    Lisa would fall into PC/revisionist history, and I loved Homer's
    attempts to be town crier.  Best scenes: Ms. Hoover's PC Thug
    line, Kearney's reminisce of the bicentennial, and the technical
    flaws in the historical film.  My only complaint is the ending,
    which I found a bit maudlin (I knew that, when they showed the
    "town spirit" stuff, that Lisa would back down.  Grade: B+

Mark Richey - Finally!  A terrific episode!  Easily the best one since
    3F06 (Mother Simpson).  The jokes were very funny, the characters
    stayed in character, and the sentiment was right on the money. 
    Donald Sutherland did the best guest spot since Glenn Close (and
    that includes the usually relibable Kelsey Grammer).  Lisa was on
    another rightous crusade, like in 3F03, but unlike that episode,
    she never became shrill and self-rightous.  Kudos to Yeardley
    Smith!  The only problem was that the show wasn't quite as funny as
    it could have been, but that's only a small quibble.  Grade: A

Benjamin Robinson - An unusual episode on many fronts, and better than
    many other recent "message" episodes.  "Lisa the Iconoclast" was
    interesting mainly for the nascent bond between Homer and Lisa, and
    for the fact that the message delivered differed from the one you
    were expecting.  (B+)

Dan Ryazansky - Finally, an excellent episode! (although not the best
    ending). I had more faith in Lisa than that. But Homer was great
    once again. George Washington vs. Jebediah fight was excellent. And
    Hans lives again! Easily the second best episode this year. (next
    to Treehouse VI.) A-

Rick Senger - An interesting idea but a thin installment.  We learned
    about Jebediah, but it should have been the "B" plotline -- not the
    basis for a whole 'sode!  Homer's turn as town crier and the
    Jebediah re-enactments were funny, but overall, a VERY low jokes
    per minute ratio.  Lisa's deduction of the silver tongue's
    location made NO sense, either.  Think about it.  Weak C.

Jim Smith - Hmmm... I don't know what to think of this ep. The first
    time I saw Bart the Fink, I thought it was terrible, but the second
    time, I thought it was hilarious. At first, I thought this one too
    horrible... however, right now I'm watching it again, and I'm
    liking it more and more... who knows. It's been a great season so
    far, hopefully I'll change my mind about this one.  My grade as it
    stands: A.

Yours Truly - Quite an embigenning episode.  "Lisa the Iconoclast"
    ventured back to the old days of OFS when the stories were
    interesting and the Simpsons were characterized normally.  Marge
    was slightly OOC, but more "human", much like 3F11.  Fave moment
    for me -- the vocal talents of Jebediah's skull.  I've been quoting
    that all this week... Not a lot of quotables, though.  I give it an
    A.

AVERAGE GRADE: B (3.08)

I hope they show the time where they traded guns to the Indians for

-- Bart watches "Young Jebediah Springfield", "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% The film is cheaply made.  After a "fight" with a "land cow",
% Jebediah is asked by a boy how he can hope to achieve such
% greatness.

 Jebediah: [on film] A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.
     Edna: Embiggens?  I never heard that word before I moved to

Ms.Hoover: I don't know why.  It's a perfectly cromulent word.
-- Nice supercalifragilisticexpialidocious word, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Skinner addresses the class after the film is over.

Skinner: Now, as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a
         week away.  Every class will do its part to make our local
         bicentennial just as memorable as our national bicentennial.
         Of course, you children are too young to remember that, with
         the possible exception of Kearney.
Kearney: [shaving] Those tall ships really lifted the nation's spirits
         after Watergate.
-- Quit bugging me about that stupid pirate, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Ms. Hoover tells the class that they are to do reports on Jebediah 
% and the top 18 essays will be put on file in the library.  Ralph asks
% if they can put pictures in it.  At home, Homer reads the news, and
% sees jobs available for the parade.  He wonders if he'll be a water
% churner, typhoid carrier, or an apprentice.

 Lisa: How about town crier?  You'd be great at that.
Homer: You think so?
 Bart: Well, yeah, Dad, you're a big fat loudmouth and you can walk
       when you have to.
-- Homer during the 200th anniversary of Springfield,
     "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Homer decides he'll do it.  Later, Lisa bikes to the Springfield
% Historical Society and checks out a little mechanized thing about
% river crossing.

Dangerous river crossings threatened life and limb but helped our
founding fathers save on bridge tolls.
-- Voiceover on a mechanized act of the founding of Springfield,
     "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% The voice turns out to be the curator, Hollis Hurlbut, talking into
% a coffee mug.

Hurlbut: Sorry if I startled you, but I do love to talk Jebediah, even
         when I'm drinking my chicory.
   Lisa: Hi, I'm Lisa Simpson.  I'm researching a report on Jebediah.
Hurlbut: Oh, you're in for a treat.  You know, some historians consider
        Jebediah a minor patriot, but I think you'll find he's easily
        the equal of William Dawes or even Samuel Otis.
-- Come again?, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Meanwhile, Homer runs ahead in line to audition for the town crier,
% but finds out Ned got the role.  Ned tries a pretty bad rendition.

  Homer: You su-diddely-uck, Flanders! [grabs a bell from him]
         Hear ye, hear ye!  Ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by 
         all!  Chooseth Homer Simpson, and he shalt rock thy world!
 Wiggum: Good God, he is fabulous.
Skinner: Yes, he's embiggened that role with his cromulent performance.
 Quimby: Top-notch criering, I admit, but the hat and bell belong to
         Ned Flanders, so no dice.
    Ned: Oh, they're just family heirlooms.  They shouldn't stand in
         the way of Homer taking my job.
  Homer: Less chat, more hat.
          [Ned hands it over.  Homer puts it on and it rips]
         Woo-hoo!  Hear ye, hear ye!  The Homer Broadcasting System is
         on the air!  All hollering, all the time!  I'm going to--

% Mr. Hurlbut continues to show Lisa around.

This case holds our most treasured exhibit: objects owned and used by

 This is his fife, upon which he sounded the sweet note of freedom.
 And his hatchet, with which he hacked at the chains of oppresions.

% sound a note on the fife.  But she succeeds only in blowing something
% out of the fife.  It's Jebediah's secret confessions.

Know ye who read this there is more to my life than history records.
Firstly, I did not tame the legendary buffalo.  It was already tame, I
merely shot it.  Secondly, I have not always been known as Jebediah
Springfield.  Until 1796, I was Hans Sprungfeld, murderous pirate, and
the half-wits of this town shall never learn the truth!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-
ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

   Lisa: It's just the excitement from studying Jebediah.
Hurlbut: Looks like you've come down with a serious case of Jebeditis.

Homer: Ooh.
-- Homer gets his role as town crier, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

% Lisa tells Homer the story of Jebediah/Hans.

 Lisa: Jebediah Springfield was really a vicious pirate named Hans
       Sprungfeld.  His tongue was bitten off by a Turk in a grog house
       fight.
Homer: No tongue, eh?  How did he talk and eat [melodramatically] and
       laugh and love?
 Lisa: He had it replaced with a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
Homer: Yes, that'll do.

Hoover: Ralph, A.  Janey, A.  And Lisa, for your, ahem, essay "Jebediah
        Springfield: Super Fraud", F.
  Lisa: But it's all true.
Hoover: [scoffs] This is nothing but dead, white male-bashing from a PC

% would rather get the confession.  Homer sticks with the bat idea,
% though.

% At the historical society, Homer and Lisa go after Jebediah's fife.
% Mr. Hurlbut scans it briefly and dismisses it.

Hurlbut: I think, Lisa, that you've been taken in by an obvious
         forgery.  Unfortunately, historical research is plagued by
         this sort of hoax -- the so-called confession.  It's just
         as fake as the Howard Hughes will, the Hitler Diaries, or the
         Emancipation Retraction.
   Lisa: But it explains why there's no record of Jebediah Springfield
         before 1796.  He was Hans Sprungfeld until then.
Hurlbut: That's preposterous.  Get out!  You're banned from this
         historical society!  You, and your children, and your
         children's children -- for three months.

Clerk: OK, 100 yellow.
-- At a copy center, "Lisa the Iconoclast"

Comic book guy: Question: is your name Ripley Scott or James Cameron?

                computers threaten our personal liberties, I will know

        Shut up, you bums, shut up!

  Lisa: Ahem.  Jebediah Springfield was nothing more than a murderous

         [barflies and Moe's jaws drop]
   Moe: Good God!  Homer, I support, you know, any prejudice you can
        name, but this hero-phobia sickens me.  All right, you and your
