Couch:          The family runs in to watch some TV, only to find what seems
                like the entire city sitting in their living room.  They are
                lined up in rows, as if in a movie theater.  Homer sneaks some
                popcorn from Comic Book Guy, who is sitting in the next row.

*  Actually, the site of the "next" Olympics is chosen before the "last"
   Olympics start.  The only exceptions were when there was a break because of
   war or when a city was selected but later withdrew, like Denver did prior
   to the 1976 Winter Olympics.  {ddg}

   U.S. until at least 2016.  [Of course, it's a commission's prerogative to
   change its mind -- Ed.]  {al}

*  Even if Springfield lost the Games to the town right next to them, they
   would still host a few events for sure, since Shelbyville definitely does
   not have all the necessary facilities.  No Olympics have ever been held
   exclusively in one city.  {al}

*  Springfield couldn't lose its Olympics bid at the last second to
   Shelbyville because each country can only have one city nominated in the

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Nate Birch:  Unfortunately we seem to have another episode on our hands, that
   lacks any actual plot; instead we have a bunch of only sorta related
   events, mixed with some few laughs at the old folk's expense.  Grampa
   Simpson has always been one of the funniest characters and the scenes at
   the old folk home weren't too bad, but could have been better (what was
   with the native guy jumping in and out of the window?), but the Homer
   subplot was idiotic, and in light of the recent Olympic scandal,  this
   episode completely failed to make fun of the Olympic committee, Bart's
   "comedy routine" was one of the least humorous things I've ever heard him
   say, need I go on?  Oh yeah, animation sucked too, and I mean ever worse
   than usual for season 10.  (C-)

Ben Collins:  This outrageously lame episode starts with an over-the-top
   ridiculous scenario and goes downhill from there.  It shamelessly borrows
   bits and pieces from other episodes, from the title on.  The humor is
   horribly timed, and the gags have that annoying "in-your-face" quality.  At
   the end, it turns out that the episode exists for one reason and one reason
   only: for a "Titanic" spoof, which doesn't go over very well.  It also
   turns out that Mike Scully hired writer Julie Thacker for one reason and
   one reason only: because she's his wife.  (D)

Lucas Cox:  Ick, I know some of you folks liked this one, but I didn't care
   for it at all.  I found Bart's comedy routine irritating and cliched, and
   this episode really didn't tell us anything about the old folks home that
   we didn't already know IMO.  The spring subplot was ok, Homer bouncing
   Maggie around like a basketball was a pretty good scene, but the rescue of
   the sinking ship was yet another contrived ending of the likes I'm getting
   really sick of.  Also, what's with all the repeated lines?  "You sunk my
   battleship" "Not a looker among them!" and a few others.  (D+)

Nathan DeHoff:  The plot didn't really go much of anywhere, but it was
   creative, and contained many good laughs.  The references to "A Hard Day's
   Night" and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" were excellent.  (Yes, I know
   they've already referenced the latter, but the references in this episode
   were still funny.)  The spring subplot was basically just an excuse for
   silly visual gags, but it was amusing, and fit into the episode fairly
   well. It was also nice to see an episode where Homer wasn't the main focus
   (although the current writers don't seem to be able to write an episode
   without at least a subplot devoted to him).  (B+)

Don Del Grande:  This one actually had the laughs going for it, although the
   ending was a little thin, but the entire Olympics opening bit just stood
   there like a breakdown on the freeway.  (B+)

Yuri Dieujuste:  I guess Bart no longer deserves decent episodes.  The whole
   plot line of giving the Springfield the Olympics should have been replaced
   with a typical Bart got in trouble line.  The only enjoyable part of the
   episode was when the elderly population of Springfield was spending the day
   in the park with "Can't Buy Me Love"  as the background music.  I won't
   even bother with Homer's dumb-ass sub-plot.  (F)

Jordan Eisenberg:  A refreshing plot idea that kinda' sorta' works.  The Homer
   subplot was a stupid and lame premise that ended up giving us some of the
   funniest things in the episode, and at least it tied back in with the main
   plot (in a very cartoonish way).  The setup was the best part of the show,
   as usual, but they could've thought up so many other ways to have Bart
   insult the other nations! A real wasted premise.  I laughed a few times,
   and it wasn't really painful to watch, but the new episodes are just
   getting harder and harder to look forward to.  (B-)

Curtis Gibby:  Meh.  I didn't dislike this one for any particular reason, it
   just didn't speak to me.  There were several good gags (one being the
   Native American throwing the drinking fountain *back* into the room through
   another window to get his hat), but on the whole, not a terribly funny
   episode, which is a main reason I watch the Simpsons.  (C+)

Andrew Gill:  On the whole, I liked this episode.  This episode had much to
   offer in the way of subtlety, and much to offer in characterization.  When
   we get down to the nitty-gritty, however, this episode suffers from serious
   lapses in believability.  Bart's interests show once again that he is
   someone who seriously cares about people, and that he's working to make a
   difference.  The spring thing was kinda stupid, and a bit too cartoony for
   my tastes.  We are, however, on the right track.  (B)

Joe Green:  This was an OK episode.  The premise was a good one, and the fact
   that it didn't revolve around Homer was refreshing.  On the other hand, the
   absurd ending and the gratuitous Jack LaLanne cameo took things down a
   notch.  (B-)

John Isles IV:  This episode had a good first act, but faltered at the start
   of act 2, and dropped dead halfway through the episode.  The thought of an
   Olympic-based was a good idea, and should have been built on instead of
   being dropped.  Unfortunately, the sub-plot with the springs was bad at
   best.  The only really good portion of this one was Bart vacuuming Abe.
   (F)

Carl Johnson:  More Season 10 numbness.  The Cuckoo's Nest thing has been done
   before, but throwing the water fountain back into the room was slightly
   funny.  I'd have to say I like the ending-- it actually ties in with the
   otherwise pointless subplot.  The plot is pretty well defined, unlike most
   of Seasons 9 and 10-- that is, all the loose ends are tied up in this
   episode.  It does meander, but that's to be expected these days.  The
   writer didn't do a very good job with the issue of "living it up."  It
   wasn't done much better in "Old Money."  The jabs at old people were kind
   of immature, and the Battleship line was only slightly amusing-- the first
   time.  I guess that's what the Simpsons is now-- immature. The writers
   don't seem to go deeper than what's there.  [...]  I guess it wasn't that
   bad for Season 10, though.  (B)

Darrel Jones:  Another decent Season Ten effort.  Homer's spring subplot was a
   delightful diversion.  The best parts included Jasper vs. the Crazy Old Man
   (caneplay), the re-lighting of the Tire Yard Fire, and the unexpected
   rescue of the boat.  Not much stood out, though, especially after a funny
   Family Guy.  A 7/10  (B-)

Haynes Lee:  The Bart plot would have been good if the bonehead Homer plot
   didn't ruin it.  And another 5 second guest star role. The spring scene in
   the bar was especially painful to watch.  (C-)

Jake Lennington:  Well, it wasn't the most emotionally deep episode that has
   ever aired, but the stockpile of hilarious cartoon gags saved it from being
   another bland season ten showing.  IMO, the best sight-gag was Maggie
   bouncing around the kitchen and landing in her high-chair!  Also, the idea
   of Bart working in an old folks home was simple and effective, while the
   Homer vs. the springs subplot was a nice diversion.  (A-)

Andrew Levine:  The Simpsons often has jokes that stereotype old people, and
   they're often funny (such as Abe's pointless stories and the Crazy Old
   Man's antics).  It is NOT funny when you throw 31 (by my count) senior
   citizen jokes in one episode. It didn't help that we never got acquainted
   with any of the seniors, so we couldn't even feel sympathy for them when we
   were supposed to.  The springs in the eyes were one of the most disgusting
   things I have ever seen on the show. Homer was a class-A jerkass and I only
   liked the Hard Day's Night parodies.  I hoped that after "Homer's Enemy" I
   would never have to give out an F grade again.  I was wrong.  (F)

Ondre Lombard:  The whole Springfield-Olympics part was a good idea, but it's
   too bad it carries over into the main plot in a relatively predictable
   manner. ("Everything's going so well, and then Bart gets on stage -- fill
   in the blanks.")  To get to the point, there's not a lot that's special
   about this episode, but there were some isolated gags and one liners that
   made me laugh (including parts of the overall dumb as hell Homer-spring
   plot).  Bart the hero is fine by me; Lisa is fine by me; but who else is
   tired of old people being portrayed as warped, absent-minded aliens who
   require all of this oddball special help?  And I don't think I need to
   reiterate how boring "wacky Homer idea" plots are.  (C)

Patrick McGovern:  Not incredibly strong, but fairly funny nonetheless.  Some
   gags (The entire Titanic thing, Bart's comic routine) were truly funny.
   Others (Skinner punching Homer over and over, the saving of the ship)
   weren't.  But still, it definitely had shades of season 4 in the
   characterization.  But while I'd give bonus points for the entire Native
   American Casino bit, they get taken away because of the gratuitous (And
   pointless) Jack LaLanne cameo.  They could've done a lot with that, but
   they didn't.  Still fairly good.  (B-)

Tom Rinschler:  What a wonderful episode!  It possessed both a good plot and
   subplot, lots of screen time for Bart and Lisa, some nice commentary on the
   boring life of the elderly, and loads of laughs as well.  Granted, the
   Native American scene was puzzling, the spring-in-the-eye scene was a bit
   macabre (if guiltily funny as well), and both the pulling-the-sinking-ship
   and the bouncing-sinking-ship scenes a bit over-the-top cartoonish, but
   these were minor blemishes on an otherwise solid episode.  (A)

Gary Wilson:  It was written by a new writer (I think) and it showed.  It had
   a couple of decent gags, but the whole show seemed odd and not a single
   joke was worthy of more than a chuckle.  The main plot was a nice idea and
   Bart's character was handled well, however, I really thought Homers
   sub-plot (should the word "plot" be used?) was ridiculously inane.  (C+)

Yours Truly:  It's a decent surreal episode, but would have been better as a
   more "realistic" satirical show.  The writers did better with their
   decision to make Bart, rather than Lisa the central character.  It was a
   pleasant break from audience expectation, plus the task of livening up the
   old folk's home suits his personality well.  Homer's spring-selling subplot
   was uneven, but had its moments.  On the whole, I'd give it a C+, but a
   high  (C+)

AVERAGE GRADE:  C+ (2.32)   Std Dev.: 1.1696   (24 reviews computed)

Several people noted that NRBQ performed the song for the show.  Gary Lambert
   adds:  this was the Q's third (and most extensive) soundtrack appearance on
   "The Simpsons" this year, and the first recorded especially for the show
   (the first two were very brief snippets of older songs -- "Wild Weekend" on
   the Super Bowl episode, and "12 Bar Blues" in the Homer-as-trucker show).

   Mike Scully, Executive Producer of "The Simpsons" is a huge fan of NRBQ,

>> Olympic Boom Towns

Benjamin Robinson writes:  Having the Olympics booked in your town is
   something of a mixed blessing.  On the up side, your community is
   memorialized forever as being one of the preeminent spots on the globe.
   Hordes of journalists descend on the city, providing free tourist publicity
   as well as sports coverage.  Speaking of tourists, the Olympics are
   obviously a big draw, and some of those people might decide to return to
   the area after the festivities are over.

   The drawbacks aren't as readily evident until it's too late. Explosive
   growth of the games brings more people to the city than the infrastructure
   can reasonably handle (and this is true for just about any place on the
   globe).  Building or upgrading facilities is often a heavy drain on city
   coffers, diverting funds critics contend are best spent on more long-range
   goals.  Further, the boom can be quickly followed by a bust.  Barcelona's
   economy went south after the 1992 Olympics closed, and former Olympic
   status didn't stop civil war from breaking out in Sarajevo.  (I think most
   of fighting has now shifted to the south, though.)  That's if everything
   goes perfectly.  Munich and Atlanta have had to contend with terrorist
   attacks, and officials in Salt Lake City stand accused of bribing officials
   to host the games, which will cast a pall on the festivities in 2002.


Speaking of Sarajevo, Evan Ross has this to say:  During Principal Skinner's
   speech on how hosting the Olympics could help Springfield's economy, he
   mentions how the Olympics caused a "boom" in Sarajevo.  Sarajevo held the
   Olympics in 1984, and after the event, civil war broke out and Yugoslavia
   turned into a war zone.  Landmines, grenades, and armed troops all became
   commonplace during the fighting.  The war was supposed to end when
   Yugoslavia split into different nations, but now [30 April 1999, when this
   was written -- Ed.] it still isn't the case.  Just one look at Kosovo would
   tell you that.  That wouldn't be something I would think Springfield would
   want.


Patrick Geahan adds:  Sarajevo did experience an economic boom after the 84
   Olympics.  At the very least, they experienced an economic upswing.
   Yugoslavia was a nice little country until Slobodan Milosevic got in there
   and mucked it all up.  There's a book I read when I took a class on the
   Yugoslav deal, and it showed a picture of the Sarajevo Olympic stadium in
   1984, and the empty killing field where it is now.  Very haunting photo.


>> So that's what he's been doing!

Andrew Levine informs us:  In case you didn't notice, the Polish
   representative to the IOC seemed to resemble Lech Walesa.  Walesa was the
   leader of the Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980's that ended
   Communist rule there.  He was elected the first president of Poland in
   1991.


>> Unrequited admiration

Lisa may not be thrilled with the Backstreet Boys, but they like her.  Joanna
   Boese explains:  Nick Carter (The blonde one for those not in the know)
   says this is one of his favorite series.  And in some interviews, AJ (The
   one with the tattoos and different hair color every week) has been known to
   do a little Homer imitation.  D'oh!


>> What *was* that, exactly?

Lucas Cox:  The Atlanta "Whatzit" was the mascot of the 1996 Olympic games, or
   at least, it was supposed to be.  I remember when it was first announced
   that the games were to be in Atlanta, it was all over the place, but pretty
   soon some people began complaining that it was stupid, and that it would
   turn the city into a laughing stock.  So the "Whatzit" barely even showed
   up during the games.


Benjamin Robinson adds:  The reaction to "Whatzit" was almost immediately
   negative. The mascot looked like nothing so much as a giant spermatozoa
   made out of sparkle gel toothpaste.  "What is it," indeed!  "Whatzit" was
   essentially shunned from souvenirs and graphics, and American television
   network NBC even had some fun at his expense, making a "mockumentary" of
   his fall from grace into a rehab center.  Oh, well, at least memento makers
   had four years to scale down their production plans, to avoid taking too
   much of a bath on "Whatzit" merchandise.


Lucas Cox, again:  The "Montreal Vampire" I think is just a reference to how
   poorly the games were handled by Montreal in 1976, I believe the city went
   bankrupt because of them.

Dale G. Abersold adds:  Let's not forget Humptulips, WA.  Washington: Home of
   more amusing place names than any other state.


Dave Gauvin:  There's a town in Newfoundland, Canada called Come-by-Chance,
   and another called Dildo.  There's a bay called Placentia Bay.  It's true,
   check your atlas.


Todd Emerson:  And let's not get into how they pronounce "Regina" up there ...


Matt Rose:  A guy on the radio recently said he drove from Medicine Lodge, KS

   medicine lodge for protection so he could go straight through hooker :)  (I
   actually checked this on a map ... turns out you'd have to backtrack a
   little, but eh, close enough)


Benjamin Robinson:  The places Chalmers mentioned are all real.  Queens is the
   most famous; it's one of the boroughs of New York City.  (Brooklyn is in
   Kings county, completing the pair.)  Ball State University is in Indiana,
   which is not called the Ball State.  Instead, it is named for the Ball
   corporation, a maker of glass jars for food preserves.  David Letterman is
   the arguably the university's most well-known alumnus. Intercourse is a
   town in Pennsylvania's Amish country [as we've seen -- Ed.].  Finally, Lake
   Titicaca is in South America.  According to the "Beavis & Butt-Head FAQ"
   ("B&B" used this joke, too), Titicaca is located at one of the highest
   altitudes on Earth.


[The point has pretty much been made, so we won't be adding any more Funny
   Place Names to this capsule -- Ed.]


>> My Home Town

Benjamin Robinson:  Without reading the other reviews, I can predict that
   someone will call as a goof the fact that Chalmers omitted Utica from the
   list of places he's from.  (He claimed to be from Utica in "Twenty-Two
   Short Stories About Springfield (3F18).")  I argue that he was born in
   Queens, but spent part of his early childhood in Utica before going to
   Indiana's Ball State University.  He just didn't feel it was worth
   mentioning to Bart.  Besides, you can't make double- entendres out of
   "Utica" like you can with "Intercourse, PA."


>> Native American Gambling Enterprises, formerly Chief Crazy Casino

Even a joke in passing can have a story behind it, as Ben Collins proves:  The
   1998 election was a blockbuster for ballot initiatives.  Debates over such
   issues as gay marriage and "partial-birth" abortion played out at the
   ballot box.  California, the state that started the national tax revolt in
   1978 when Proposition 13 was overwhelmingly approved, had a few
   controversial initiatives.  One of them was Proposition 5, which sought to
   preserve the right of California Indian tribes to operate gambling casinos.

   For the past 20 years or so, Native American tribes have had the federally-
   guaranteed right to run gambling casinos on reservation lands, provided
   that the profits go to reservation improvement projects.  The funds have
   gone to assist non-gaming reservations as well as gaming tribes, in many
   cases providing basic services such as running water and electric power to
   remote regions that have never enjoyed such benefits.  In response to a
   campaign spearheaded by Nevada casino interests, with the support of then-
   Governor Pete Wilson (R-CA), to tighten regulations on California tribes,
   several of the major tribes gathered signatures to put an initiative
   (Proposition 5) on the ballot for the 1998 gubernatorial election.  They
   called themselves Californians for Indian Self-Reliance, and ran an
   intensive advertising campaign.  The initiative mostly preserves the
   current system, but loosens some regulations, mostly on the types of games
   and slot machines available for use in tribal casinos.  The Nevada casinos
   responded aggressively, pooling their resources into an organization they
   christened the Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling.  The Coalition ran
   an aggressive campaign against Proposition 5, which cited dire predictions
   of increased crime and deceptively alleged that a minority of tribes were
   seeking a "special deal" for exemption from environmental laws.  Given the
   California Indians' tradition of respect for the environment and regard of
   all living things as a gift from the Great Spirit, the No on 5 campaign
   made a fatal move accusing Indians of spoiling the environment.  The
   initiative overwhelmingly passed, with more than 60 percent of the vote.
   The Nevada casinos sued immediately, and the initiative is still lost in
   the courts as of now.  All in all, considering both the Yes on 5 and No on
   5 campaigns, it was the most expensive ballot-measure campaign in
   California history, perhaps in the history of the nation.


>> "Damn the torpedoes!"

Tom Rinschler gives us the origins of this phrase:  When Bart yells "Damn the
   torpedoes!", he is quoting Admiral David Farragut, who  said it during the
   Battle of Mobile Bay in 1864 when the ships under his command were moving
   timidly to avoid the minefields instead of resolutely forward as he wanted.


>> "Don't worry, I'll save you the Jack LaLanne way!"

Haynes Lee:  Jack LaLanne is the host of the longest running exercise show and
   turned 80 in 1994.  As a child he was addicted to sugar which caused him to
   pull some Bart Simpson pranks such as setting his parents' house on fire.
   As a result he was put on a health regime which set him straight.


Don Del Grande:  Jack LaLanne really does (or at least did) pull boats in the
   water.


Ondre Lombard adds:  Recently in the 90s he started peddling a juicer in
   infomercials (just as Jay Kordich did), and a fruits and vegetables diet
   for health.  At some point (I don't know if he still does this), on each
   birthday, he would pull as many boats as his age while swimming.  This was
   often displayed in his infomercials for the Juice Tiger juicer.


>> Those Immortal Threads

 - Is Smithers Gay?

Haynes Lee:  [He] got discharged from the U.S. Navy for his suggestive
   paintings.


Someone known only as "GRiM" counter:  Smithers didn't say he was discharge
   *for* the paintings, he just said he used to paint them *before* he was
   discharged.


 - Where is Springfield?

Evan Ross:  Since this episode confirms that Springfield has a beach, that
   must mean Springfield borders either the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans.  Such
   a quantity of needles couldn't happen in a lake or river, and I don't think
   that the cruise boat at the end would be in danger of sinking in
   freshwater.


>> I thought something was missing

Ryan Mead observes:  I believe this is the first time in Simpsons history that
   the 20th Century Fox Television logo was not played with its dramatic
   fanfare.


Alex Flandonwittsy:  You know, I noticed that too.  Ever since Futurama has
   been toying around with the coveted name(30th Century FOX), I think the
   execs at FOX have loosened up some.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  The Spring Olympics


Jordan Eisenberg's Alterna-alterna-title:  "A Forced Volunteer Story"


Andrew Andagainma suggests:  Five Rings and a Thousand Springs


Jake Lennington suggests:  The Good, the Bad, and the Springy


Andrew Andagainma:  Bart a C student?  Doesn't that overrate his academic
   performance?


Don Del Grande:  I wonder if those IOC rings would have been correct had this
   been an NBC show?


Steve Portigal:  I missed the standard Simpsons font during the end credits.
   Kinda freaked me out.


Tom Rinschler:  The sign in front of the Olympic Committee HQ says "Now with
   Myanmar!". Myanmar is the country known until a few years ago as Burma.

Bart:		That's the prize?  A banana?
Lisa:		Their natural mushiness prevents choking and 
		promotes regularity.
Bart:		They're not babies, Lisa, give 'em something fun, 
		like cigars or booze.
Lisa:		We tried giving them eggnog at Christmas but it led 
		to wide spread de-shawling.
Crazy Old Man:	That's what you get for wearing such tight little 
		shawls.  [takes the shawl off of Garter Lady, to her 
		surprise] 
Nurse:		Okay, 4:00 nap-time.  [the old folks all start 
		sleeping in an instant] 
Bart:		You tell them when to sleep?
Lisa:		Shh!  Don't wake them. [the nurse and Lisa start 
		vacuuming the old folks' faces with mini-vacs] 
Nurse:		While they sleep, we suck up excess dirt and crumbs.  
		[Lisa hands the vac to Bart] 
Lisa:		Here you go -- make sure you get into every crevice.
		[Bart walks over to Abe and starts vacuuming.  When 
		he does, he sees it makes him look like Homer] 
Bart:		Cool! [alternatively pressing the vacuum to Grampa's 
		face and removing it] Grampa, Homer.  Grampa, Homer 
		...
Nurse:		Don't play with the faces.

% Bart discusses the day's events with his family.

Marge:	So, Bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism?
Bart:	That place sucks!  The nurses don't let Grandpa do 
	anything.  They practically chew his food for him. 
Homer:	[struggling to cut his steak] Lucky stiff; I'm working my 
	ass off here.  [looks at Marge.  Marge gives him a mean 
	look] Good steak, honey.
Lisa:	The elderly aren't like you or me Bart.  They thrive on 
	consistency, predictability, and a life of no surprises.
Marge:	Sounds good to me!
-- I figured it would, "The Old Man and the 'C' Student"

% The doorbell rings.  It's a delivery man with a big box of springs,
% which Homer had been planning to use as raw material for his mascot. 
% Even though Springfield has lost the Olympics to Shelbyville, Homer
% thinks he'll have no problem unloading 1,000 springs.  Why the idiot
% population alone should account for more sales than that!
%
% Back at the retirement home, the old folks are watching "Gone with
% the Wind."

Scarlett:	Oh Rhett, Rhett!  Oh, Rhett, where will I go?  
		What'll I do?
Rhett:		Frankly my dear, [switch voices] I love you.  Let's 
		remarry.
		[The end credits come up, reading, "THE END -- 
		EDITED FOR SENIORS."  Everyone claps and whistles] 
Garter Lady:	Oh, what a lovely ending.
Abe:		That's sweet.
Bart:		They cut out the best word!
Moleman:	Didn't that movie used to have a war in it?
		[two guards walk over to him] 
Orderly:	Come on, get up.  You've been warned.
-- This picture not suitable for adults, "The Old Man and the 'C' Student"

% Lisa leads the old folks in something called, "imagination time."

Lisa:	Picture yourself on a beautiful sailboat.
	[the tape plays relaxing ocean noises while the people sit 
	in life preservers and sailors hats imagining themselves 
	on a sailboat] 
	Ah, can't you just feel the sea breeze in your hair ... or 
	scalps?
Bart:	Hey, I hear a foghorn:  BOOOR-RRRRRING!
Nurse:	Come on, Bart, we don't want to over-stimulate these 
	people.  They just had pudding.
-- That could get messy, "The Old Man and the 'C' Student"

% Homer, wearing a suit covered in springs, walks up to the Skinners'
% house and rings the doorbell.  Agnes answers.

Homer:		Hello, little girl, is your mommy home?  You'll need 
		to ask her for $5 to buy Mr. Bouncy Best-friend.
Agnes:		I know you -- your little smart-mouth boy cost this 
		town the Olympics.  [slaps Homer]
Skinner:	Who is it, mother?
Agnes:		It's Bart Simpson's father.
Skinner:	Oh, I'll be right down.  [He comes down and punches 
		Homer.  Homer falls down, but the springs push him 
		back up.  This repeats six times] 
-- "The Old Man and the 'C' Student"

% Since door-to-door sales didn't pan out, Homer tries another
% strategy.  Remembering the novelty can of nuts that hides a spring-
% loaded fake "snake," he crams one of the springs in a phony can of
% nuts.  Unfortunately, the spring is far too powerful.  When Lenny
% opens the can the spring pounces out, and catches him in the eye. 
% (Ouch!)  As Lenny stumbles around in pain, Moe asks Homer to leave
% the tavern.  Homer offers Moe a can of party nuts, which Moe
% accepts.  Surprise!  It has another one of those springs in it --
% and it lodges around Moe's eye.  He and Lenny bump into one another,
% and their springs get caught together, trapping the two men.  Lenny
% instinctively pulls back, causing more pain for him and Moe.
%
% At the retirement home, imagination time draws to a close.

Lisa:		Now we're pulling into port ... [gasps] and who's 
		waiting for us at the dock?  Why, it's all your 
		childhood dogs!  I see Petey, and Blackey, and 
		Schnoodle ...
Bart:		Oh no!  Pirates!
Jasper:		Pirates!?
Bart:		Ahoy Mateys, it's me, Long Bart Silver.  And I'm 
		gonna rip you a new IV hole [everybody gasps] 
Lisa:		Bart, what are you doing?
Bart:		I'm just trying to liven things up around here.  
		These people need to ride motorcycles and play 
		rockin' guitars like the old people on TV.
Crazy Old Man:	Excuse me, but when those pirates boarded I 
		swallowed my wedding ring for safe keeping.  Get 
		some ipecac; I'd like to expunge it.
		[Lisa leaves to get the ipecac] 
Bart:		Okay, she's gone.  Let's break out of here and have 
		some fun.
		[The old people murmur amongst themselves] 
Abe:		If I get up, somebody'll take my chair.
Jasper:		You got that right.  It's the only one left with 
		padding 
		[the old people touch the padding and say, 
		"padding," in a monotone voice] 
Bart:		[to an old Native American man] What about you, 
		chief?  Don't you wanna be free like the eagle?
Chief:		Oh, I don't live here.  I'm dropping off Indian 
		Casino Pamphlets.  Vote yes on prop 217.
		[The chief leaves by braking the window with a water 
		fountain, and jumping through the broken glass.  
		Crazy Old Man comes over] 
Crazy Old Man:	You know, the door was open, Chief Break-everything!
Bart:		Come on people, you don't want to stay in a place 
		where they vacuum you while you sleep.
Jasper:		They do what know?
Bart:		Now's our chance.  Let's go! [the old people agree 
		and follow Bart.  Lisa comes back] 
Lisa:		Oh no, Bart has stolen the elderly!
		[the chief breaks the window with another water 
		fountain, and jumps back in] 
Chief:		Forgot my hat.  [gives Lisa a pamphlet, then runs 
		away]

% [End of Act 2.  Time:  5:30  Running time:  13:46] 
%
% "Can't Buy Me Love" plays while the elderly, followed by Bart run
% out.  While they are running the Crazy Old Man falls, but no one
% notices.  Jasper, Garter Lady, and three others lay down so when
% they stick their hands out they make a star, when seen from above. 
% Grandpa jumps into the air.  The shot is in slow-motion, making it
% look as though he is floating in mid-air.  The old people roll
% around an empty pool like they're skateboarding in a half-pipe. 
% Garter Lady is then seen floating in the air, like Grandpa was.
%
% Jasper and Crazy Old Man are fighting with their canes, holding them
% like swords.  When Crazy Old Man knocks the cane out of Jasper's
% hand and has him cornered at a wall, Jasper takes his leg off and
% defends.
%
% The Crazy Old Man is floating.  Cut to a shot of the old folks
% running the other way, and Crazy Old Man falls down again.  Jasper
% side-hops to one side and falls down.  Jasper, Garter Lady and the
% three other people are shown in the star again.  Jasper hops to the
% other side and falls down.  More skateboarding in the pool.  The
% footage of the cane fight is shown again, running backward.  They
% run forward and Crazy Old Man, Garter Lady, Abe and another person
% fall down in the star position.  Abe pricks himself with the grass,
% and complains that grass today is sharper than when he was a boy.

Bart:		Hey everybody!  How'd you like to go on a real boat 
		trip?
		[all of them agree and run onto the boat] 
Cap'n:		Argh, not a looker among em'.
Bart:		Full speed ahead.  Damn the torpedoes!
Abe:		What'd he say?  "Put on our tuxedos?"
Crazy Old Man:	I want some Taquitos.

% Homer tries yet another use for his cache of springs.

Homer:	Welcome to the kitchen of tomorrow ... today.  Marge, how 
	much would you pay for a self-flipping hamburger pan?
Marge:	Nothing.
Homer:	Don't answer yet.  Watch how easy it is to flip hamburgers 
	with the help of God's greatest creation ... the spring!
	[Homer has attached springs to the bottom of a pan.  In 
	the pan, some hamburgers are frying.  Homer uses the 
	springs to flip the pan.  The burgers fly up vigorously, 
	then come back down hitting the oil.  The oil spatters on 
	Homer and the curtains, setting both aflame.  Homer rolls 
	around, trying to put the fire out.  Marge gets the fire 
	extinguisher, and puts out the curtains, the pan, and 
	Homer -- in that order] 
Marge:	Are you okay?
Homer:	Some second-degree burns ... but some first-class burgers!
Marge:	[groans] I want you to get rid of these springs.
Homer:	But you haven't seen the baby of tomorrow!  [picks up 
	Maggie, who is covered in springs] Ta-dah!  Now if I drop 
	her, no more tears.
	[hums "Sweet Georgia Brown" while spinning the baby on his 
	finger, then around his shoulders] 
Marge:	Give me my baby!
Homer:	[starts dribbling Maggie] D it up Marge, I'm going to the 
	hole!  [Marge tries to stop him but he gets around her and 
	dribbles Maggie up to the table.  He shoots, and Maggie 
	bounces off the wall and into her chair] 
Marge:	I want these springs out of our house today!
-- "The Old Man and the 'C' Student"

% Homer obliges his wife.

Homer:	[singing to the tune of "999 bottles of beer on the wall"] 
	... you flush one down, it swirls around, 999 springs to 
	flush down.
Marge:	You're not flushing those springs down out toilet are you?
Homer:	Of course not!  [continues singing.  The toilet flushes 
	and we hear the sound of metal scraping across porcelain] 
	996 springs to flush down, 996 springs ...
-- ... you flush one down, it swirls around ..., "The Old Man and the
   'C' Student"

% On the party boat, 40s dance music is playing, and the old folks 
dance on the deck.

I haven't felt this relaxed and carefree since I was watch commander 
at Pearl Harbor.
-- Abe Simpson, "The Old Man and the 'C' Student"

% As Bart grumbles about the lack of Russian subs in the area, Lisa
% walks up and startles him.

Lisa:		Bart, are you crazy?  We've got to get the old folks 
		home to the old folks' home!
Bart:		No way, Lis, they're finally having some fun.
		[Abe is at a limbo stick] 
Abe:		How low can I go?  [He goes under the stick cracking 
		his back while underneath it] Oh, that's it
Lisa:		Hey, maybe you're right.  They don't even seem to 
		care that it's medication time!
Old Folks:	Medication time!  Hot dog!  I want the blue ones!  
		[etc.] 
Bart:		But I set you free!  No more nap time.  No more 
		bingo.  You can do whatever you want ...
Garter Lady:	Let's play Bingo!  [everybody murmurs agreement] 
Jasper:		You sunk my battleship! [everybody laughs] 
Bart:		Oh ...

% In the meantime, Burns and Smithers sail on Burns's yacht.  Smithers
% paints a nude portrait of Burns, assuring his boss that he painted
% all his Navy buddies that way.  (Until he was discharged.)
%
% Back on the party boat, Abe tells Bart the old folks were following
% Bart around as something to do until bingo time.  Suddenly, they
% crash into Burns's yacht.  Lisa angrily asks Cap'n McAllister how he
% missed seeing the other boat, and the Cap'n explains he has *two*
% glass eyes.

Bart:		Oh, it's not fair.  I'm not supposed to die now.  
		I'm supposed to die in a foolish motorcycle stunt at 
		the age of 15.
LaLanne:	Ha, ha, you're not dead yet you pudgy little pisher.
Bart +
  Lisa:		Jack LaLanne!
LaLanne:	Don't worry, I'll save you the Jack LaLanne way!
		[he puts a rope in his mouth, jumps in the water, 
		and pulls the boat with his teeth.  In this process, 
		he breaks off the front part of the boat and swims 
		away with it, leaving everyone else on the back 
		half] 
Garter Lady:	This is all Bart's fault.
Jasper:		Get him!
Garter Lady:	I blame him!
Jasper:		He killed us all!
Crazy Old Man:	I want some Taquitoes.
Abe:		Leave him alone!  Sure, Bart's responsible for our 
		deaths but he gave us the most fun we had in 20 
		years.  So before we go to our watery graves, I 
		think we should ...
		[the boat sinks below the surface of the water.  
		Abe's voice gurgles.  Suddenly, the boat pops back 
		up, only to sink again.  It does this three more] 
Lisa:		What the heck's going on?
		[cut to the bottom of the ocean.  A pile of Homer's 
		springs sit on the ocean floor] 
Homer:		[voice echoed through the pipe] 135 springs to flush 
		down, 135 springs ...
		[the boat sinks, hits the springs, and bounces to 
		the surface again]

% Later, the police arrive in a rescue helicopter, and use a harness
% to carry everyone off the boat.  Wiggum complains that there's not a
% looker in the bunch.  Bart and Abe share the last harness off the
% ship.

Abe:	So you working tomorrow at the home, Bart?
Bart:	Well, I finished my community service.
Abe:	[disappointed] Oh, right.
Bart:	But I could swing by after school.  I'll bring the limbo 
	stick.
Abe:	[hums a limbo tune, swaying in time to his music] 
Bart:	Hey, stop shaking the harness!
Abe:	How low can I go?  [off-screen, we hear the sound of 
	splashing as (presumably) Bart hits the water]
