> TV Guide Synopsis

Marge Simpson plays Blanche to Ned Flanders' bare-chested Stanley in
a musical version of ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''

Otto the bus driver, police chief Wiggum and convenience-store owner Apu
are also in the cast.  The director, insolent Llewelyn Sinclair (voice
of Jon Lovitz), has three plays---and three heart attacks---to his credit,
``and I care so much, I'm planning a fourth.''  Until the opening, Maggie
is sent to Springfield's ``only day-care center not currently under
investigation.''  It's run by Sinclair's sister, who confiscates pacifiers.
Maggie and her peers retrieve them in a manner reminiscent of ``The Great
Escape.''

Live from beautiful Laughlin, Nevada, it's the Miss American Girl Pageant!
Brought to you my Meryl Streep's Versatility:  Smell like Streep for Cheep!
I'm your host, Troy McClure!
-- Another slily beauty pageant, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% Homer and the kids watch at home.  (Lisa keeps score on a notepad.)
% Marge leaves the family microwave dinners while she tries out for a part
% in a local musical production of ``A Streetcar Named Desire''.  No one
% pays any attention.

If you ask me, they're all winners!
We'll be cutting our first 40 contestants right after this.
-- Troy McClure hosts the Miss American Girl Pageant,
   ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% Troy introduces the judges, and everyone watches with rapt attention,

Marge: I thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults.
Homer: [eyes fixed on the television set]  Sounds interesting.
Marge: You know, I spend all day home with Maggie.  Sometimes it's
       like I don't even exist.
Homer: [eyes fixed on the television set]  Sounds interesting.
-- Sounds interesting, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% Homer adds his commentary to the selection of the five finalists, while
% Marge warms up her voice by the piano.

Tonight, my reign as Miss American Girl comes to an end, and I'd like to
apologize one last time for my unfortunate remarks at the United Nations.
-- Debra Jo Smallwood, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% Maggie's musical rendition of Tchaikovsky's Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies
% on the toy xylophone is greeted with a ``Maggie, cut that racket!'' from
% Homer.
%
% Homer asks Marge where she's going, insisting that this is the first he's
% heard of her plans to audition.  The kids back him up.
%
% At the Springfield Community Center, the prospective performers in ``Oh!
% Streetcar!'' warm up.  Among the auditioners are Chief Wiggum, Jasper,
% and Ned Flanders, who mentions that he has once already performed in
% ``A Streetcar Named Desire''---as Blanche DuBois.  (That's what happens
% when you go to an all-male school.)
%
% Enter Llewelyn Sinclair.

I have directed three plays in my career, and I have had three heart attacks.
That's how much I care, I'm planning a fourth.
-- Llewelyn Sinclair, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

Marge:  Maybe I should've a nice calligraphy class.
Wiggum: Oh, forget about it.  That Mr. Takahashi's a lunatic!
-- ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

I am not an easy man to work for.  While directing ``Hats off to Channukah'',
I reduced more than one cast member to tears.  Did I expect too much from
fourth-graders?  The review [holds up a school newspaper] ``Play enjoyed by
all'' speaks for itself.
-- Llewelyn Sinclair, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% First order of business is for all men auditioning for the part of Stanley
% to remove their shirts.  Mr. Sinclair rejects most of the auditioners
% out of hand, leaving Ned's muscular physique as the winning candidate.
%
% Mr. Sinclair cuts off all the auditions for the r\^ole of Blanche before
% any of the women can complete their first phrase.  (Marge is interrupted
% in the middle of her first word.)  While he fumes that no one is qualified
% for the part, Marge is on the pay phone, conceding, ``You were right.
% Outside interests are stupid.''  Sinclair overhears the conversation and
% he makes his choice.  He grabs the phone and yells into the receiver,
% ``Stop bothering my Blanche!''
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 5:09]
%
% At the breakfast table, Marge relates the good news.

Wow!  My mother the actress.  I feel like Lucy Arnaz-[something].
-- Lisa, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

Bart:  Are there any jive-talking robots in this play?
Marge: Mm, I don't think so.
Homer: Bart, don't ask stupid questions.
       [to Marge]  Is there any frontal nudity?
-- How about nude jive-talking robots?  ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% At the first rehearsal, the players introduce themselves.  Helen Lovejoy
% plays Stella, Apu as Steve, Otto as Pablo...

Lionel Hutz, Attorney at Law.  I'm filing a class-action suit against the
director on behalf of everyone who was cut from the play.  I also play Mitch!
-- Conflict of interest?  ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% Marge has a tray of peanut-butter brownies for all.
%
% Ned and Marge rehearse a scene where Stanley attempts to ravish Blanche.
% During the scene, Maggie grabs Ned's glasses and peers through them.
% The scene is adorable.  Notes Ned, ``Isn't that cute.  Me without a camera.''
% Annoyed by the interruption, Sinclair gives Marge the address of a day-care
% center run by his sister.
%
% At the Ayn Rand School for Tots, Marge summarizes Maggie's needs, but
% Ms. Sinclair has her own strict views on how babies should be treated.
% (``Our aim here is to develop the bottle within.'')

Mrs. Simpson, I don't like to toot my own horn, but we're the only day-care
in town that is not currently under investigation by the state.
-- Ms. Sinclair, administrator of the Ayn Rand School for Tots,
   ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% Marge leaves Maggie in Ms. Sinclair's care, and the first order of business
% is to confiscate the pacifier.  Maggie watches glumly as her pacifier is
% played inside a locker.
%
% At rehearsal, Marge can't muster the raw hatred needed for the broken bottle
% scene.  (Indeed, she can't even break the bottle.)  Sinclair gives up in
% despair.
%
% Homer plays a hand-held Bowling 2000 video game but manages to get a 7-10
% split.  He is hardly willing to help Marge run her lines.
%
% At the day-care, Maggie looks up longingly at the locker.  She sits down
% and sucks her thumb.  Not satisfied, she tries various other nearby objects,
% including a crayon, a block, and a Bart Simpson doll.
%
% Nap time.  Maggie crawls beneath the cots, tapping each baby as she goes
% by as an invitation to join her.  On her cue, they stack all the toys
% in the room, which indeed reach to the locker, and although Maggie can
% squeeze her tiny arm through the slats, the pacifier itself won't fit.
% The scaffolding collapses, leaving Maggie suspended in air, the pacifier
% in her mouth her only support.  Eventually, she falls.  Alerted by the
% noise, Ms. Sinclair comes in and finds Maggie out of her cot.  ``We have
% a place for babies like you:  The box!''  As Maggie is carted away, one
% of her fellow co-conspirators tosses her a ball.
%
% At rehearsal, Marge still can't muster the harted for the bottle scene.

I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face.
Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle good humor?
-- Marge Simpson has difficulty getting into character,
   ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% Homer arrives to pick up Marge, but Marge asks for a little while longer.
% Marge doesn't see what's so bad about Stanley, while Homer in the background
% performs a flying tackle of a recalcitrant candy vending machine.  Homer
% goes to the car and honks the horn.  ``Marge!  Move it or lose it!''  Marge's
% eyebrows furrow as she envisions Homer, not Ned, as her tormentor.  The
% hatred is there, and it takes Ned by surprise.  ``Ned, you're supposed to
% overpower her.''  ``I'm trying, I'm trying!''
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 10:46]
%
% Dinner.

Salt me.
-- Homer, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% Marge passes the salt with a Southern accent, in preparation for the
% premi\`ere the following evening.  Lisa offers to help by speaking in
% a Southern accent of her own, and Bart joins in with a ``Bob's your
% uncle, Mate.''  Marge leaves to rehearse with Ned.

Homer: What about dessert?
Marge: For God's sakes, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!
Homer: Fine!  I will!
-- That'll show 'er, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% The pull-tab breaks off, leaving Homer's pudding trapped inside forever.
% Homer goes below Ned's window and shouts, ``Maaaaaaaarge!''
%
% Ned's chest is bandaged from a too-realistic-for-the-stage bottle scene,
% as Marge mutters, ``Keep yelling, you big ape.''  Marge angrily smashes
% a bottle and offers to rehears the bottle scene again.
%
% In bed, Homer asks when the play starts, not so much out of genuine
% interest, but rather familial duty.

Marge: I'm sure you won't enjoy it.
       There's nothing about bowling in the play.
       Oh wait, there is.
Homer: Probably not much of it.
-- Enough to placate the special interests, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

Marge: Why can't you be more supportive?
Homer: Because I don't care.
-- Ask a question, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

Homer: I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an
       interest in your kooky projects.
Marge: What kooky projects?
Homer: You know, the painting class, the first aid course,
       the whole Lamaze thing.
-- ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% When Marge asks why he never mentioned this before, Homer explains, ``You
% know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings,'' then promptly
% falls asleep.
%
% At the Ayn Rand School, Maggie leads another covert operation.  Through a
% series of ingenious and resourceful tricks too brilliant to describe, Maggie
% manages to sneak into Ms. Sinclair's office...

If I break, buy a new one!
-- The talking Krusty doll, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% ... grab the keys to the locker, then swing over to the locker and set
% free all of the pacifiers therein.  This kid has real talent.
%
% Homer brings Bart and Lisa along to pick up Maggie, but finds a room full
% of babies sucking on pacifiers in an otherwise eerie silence.  He locates
% Maggie and tiptoes out.
%
% Llewelyn Sinclair gives one last pep talk before the curtain rises.  Chief
% Wiggum introduces the opening number, and the musical proceeds.  The
% rhymes in the lyrics prove challenging.  Homer is bored until Marge's
% entrance, after which his attention remains fixed.  In a later scene,
% Marge floats in anguish around the stage surrounded by red fog and lasers.

Cool, she can fly!
-- Bart, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% Lisa explains that it's supposed to represent her descent into madness.
% Blanche's final line, ``I have always relied on the kindness of strangers,''
% is the cue for the cheery final number, which concludes with ``A stranger's
% just a friend you haven't met.''  The curtain calls are taken, but Marge's
% smile vanishes when she sees Homer's drooped head in the audience.
%
% Backstage, Lisa propels Bart across the stage in the rope rigging used in
% the madness scene.

Hey, look at me!  I'm Blanche DuBois!
-- Bart, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% At Marge's entrance, Lisa lets go of the rope, and Bart lands with a thud,
% no worse for the wear.  Homer sends the kids ahead into the car while he
% talks with Marge.  Marge is upset that Homer didn't even have the courtesy
% to keep his head upright through the performance, but Homer explains that
% he wasn't bored; he was sad.

Homer: It really got to me how that lady, uh...  You know which one I mean.
       You played her.
Marge: Blanche!
Homer: Yeah.
-- Interactive Cliff's Notes, ``A Streetcar Named Marge''

% He continues, ``The poor thing gets hauled to the nuthouse when all she
% needed was for that big slob to show her some respect.''  At least, that's
% his interpretation of events.
%
% Outside, Homer notes, ``Hey, I'm a lot like that guy.''  Marge concedes,
% ``Well, maybe just a little,'' and gives him a kiss.

>>>> The opening number

    . Long before the Superdome,
    . Where the Saints of football play,
    . There's a city where the damned call home,
    . Hear their hellish rondelet:
    .
    . New Orleans!
    . Home of pirates, drunks, and whores...
    . New Orleans!
    . Tacky, overpriced souvenir stores...
    .
    . If you want to go to hell, you should take a trip
    . To the Sodom and Gomorrah of the Mississip':
    .
    . New Orleans!
    . Stinking, rotten, vomiting, vile...
    . New Orleans!
    . Putrid, frackish[?], maggoty, foul...
    .
    . New Orleans!
    . Crummy, lousy, wretched, and rank...
    . New Orleans!
    . ...

> Comments and other observations

>> References from the obvious to the obscure

>>> Slender Vittles

Marge's low-cal microwaveable dinner is Krusty Brand Slender Vittles, a
pun on the American cat food Tender Vittles.  (With perhaps additional
help from Simpsons producer Jon ``Tender'' Vitti.)

>>> At Seventeen

The beauty pageant contestants sing the first two lines of Janis Ian's
``At Seventeen'':
\Q
    I learned the truth at seventeen,
    That love was meant for beauty queens
\eQ
They conveniently omit the remainder of the lyrics, graciously provided
here by Leila Johannesen @{lj} and (ah.pbl@forsythe.stanford.edu):
\Q
    And high school girls with clear skin smiles
    Who married young and then retired.

  (chorus)
    We all play the game, and when we dare,
    We cheat ourselves at solitaire,
    Inventing lovers on the phone, repenting of the lies untold (?),
    who call to say come dance with me, and murmur strange obscenities.
    At seventeen...
\eQ
As you can see, it's hardly an upbeat song.  The girls bailed out just in time.

>>> Ayn Rand

J. D. Baldwin@{jdb} explains, for those illiterates among us:
Ayn Rand was a ``philosopher'' who claimed that a complex
system of epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, metaphysics and politics
could be derived from the simple, ``self-evident'' proposition that ``A = A''.
Her philosophical system is widely regarded as ``right-wing'', whatever
that means.

Adam Trotter@{ast} adds that the school's architecture is in the
style of Frank Lloyd Wright, who was the model for Howard Roark, the
protagonist of ``The Fountainhead''.

>> Fallout

The day after the episode's first airing, the producers were compelled to
issue a formal apology to the city of New Orleans.  Apparently, some cities
can't take a joke...
