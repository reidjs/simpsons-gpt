==============================================================================
   [TV Guide] Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States ...
   Lisa Simpson! That's the story in this fanciful glimpse 30 years into the
   future.  The episode begins when Bart encounters a Native American mystic
   (and casino manager) who shows Bart his future -- as a ne'er-do-well
   musician rooming with Ralph Wiggum.  Upon hearing of Lisa's election to the
   Oval Office, Bart heads for the White House, where he mooches, criticizes
   Lisa for no longer being cool and promotes his band during her address to
   the Nation.  Wrestling with a fiscal crises, President Simpsons sends Bart
   to Camp David, ostensibly to help. Meanwhile, Homer searches the White
   House for Lincoln's hidden gold.

Couch:          The couch is part of a discotheque.  There's a mirrored ball
                hanging from the ceiling, and some trendy people sitting on
                the couch, which has a velvet rope in front of it.  The family
                runs up to the bouncer.  He lets in Marge, Maggie, Bart, and
                Lisa, but turns away Homer.

   it became necessary for the joke.)  {bjr}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Wilson Banswell:  Buh!  I guess all flash-forward episodes aren't the same.
   Good points were Ralph and Maggie and Homer.  Bad Points: Why did Bart talk
   like he was 10? Also, why would Flanders ever give Bart money?  I did like
   Rod & Todd.  Wish I had seen more of Springfield.  (C)

Nate Birch:  Like in "Lisa's Wedding" this episode shows us the Simpson's
   future in a fun and interesting way.  Seeing what all the characters would
   turn out like was kind of interesting, and the show was relatively funny
   without being too wacky or unbelievable.  There were some problems, as it
   seems the writers basically decided to forget most of the events from
   Lisa's wedding, and I found the whole "Mystical Indian Casino" thing kind
   of stupid, I mean it's sad when an episode of Simpsons actually rips off
   the Family Guy.  Despite these problems it was a fairly solid episode and
   about on par for season 11.  (B+)

Don Del Grande:  episodes set in the future have so many possibilities, but
   this episode went nowhere.  Bart's a slob -- Lisa is President -- Bart
   messes things up for Lisa -- Homer does something stupid -- Lisa sends Bart
   off somewhere -- Bart comes back to save Lisa's butt -- end of story.  Why
   not something different, like having Maggie's daughter speak?  (B-)

Nicholas Di Canada:  this episode needs not to be compared to "Lisa's
   Wedding," which is a hard episode to reprise.  This is difficult not only
   because of the basic idea, but also because of some similar situations in
   both episodes.  "Bart to the Future" itself is entertaining, particularly
   the President Lisa thing, which I didn't think it could work.  I laughed
   frequently with this episode, and that doesn't happen too much lately.  If
   you expect another "Lisa's Wedding" the grade would not be higher than a D.
   If you try to overlook it (which is what I tried to do) then the grade goes
   up to a  (B)

Mike Erickson:  This is probably the best episode since DAS BUS ... maybe even
   THE SECRET WAR OF LISA SIMPSON (almost 3 years ago)  Wonderful
   characterization of Bart in the future (he looked a lot better than in
   LISA'S WEDDING)  This is a solid A episode ... good job!  (A)

Carl Johnson:  "Bart to the Future" gets worse the more you think about it.
   It's always nice to see a story where things make sense, that which could
   be acted out by real people without much trouble, but, even here, plenty of
   story elements make no sense.  There are several good jokes, but
   unfortunately not much pertaining what America is like in 2035.  A welcome
   sojourn into reality, but that aside, BABF13 is mediocre in every way.
   (C+)

Darrel C. Jones:  Not a classic, by any means, but still a worthy successor to
   "Lisa's Wedding".  The method of the vision (Bart meeting an American
   Indian) was much more innovative than [2F15]'s was.  It's also nice to see
   Lisa does, in fact, have a future.  The opening scene with the mosquitoes
   was (IMO) funny, but many will not care for its slapstick nature.  Most of
   this was LOL hilarious.  I give it an 8/10  (A-)

Andrew Levine:  Okay, let's see if I can get through this without drawing a
   single comparison to "Lisa's Wedding," as I know EVERYONE else will do.
   With that out of the way, there's more human drama at play here than in
   most recent episodes, even if it is simplified and mostly dumbed down by a
   pretty one-dimensional characterization of Bart.  Lisa was much better --
   she behaved much like I'd expect her to do if she was President.  I think
   we're past the point where we need a frame story, though; I'd rather have
   just had a title card and jumped right into things.  The humor was mostly
   thin and predictable (although I liked the numerous FFF), but the plot was
   more or less coherent.  Overall a little above average.  (B)

Troy Mathews:  I thoroughly enjoyed this episode tonight.  The sibling rivalry
   between Bart and Lisa even continues into the future as well.  And to add
   to that, it is nice to see them work together as they always do at the end.
   I wish I could have seen the grown up Maggie.  But overall, I give it a
   grade of  (A-)

Lance Mulhern:  I'm reminded of Bart Simpson's line in 3F02; "I know that's
   funny, but I'm just not laughing."  From the parade sneaking off, to the
   "Lincoln's Gold" gag, and all the way back to "You put an ad in MY
   vision?", I thought that the lines were funny.  But they just didn't cause
   me to laugh.  I think the writers put effort into it, but it just didn't
   work.  Was it just me?  Didn't make me LOL, but it did make me smile a
   couple of times.  (D+)

Abhi Ray:  Terrible.  This episode was so devoid of any originality and
   creativity, it's amazing.  Lisa as president was not funny, nor was it in
   the least bit creative. All that happens is Lisa worrying about the budget.
   Does anyone care?  No. There's absolutely no insight or thought into the
   society or culture of the future.  There's no delight or pity or any
   feeling into what the characters turn into.  I don't know why this episode
   was made, other than telling a ho-hum, absolutely worthless story of Bart
   mooching off Lisa and then helping her.  (D-)

Eli Rosenbaum:  That was not an episode of The Simpsons.  That was an episode
   of Futurama.  The humor was utterly not subtle, the pacing was off, and the
   future references, from Soylent Green (what was up with THAT??) to the
   rings around the Washington Monument (please) were too much like Futurama's
   lame gizmos than classic Simpsons satire.  Now, I have no problem with OFF
   tackling a concept twice (it's worked with alcohol satire, Sideshow Bob,
   etc.), but why go over the same ground again having nothing to say?  Give
   me "Lisa's Wedding" any day.  (C-)

Jason Rosenbaum:  For the past 4 years, I have coveted Homerpalooza as the
   worst episode ever. Tonight, that episode has been dethroned by "Bart To
   The Future," the most astoundingly pitiful episode of the Simpsons in its
   illustrious 11 year history.  Why you ask?  Not only was a complete copy of
   the great "Lisa's Wedding," it contained almost no laughs, a profoundly
   inept plot (Bart mooches off President Lisa.  Who cares?!?!?) and a
   vomit-inducing ending.  This is an abomination to what otherwise is a good
   season.  (F)

Jessy Scholl:  When you compare this episode with "Lisa's Wedding,"  this
   episode was a little better for me.  Despite a so-so first act, the episode
   really picked up when Lisa became president.  Bart's behavior during Lisa's
   speech was very funny.  I liked the way Bart uncovered her lie so very
   much.  Another highlight was the search for Lincoln's Gold, and how Bart
   got the foreign leaders to think that America paid its bills.  (B+)

Todd Willis:  This an abundance of future related jokes that usually were
   right on target, but again it was another episode that succumbed to having
   too thin of a story line.  The first act was probably the best because of
   its future related jokes (I like the Soylent Green reference), and its
   portrayal of the Indian casino (Gabbo is still around).  The second act was
   a nice, but not as good, follow up to the first act.  Act three totally
   bombed.  I'll give the Simpsons the benefit of the doubt and give them
   credit for some good jokes over the weak story line.  (B)

Robert Wisham:  I liked seeing Gabbo again, but didn't care for the framing
   sequence very much.  Bart's voice was annoying, and I couldn't believe the
   Maggie astronaut scene wasn't there.  Lisa as President had a lot of
   potential we didn't see.  Oh well.  (C+)

Yours Truly:  Since this episode focuses on Bart, it's a good thing that
   future-Bart is interesting as an aimless musician who, in spite of his
   frankly immature ways, is also likeable, just as the present-day Bart is.
   Unfortunately, Bart is almost the *only* interesting character in the
   future, with most of the others being either bland, or just older-looking
   versions of their present-day selves.  At least the animators did a good
   job of making future-everyone *visually* interesting.  "Bart to the Future"
   also no scene that packs the emotional wallop of Lisa's near-wedding in
   "Lisa's Wedding (2F15)."  That episode was one of my favorites, and I don't
   predict that another one will be knocking it off its perch anytime soon.
   (B-)

Joe Green:  During Lisa's address, Bart sings a song to the tune of Rupert
   Holmes' "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)".


>> Meta-reference corner

Benjamin Robinson:  Bart wonders why his vision had a sub-plot, and his spirit
   guide suggests it was because the main plot was too thin.


>> Car Watch 2030

Benjamin Robinson:  There's a yellow VW Old Beetle in the casino parking lot.
   It can be seen as Mr. Crandall carries Bart from his truck.


>> Now with more girls!

Joe Klemm:  For those who missed it in earlier capsule submissions here's the
   lowdown on Soylent Green: Soylent Green is a 1973 film starring NRA head
   Charleston Heston. The film is set in the 21st Century, where an
   overpopulated Earth is eating a substance called Soylent Green.  By the end
   of the film, it is discovered that Soylent Green is actually made from
   people.  End of story.


>> Futurepolitik

Benjamin Robinson:  Lisa blames her predecessor, President Trump, for the
   budget crisis. Doubtlessly, she is referring to Donald Trump, a self-made
   real estate mogul and first-rate egomaniac.  He publicly flirted with the
   idea of running under the Reform Party ticket this year, although most
   observers felt this was just a publicity stunt to promote his casino
   ventures.  Or, perhaps just to promote *him*.  Trump isn't known for being
   a tightwad, so it's easy to imagine him spending the country into a serious
   debt.

   Billy Carter was Jimmy's ne'er-do-well brother and national punchline. He's
   best known for "Billy Beer," a brew marketed under his name, and for
   getting in some sort of scandal with the Libyans.


Bill Franklin adds:  Once it was revealed that he was recovering alcoholic, it
   wasn't that funny any more.  Collectors were also hit hard.  They bought a
   lot, thinking it would be valuable one day, but alas, they bought too much.
   Now at Beer conventions, it is given away as door prizes.


Benjamin Robinson:  Chastity Bono is Sonny and Cher Bono's daughter.  Sonny,
   of course, was a member of Congress in his post-showbiz days, so this might
   be a political dynasty in the making, like the Kennedys.  I believe Ms.
   Bono is currently an activist for gay rights.


>> The Making of the President:  2030

Speaking of future politics, here's what Joey Joe Joe Junior Shabadoo has to
   say about the prospects of a Lisa Simpson presidency:  It is now some time
   after the fact, but I was thinking about "Bart to the Future" the other day
   and something came to mind.  For a show that used to pride itself on satire
   and cynicism, do you think the writers were a bit naive to think that Lisa
   could ever get elected President, even thirty years from now?  Lets look at
   some facts about Lisa that would make her electoral poison:

   - She has very liberal political views.

   - She is not afraid to speak her mind.

   - She is not religious.  (Polls show that the vast majority of Americans
   would not vote for an atheist)  [Tom Hawley notes, "If she slammed Homer
   for not going to church in Homer the Heretic she must have some religious
   stance."]

   - She is from a working class background.

   - She is not a member of a privileged, high standing family or of any
   secret societies.

   - She is female.

   - She is pro gun control.

   - She is a strong environmentalist.

   Even allowing for some degree of social change in the next couple of
   decades, there are just too many strikes against her that would prevent
   John Q. Average Voter (or the corporate interests that really elect the
   President, according to the cynic in me :-) ) from voting for her.  I would
   think a better idea for the episode would have been to have it take place
   during Lisa's campaign, in which her strong convictions and character
   (along with Bart's antics) cost her the election.  As far as I'm concerned,
   it beats Homer digging up the White House looking for treasure.  But then
   again, I guess that's why I'm not a writer.


Lee Ratner:  I don't think class would be that important.  Our best president,
   Abraham Lincoln, was born into a family very low on the social scale. Bill
   Clinton while only on okay President comes from the working class as well.


Arup Baral answers:  However in recent politics, a president with a truly
   working class background is practically non existent.  The one exception is
   Jimmy Carter.


>> In this red corner:  Pakistan.  In the blue corner:  India.

While we're on the subject of the politics of the future, Benjamin Robinson
   writes:  When India regained its independence in 1947, it was hoped the
   nation's Muslim and Hindu factions would be unite and run the country
   together.  ["Hoped by Gandhi and three or four other people, maybe," says
   Seth Miller.]  No such luck -- the two factions immediately fought one
   another.  The outcome was the partitioning of India into three.


Not quite, according to Seth Miller:  That's not true, it was partitioned into
   two countries, India and Pakistan; Pakistan was not contiguous.  Bangladesh
   (the portion of Pakistan that was known as EAST Pakistan) sought and gained
   independence from the wealthier and dominant West years later (I think the
   seventies but I am too drunk to look it up.)


Benjamin Robinson continues:  Even with both sides separated, the hostilities
   continued.  Events recently took a disturbing turn when both countries
   developed a nuclear strike capability, raising the specter of at least a
   regional nuclear war.


>> Now that "Eat My Shorts" is passe

Jerry P. figures Bart is destined to move on to new sayings:  Future Bart seems
   to have new catch phrases

   - "Relax, you'll live longer."  Said to Lisa and the ambassadors.

   - "mooch"  He hasn't said this before.

   - "What happened to you?  You used to be cool."  Said to Homer, Lisa and
   China.

   - "Keeping it real"

   - "-ski"  Bart says "loanski" and "tuneskis".

   - "dude"  He seems to say this more than usual.


>> Kahn Souphanousinphone on "The Simpsons?"

Alec Soroudi asks:  Hi, I just saw the 'Bart to the Future' episode again and
   again I thought that the Chinese ambassador sounded a lot like Kahn from
   King of the Hill.  Anyone else think so?  I don't think it was, Toby Huss
   was not listed in the credits.  Simpsons doesn't usually leave a person
   uncredited.  It was probably one of the other regulars, but it just sounded
   a LOT like Khan.  It's just that the voice was the same but so were the
   subtle inflections and mannerisms.  "You pay now!, You pay later!" just the
   way Khan would say it.  :)  Except that he was Chinese and Khan is Laotian
   La-O-tian!  :)


Ryan Mead adds:  One of the realtors from "Realty Bites" sounded like Mihn,
   FWIW.


>> Legalize *what*?

Toward the end of Bart's vision, the Bart of the future asked President Lisa
   to legalize ... it.  What "it" is, Bart never says, although Lisa seems to
   catch on pretty quickly.  Out there in TV land, the viewers came up with
   some pretty creative solutions.


Troy Matthews, speaking for many, suggested:  I think most people that watched
   tonight's episode were assuming that Bart wanted to "legalize" marijuana.
   I guess he would have that classic image have that person that maybe smokes
   pot.  Although I would have to say this type analyst is crude to draw a
   conclusion from.


Mike Perry:  IMHO this episode contains be-all-end-all proof that Bart is gay.
   The "legalize it" line was good enough for me.  As I mentioned in my other
   post, it could refer to anything, but Bart has quite a history behind him
   with that sort of thing.  Plus, Flanders thanked him for not coming out
   about his boys (who were OBVIOUSLY gay).  It seems to me that being gay
   would give him reason not to try to embarrass the Flanders.

   I'm sure everyone's noticed Bart's flamboyant tendencies in the past, so
   the first thing that sprang to mind was gay marriage.  But Ralph Wiggum?
   Nah ...

   Of course, he could be talking about anything, drugs, prostitution, etc.
   But given his history ... ("These knots are just impossible ... Well they
   are..", "Where'd you get that shirt?"  "Came out of the closet", "Looks
   like he's gotten into the pep closet again" "I'd say he's coming out of the
   pep closet. heh heh.  Ohh" :)


David Levy:  Personally, I took it as a reference to prostitution.  He may
   have been referring to marijuana, but I don't think so.


"Scan":  Bart in "Lisa's Wedding" was into strippers so maybe he has become
   such  a loser that he can only get prostitutes to have sex with him and
   wanted that legalized.  I think when he go "it" legalized, the justices and
   congressmen were so grateful that  he was a shoo-in for the Supreme Court.

   [Mr. Scan also notes that "Legalize It" is a pro-marijuana song by Peter
   Tosh.  "Ratboy" Dave points out that it is the slogan of NORML, an
   organization that supports legalizing marijuana -- Ed.]


Matt O.:  it has to do with the the criminalization of putting squirrels down
   one's pants ...


Reagen Sulewski:  Only if you're gambling on it.


Keith Connor:  He wanted to make it legal for ducks NOT to wear long pants in
   public ...


"S. R.":  They did this just to get people wondering ... In other words, it
   doesn't refer to anything, but they knew that viewers would have to come up
   with something ... So now the Simpsons people are reading these posts and
   laughing at us because of all the ridiculous ideas we're coming up with,
   when it actually means nothing.


Andrew Krupowicz:  Perhaps this time it was the obvious answer, not obviously
   stated, so it could drive you insane.  Bit by bit.  Breaking down daily,
   until you're beyond hope, eh?


>> This is ground control to Space Maggie ... come in, Space Maggie ...

As we've seen, Fox's promotions of "The Simpsons" don't always reflect what
   actually airs Sunday night.  That definitely holds true for "Bart to the
   Future."


Benjamin Robinson:  The ads for this episode included a brief shot of Maggie,
   as an adult, wearing a spacesuit.  The suit had a breathing device that
   resembled a pacifier, which Maggie sucked on in the usual way.  Her hair
   was less wild than we saw in "Lisa's Wedding."  Hope you got a good look,
   because this shot wasn't included in the actual episode.  Maybe it's just
   as well -- I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of a space Maggie, anyway.


T. P. Liang shows us the irony in this situation:  On the cutting room floor:
   In the commercials for Bart to the future, a scene featuring Maggie Sr. on
   the moon was cut.(you could see the scene during the "on next" screen!)


Troy Matthews quotes our very own Simpsons Archive on this matter:  Each
   episode is produced with extra and alternate animation, to allow the
   directors the freedom to decide just what will and won't work, up until a
   few days before a show goes to air.  Fox has access to the footage before
   the final cuts are made, and so it's not unusual for extra material to
   materialize during the promotions.

   Also, the Fox network has taken to mixing clips from previous episodes with
   clips from upcoming episodes, supposedly to make episodes more enticing or
   exciting.  The best example of this is the commercial for "The Itchy and
   Scratchy and Poochie Show" in which Homer's character Poochie is on TV and
   Lisa says "The network has sunk to a new low," the footage coming from 9F22
   "Cape Feare."


D. W. III suspects the truth is not so pat, however:  Conspiracy Hypothesis:
   That particular part of the promo may have been nothing more than an
   insidious plot by the writers to keep the unsuspecting viewers from tuning
   out during the episode.

   Worked for me ... (D'oh!)


>> Why we're not counting most continuity errors

Jeremy Friesen explains:  The episode was a "vision of the future", not the
   actual "future".  Continuologists need not concern themselves with this
   episode. Or if they do, they might as well also pick apart the continuity
   of the Halloween episodes.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Andrew Levine alterna-title for this episode is:  "21st Century Wasteoid
   Man"


Jake Lennington suggests:  "All the President's Moochin' Men"


Benjamin Robinson contributes these two items:  DeVry Institute is a
   commercial trade school specializing in technical subjects such as
   drafting.

   "Hustler" is Larry Flynt's notorious porno magazine.  Notice that it's
   right next door to the White House.  I'll bet Clinton lobbied to have it
   built there.

Folks, you're going to want to turn around.  The bugs are firmly in 
charge.
-- Park ranger, "Bart to the Future"

% Homer grudgingly turns around the car.  A swarm of bugs engulfs the
% rangers hand and, when it disperses, the ranger's class ring is
% missing.  After he complains, the swarm returns to deposit the ring
% -- and then takes the flesh of his hand.
%
% Bart spots an Indian gaming casino, and Homer quickly pulls into its
% parking lot.  Marge doesn't think this little detour is a good idea.

Homer:	Let's go, Marge.  Come on, come on, come on!
Marge:	Homer, you know I have a gambling problem.
Homer:	Well, what better place to celebrate your recovery than 
amidst the frenzied excitement of the casino floor.
Marge:	Hrrmph.
-- "Bart to the Future"

% Homer and Bart run off to join the casino floor's frenzied
% excitement.  A bouncer stops Bart at the door.

Bouncer:	No minors.
Bart:		Yeah, but I really want --
Homer:		Sorry, son.  Although they seem strange to us, we must 
		respect the ways of the Indian.
-- "Bart to the Future"

% Ever respectful, Homer walks into the main greeting hall, repeating
% "Hi-how-are-you" in the rhythm of a stereotypical war chant.
%
% Meanwhile, Bart is as determined as ever to get into the casino. 
% Looking around, he notices Arthur Crandall talking to one of the
% casino's security people at the back door.  Crandall, unseen since
% "The Gabbo Show" folded, has fallen on hard times.  He tries to
% negotiate a free night's stay from the casino, but is forced to
% settle for a free trip to the pasta bar.  Bart sneaks onto
% Crandall's truck and climbs into Gabbo's carrying case.  Other than
% the fact the case now weighs much more, Crandall notices nothing
% amiss as he takes the it backstage.
%
% Onstage, Crandall opens the case before his audience.  To everyone's
% surprise -- especially Crandall's -- Bart hops out of the case. 
% Casino security men quickly capture him and take him to the
% manager's office.

Manager:	[on phone] Your linen service has broken many 
		promises to us.  Laundry bill soar like eagle.  
		[hangs up] Jerk.
		[walks over to Bart] So, you like to sneak into 
		casinos?
Bart:		I wasn't going to gamble.  I just wanted a Bloody 
		Mary.
Manager:	Listen to me.  Unless you change your deceitful 
		ways.  I foresee a life bitterness and failure for 
		you, Bart Simpson.
Bart:		How'd you know my name?
Manager:	[holds up a legal document] Your father just took 
		out a second mortgage downstairs.  You're listed as 
		collateral.
Bart:		Oh.  I thought that maybe you were some kind of 
		Indian mystic who could tell the future?
Manager:	Who says I'm not?
-- Insert "Twilight Zone" theme here, "Bart to the Future"

% A fire flares up from a hearth in the office's center, startling
% Bart.

Manager:	If you want to see the future, throw a treasured 
		personal item onto the fire.
		[Bart tosses a small object, which explodes with a 
		bang]
		Not a firecracker!
Bart:		Hey, I bought it from a guy on your reservation.
Manager:	That's Crazy Talk.
Bart:		No, it's true.
Manager:	No, I know, that's my brother, Crazy Talk.  We're 
		all a little worried about him.
-- Even Dances with Sock Puppets is concerned, "Bart to the Future"

% The manager invites Bart to look deep into the flames, to see what 
% lies in store thirty years from now.  Bart, and the audience, sees a
% vision of the boy as he will be in 2030.  Future-Bart's hair has
% grown a bit scraggly, and he has tied some of it into a pony tail. 
% A Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and sandals complete the "dressed down"
% look.  He has inherited his father's physique, pot belly and all,
% something that was no doubt aided by many cans of Future Duff.  He
% takes a sip from one such can, and burps loudly.
%
% Bart picks up a guitar and begins to tune it.

Bart:	[strumming the guitar] Check, check.  Hello, Capital City.  
	[one of the strings breaks] Way to make a guitar, Sears.
Ralph:	[walks in, dripping wet and without clothes] Hey, Bart, 
	any clean towels?
Bart:	Nah.  Use this.  [tosses Ralph a newspaper]
Ralph:	I'm sick of having to dry myself with a newspaper.  You 
	could at least do some laundry.  I pay the rent.  [ties 
	the paper around his waist, like a towel]
Bart:	Dude, you know I'm good for it.  I'll have plenty of money 
	when my lawsuit pays off.
Ralph:	You mean the spider bite at Disneyland?
Bart:	Or the incident with the over-salted fries.
-- "Bart to the Future"

% There's a knock at the door -- it's a Holo-gram for Bart, from
% Nelson.  He grants Bart's band permission to play at his club,
% albeit for a salary of popcorn shrimp.  He signs off with the
% future's customary way of saying good-bye:  "Smell you later."
%
% Bart's band has a gig, but his amp's in hock.  He figures he can
% borrow some money from his folks, so it's time for a trip to
% Springfield, via non-hover-bus.
%
% Back at Bart's boyhood home, Homer and Marge try Virtual Fudge, but
% find it lacking in comparison to Cyber-Fudge.  Bart and Ralph
% arrive.

Bart:	Yo, it's me!
Homer:	[takes the Virtual Fudge wire out of his mouth, which 
	shocks him] Oh, what a bleak and horrible future we live 
	in!
Bart:	Don't you mean, "present?"
Homer:	Right, right, present.  Anyway, can I get you some Soylent 
Green.  [holds up a box of it]
Ralph:	Isn't that made of people?
Homer:	Uh, oh, here we go ...
Bart:	Hey, Dad, my band finally got a break.  I just need a 
	little moolah to get my amp out of hock.  How about a 
	little loan-ski?
Homer:	Oh, I'm tired of giving you money.  Why can't you be more 
	like Lisa?
Bart:	I am so sick of hearing about Lisa.  Just because she's 
	doing a little better than me --
Marge:	She's President of the United States!
Bart:	President-*elect*.
-- Oh, is that all?  "Bart to the Future"

% Bart says that he, too, could be President if he wasn't so "real." 
% That doesn't impress Homer enough to pry any cash from him, so he
% leaves.

Bart:	What happened to you, man?  You used to be cool.
Homer:	I'm still cool!
Bart:	Nah, you've changed, man.
Homer:	Well, I do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see 
	it.  [glances downward] Oh, you can.
-- He's a real machine, "Bart to the Future"

% Bart tries his luck with the neighbors.

Bart:	[rings bell] Flanders is a soft touch.  He'll give us the

	[Ned answers the door.  He's wearing dark glasses and 
	carrying a cane]
Ned:	Jesus?  Is that you?
Ralph:	Mr. Flanders, you're blinded-ded!
Ned:	Oh, yeah.  I never should have had that trendy laser 
	surgery.  It was great at first but, you know, at the ten-
	year mark your eyes fall out.
Bart:	Listen, dude --
Ned:	Oh-ho, hi, Bart.  How much this time?  [reaches for his 
	wallet]
Bart:	Dude, you got me all wrong.
Ned:	Yeah.  Just answer me this:  Are you holding your mooching 
	sack?
Bart:	[holds up a small bag with a dollar sign on it]
	My little one.
Ned:	Bart, you're never going to grow up if I keep bailing you 
	out.
Bart:	Then, please, help me help myself.
Ned:	Oh, all right, but only because you haven't outed Rod and 
	Todd.  [camera pulls back to reveal the boys, grown up and

-- "Bart to the Future"

% Bart and Ralph get to play their gig at Nelson's Crab Shack, but it
% doesn't well.  Jimmy Buffet charges royalties, so Bart plays one of
% his "originals," which is just a thinly-disguised version of
% "Margaritaville."  Only a grid of lasers keeps the boys from being
% pelted with beer bottles, and even that is starting to buckle from
% the strain.
%
% The non-hover bus drops Ralph and Bart at the house they've been
% renting.  They find an eviction notice on the door.

Bart:		Oh, no, I've got half a beer in there -- and 
		"Bewitched" is on.
Ralph:		Now we've got no home, no money, and our band's 
		going nowhere, and it's all your fault.  Smell you 
		later, Bart.  Smell you later forever!  [walks off]
Bart:		Oh, he's right.  I'm a loser.  There's only one way 
		out of this mess.  [slumps down on the porch, and 
		points what looks like a laser pistol at his head.  
		He pulls the trigger, but instead of a laser, he

Brockman:	From around the globe to your frontal lobe, this is

Bart:		Damn, I was so close -- I had 3-2-7.
Brockman:	In other news, President-elect Lisa Simpson moves

Lisa:		As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch 
		from President Trump.  How bad is it Secretary Van 
		Houten?
Milhouse:	[shows to a chart] We're broke.
Lisa:		The country is broke?  How can that be?
Milhouse:	Well, remember when the last administration decided 
		to invest in our nation's children?  Big mistake.
Aide:		The balanced breakfast program just created a 
		generation of ultra-strong super-criminals.
Milhouse:	And midnight basketball taught them to function 
		without sleep.
Lisa:		What about my pledge to build the world's largest 
		bookmobile?  Isn't there any money left for that?
Aide:		No, and we've borrowed from every country in the 
		world.
		[without warning, Bart bursts into the room]
Bart:		Hey, Lisa, call off your -- [two Secret Service 
		agents jump him] Ow!  Watch the ponytail.
Lisa:		Let him up, please.  [the agents do so]
		What are you doing here?
Bart:		I knew you'd need some help keeping it real, so I

Bart:		Mom!  Lisa won't share!
Marge:		Be nice to your brother, Lisa.

Lisa:	Appointed a Supreme Court justice.
Marge:	Oh.

-- That's why Nixon spent so little time there, "Bart to the Future"

% Bart's "coolness committee" convenes at Camp David.  Krusty suggests
% starting the report off with a joke, and tells one about the nuclear
% conflict between India and Pakistan.  It bombs, if you'll pardon the
% pun.  Bart tells the group that if they buckle down now, they can go
% through President Clinton's porno stash when they're done.  The gang
% decides not to wait, and Bart goes by himself to the bar to work on
% the report.

Bart:		Oh, Lisa's counting on me for this coolness report.
Carter:		Coolness report?  Huh.  You've been had, boy.
Bart:		Billy Carter's ghost?
Carter:		Damn straight.  And I'm here to tell you, you've 
		been sent on a wild goose chase.
Bart:		You mean Lisa wanted to get rid of me?
Carter:		Well, that's a big ten-four.  When my brother Jimmy 
		was making peace in the Middle East, he sent me to 
		belly-flop academy.
Bart:		I guess I am an embarrassment.
Carter:		You sure are.  And hey, there's an embarrassment of 
		riches at the Caesar's Pow Wow Indian Casino.  You 
		can bet on it!  [winks and fans a deck of cards]
		[cut to the present]
Bart:		You put an ad in my vision?
Manager:	Yeah, Crazy Talk came up with that.  He got idea 
		from Dances With Focus Groups.
-- "Bart to the Future"

% Back to the future, where Homer has dug up a good part of the White
% House lawn.  Finally, he hits paydirt.

Homer:	[hauls a chest from one of the holes] Marge, I did it!  I 
	found Lincoln's gold!
	[opens the chest, but finds only a piece of paper] Huh?
Marge:	[picks up the paper and reads it] Dear Countryman.  You've 
	come in search of my gold, and I will not disappoint you.
Homer:	Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
Marge:	My gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving American.
Homer:	Aw, crap!
Marge:	It's in our mighty rivers, our majestic -- well, isn't 
	that clever?  It's a metaphor.
Homer:	[pounds the earth with his shovel] That lying, rail-
	splitting, theater-going freak!
-- "Honest Abe," my ass, "Bart to the Future"

% The mood in Lisa's meeting room isn't much less hostile.  The
% creditor nations go from wanting to be repaid to calling for Lisa's
% head.  Just when things couldn't get worse, Bart walks in.

Bart:		You guys should relax; you'll live longer.
Lisa:		Bart, you're supposed to be at Camp David.
Bart:		[aside to Lisa] You're meeting with debt collectors 
		and you don't want my help?  Do you know how crazy 
		that is?
		[to the creditors] Guys, the thing is, we totally 
		have the money, and we tried to wire it to you, but 
		you know how banks screw up.
Frenchman:	I do not understand.
Bart:		We tried to call you all day Saturday.
German:		We were there Saturday.
Bart:		Dude, I know.  I left a message with some guy named 
		Hans.
German:		Hans?
Bart:		He might have been a temp.  Very surly.
German:		We have had a lot of turnover.
Chinese Man:	You pay now!  Now!  [pounds fist on table]
Bart:		What happened to you, China?  You used to be cool.
Chinese Man:	Hey, China is still cool.  You pay later.  Later!  
		[pounds fist on table]
Bart:		Solid.  The rest of you go on home, and look in your 
		mailboxes, cause I totally remember sending checks 
		out.
		[murmuring, the creditor nations' representatives 
		leave]
-- Bart Simpson, master negotiator, "Bart to the Future"

% Lisa is grateful for Bart's help.

Lisa:	Thanks, Bart.  You bought us some time.  What can I do to 
	thank you?
Bart:	Legalize it.
Lisa:	Legalize what?
Bart:	[smiles]
Lisa:	[realizes] Ohhh, oh.  Consider it done.
-- And that's how it was legalized, "Bart to the Future"

% Figuring the occasion calls for some music, Bart tries to play a
% cassette on his boom box.  The machine malfunctions and catches
% fire.
%
% Segue to the flames in the manager's office, where the manager says
% the vision gets hazy after that.  Bart wonders why his vision
% includes the story of Homer searching for Lincoln's gold, and the
% manager figures the spirits thought the main vision needed some
% bolstering.  The main point, however, is that Bart can improve his
% fate if he pledges to change his ways.  Bart promises to do so, and
% the manager gives him an (expired) coupon, then disappears in a gust
% of wind.
%
% Lisa walks into the office.

Lisa:	There you are!  Come on, we have to go.  Dad pushed a 
	waitress and Mom lost twenty thousand dollars.
	[cut to a shot of Lisa and Bart walking in the parking 
	lot]
Bart:	You're not going to believe it, Lis.  This cool Indian guy 
	showed me our future.
Lisa:	Really?  Anything good?
Bart:	I'll say!  I've got my own band, and a moped.
Lisa:	What about me?
Bart:	Eh, some government job.
-- She has to live in public housing, too, "Bart to the Future"
