% Homer tucks Bart into bed with a smile.  He then steps back...

H: [mildly annoyed] Now, good night, son.
B: Uh, Dad?
H: What.
B: What is the mind?
   Is it just a system of impulses?
   Or is it something tangible?
H: Relax.  What is mind?  No matter.  What is matter?  Never mind!

% Homer laughs one of his weird laughs you only get to see on the Tracey
% Ullman show.

B: [not entirely convinced]  Thanks, Dad.
H: Good night, son.

% (*click*)  The lights go off, but Bart's eyes remain wide open.
% (They also do weird things.)

M: Sweet dreams.
L: Thanks, Mom.
M: Sleep tight.

L: Bedbugs?

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:39]
%
% Marge tucks Maggie into her crib.

M: [singing]  Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop...

% Maggie imagines herself in a cradle balanced on a tree bough.

M: When the wind blows, the cradle will rock...

% The wind blows Maggie's bow off, rustles her hair, and starts rocking
% the cradle.

M: When the bough breaks...

% The bough breaks...

M:                      ... the cradle will fall...

% It does.  Maggie screams (silently) as the cradle plummets to earth.
% Her pacifier also falls on a parallel course.

M: And down will come baby, cradle and all.

% Zoom in on Maggie's open mouth, whishing back to reality.  Maggie lies
% in her crib, sucking on her pacifier.

M: Sweet dreams.

% (*click*)  The lights go off, but Maggie's eyes remain wide open.

M: [sweetly] Mmm...  Good night, dear.
H: Good night.

% They kiss.
%
% The three kids suddenly appear in the doorway, waving their arms
% frantically and talking simultaneously.

B: Dad, what you were saying about mind over matter?  Could you be
   more specific?
L: Mom, are those bedbugs... [unintelligible]  I can't sleep...

% Marge and Homer react.

M: [sigh]  All right, climb in.

% The kids zip in.  Bart next to Marge, Lisa next to Homer, and Maggie
% between her parents.  All three shiver.

H: There's nothing to worry about.  Now, everyone go to sleep.
   Good night.

% (*click*)  The lights go off, and one by one, the family members close
% their eyes.  Maggie's is last.

A: Goo' nigh', Da'.
