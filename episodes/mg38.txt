===============================================================================
% H = Homer, B = Bart, L = Lisa
%
% The kids watch an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.
%
% Scratchy chases Itchy down a hallway with an axe.  Itchy producse a picture
% of a female cat, and Scratchy skids to a halt, drops his jaw, and pops out
% his eyes.  Itchy tosses a stick of dynamite into Scratchy's open mouth.
% (*boom*)  Scratchy's head has been cleanly severed off (cartoon logic) and
% bounces around the floor.
%
% The kids stare, bored.  Bart slurps his soda.

H: What the hell are you kids watching?

% Homer has appeared.

L: It's Itchy and Scratchy.
B: Our favorite show.
H: Well, you're not watching it.

% Homer clicks the remote control.

B: Aw, Dad!
L: Come on, Homer!
H: No, it's too violent.  Go do something else.

% Homer leaves.

L: Now I'm <really> bored.
B: [gets an idea]  I know!

% Bart runs behind the television set, rips out the innards, tears the
% drapes from the window, and hangs them behind the (now empty) frame as
% a curtain.  Bart sings a fanfare and produces a a rabbit puppet, which
% serves as emcee.

B: It's the Bart Simpson Show!  Starring Bart Simpson!  Featuring the
   Bart Simpson Orchestra and the Bart Simpson Dancers!

% The girls applaud.

B: And now, here's the star of our show, Baaaaart Simpson!

% Bart opens the curtain and takes center stage.

B: Thanks, Ed.  Funny thing happened on my way to the studio tonight:
   I ran over my dad's head on my bike.

% Homer pops in, angry.

H: I thought I told you kids not to watch violent TV!
L: It's stupid, but it's not violent.
B: [indignant]  Oh, yeah!?
H: [confused] Bart?

% Homer grabs the remote control and clicks it.  The picture doesn't change.
% Homer then spots the TV poarts on the floor.

H: Why you little...
B: Whoa, gotta run, good-night folks!

% Bart quickly closes the curtain as Homer dives behind the TV set.
% Signs of a great struggle.  Maggie hops off the couch and opens
% the curtains, revealing Homer strangling Bart.  Maggie returns to
% the couch.  Bart strangles Homer back.  The girls applaud.
