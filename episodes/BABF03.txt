==============================================================================
   Apu learns he will have to sell much more squishees because he's about to
   become a dad eight times over.  However, he and Manjula (Jan Hooks) find
   that caring for octuplets is a trying task until a zoo owner (Garry
   Marshall) offers a lending hand. Butch Patrick ("The Munsters") guest-stars
   as himself.  {hl}

Blackboard:     INDIAN BURNS ARE NOT / OUR CULTURAL HERITAGE

Couch:          The Simpsons run in and fall into place on the couch, as
                usual.  Suddenly, the wall behind the couch spins around.  It
                whisks away the family and reveals Ned Flanders, bolted
                upside-down to the other side of the wall.  Vincent Price
                stands next to him, laughing evilly.

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Wilson Banswell:  Wow!  This episode really surprised me.  There were some
   good sight gags, for the first time in a while.  And the way the episode
   went surprised me also. I thought the episode would focus on Homer, rather
   than Apu and co. but it didn't.  But of course there were some downsides.
   The ending was okay, yet dumb. And Apu's sarcasm to Marge was out of
   character.  Other than those and other small little bad things, this
   episode has a  (B)

Nathan DeHoff:  I'm not quite sure what to say about this episode.  It had its
   funny moments, and didn't leave a bad taste, as I feared it might.  Nothing
   much really happened, though, and the main conflict was never actually
   resolved.  Because Homer is willing to be attacked by snakes in order to
   help Apu and Manjula, they can suddenly handle eight babies?  Whatever.
   (C)

Alex Flandonwittsy:  A pretty strong OFF outing.  Although the plot can be
   summed up in one sentence, and it has a reasonably far-out premise, the way
   each act is written is what counts.  Some big laughs are scored in the
   first few scenes("Pee & See", "baby, baby ... lemon!"), and for once an
   episode is based squarely on a secondary character.  No wacky Homer
   crusades to speak of; Heck, Manjula even had a bigger part than him.  If
   there are some negatives worth pointing out, they would have to be Homer's
   endless, not-funny-after-the-second-time quotes from the 90's("Don't go
   there!", etc..), and the forced celebrity cameo by TV's Eddie Munster.  All
   in all, though, another wins for Matt Selman, and season eleven.  (B)

Curtis Gibby:  There were some great jokes ("Avec plaisir!"), and the plot was
   a lot less bizarre than last week's "Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder."  I
   especially liked the gags with the TV news reporters' suggestions for sound
   bites (Huzzah!  That's the business I'm training myself for!) and Apu's
   repetition of "I can't believe you don't shut up!"  I enjoyed the Simpsons'
   adventures during the nine months of Manjula's pregnancy, but I wondered
   why we never saw the Kwik-E-Mart after the middle of Act II, and never saw
   Sanjay at all.  Wouldn't Apu want his brother's help and advice over idiot
   Homer's?  I wasn't sure how I felt after one viewing, but watching it again
   was a joy.  I liked the previous "Apu and Manjula" episode better, but I'll
   give this episode an  (A-)

Joe Green:  Not exactly an instant classic, but still enjoyable.  (And for
   once, non-Homer-centric!)  The best jokes tended to be concentrated in the
   first act, like Allen Wrench and the Lego utensils.  (B+)

Richard Green:  This episode was just ... weird.  There were a couple of funny
   parts (I LOVED the part when OFF was in the car and talking about
   experiences that happened to them, based on ideas that could've been entire
   episodes), but it was just weird -- all of the Sh0p things, the
   America-India comparisons,  all the ovulating stuff,  the whole ZOO thing
   (especially the turtle and the gorillas), the final scene .... They were
   obviously making fun of all those octuplet stories that Dateline constantly
   tries to turn into "parents are heroes for keeping them alive and taking
   care of them (even though this is what is EXPECTED of American parents)"
   stories.  (B)

Darrel Jones:  At first, I thought this episode would suck.  But I was
   pleasantly surprised by what I saw.  The whole first act was LOL hilarious
   (as it has been all season).  A few more classic Homerisms like "See,
   you've got that look on your face right now!" make it funny.  I also liked
   the way the "Shelbyville Nine" distracted attention from the Apu's eight
   kids.  The only part I didn't like was Apu wearing eight baby bottles, and
   seeing the top was drain was sickening.  A Season Eleven classic!  (A+)

Andrew Levine:  It's a sad time for The Simpsons as a franchise when it can be
   noted to a new episode's credit that it contains no talking animals,
   radioactive snacks, or fantasy creatures.  That said, BABF03 was nearly as
   good an episode as we are likely to get from the much-prematurely-lauded
   BABF series.  Although many of the staples of the season 9-11 playbook are
   present (what is the current writing staff's fascination with the zoo?),
   there was some refreshingly sharp material; the scene concerning the
   conveniently-tossed-aside nine months was an instant classic, and there is
   some nice satire (I liked Wiggum's "A lot of people are doing that these
   days.")  Still, as hard as this episode tries, it can't escape the
   archetypes (Pee-and-See?  Whose 4-year-old made that up?)  that have kept
   the show down for the last 3 seasons.  Although my grade is a solid B, it
   would have been a C- anywhere in the first 7 seasons.  (B)

Adam Long:  Pretty good episode, the upside to the ever-apparent lack of plots
   is that there are some real sparks of creativity to come up with something
   new.  Great first act, I was laughing pretty much non-stop, but
   unfortunately the last two weren't as entertaining, IMHO.  One thing I
   liked about this one is that the episode didn't turn out as outrageous at
   it sounded.  The plot of "Manjula has octuplets and when her and Apu cannot
   support them they sell them to a zoo," as silly as it sounds, was actually
   made somewhat believable.  (B+)

Ben Marlin:  Not an instant classic, but for the first time in a while, a
   solid episode whose plot I'll actually remember in a week or two.  There
   was actual caring between the two families, not forced sentimentality
   shoved in our face like with Homer and Maggie last week; Jerkass Homer was
   replaced (if only temporarily) by his old bumbling but well-intentioned
   self.  Plus, most of the jokes and sight gags worked, and the plot stayed
   in one place the whole time. I doubt the writers will keep up this standard
   of creativity, but it was nice to thoroughly enjoy an episode again.  (B+)

Abhi Rey:  A great episode.  Matt Selman takes an interesting social topic,
   such as the birth of octuplets through fertility drugs, incorporates it
   into the epic story of Apu's starting a life in America, and treats it with
   wit and charm.  Some great scenes include the revealing of the babies to
   Apu, Homer's disastrous cobra stunt, Homer's trying to get Apu and Manjula
   to conceive, and many others.  (B+)

Tom Rinschler:  Not bad altogether, although the first act rises above the
   later two. Some things in the episode tended to get a bit silly, but
   overall a great improvement over last week's cartoonishness.  The zoo
   scenes were a great satire of the media circus and exploitation that
   surrounds multiple births.  Not the best, but having enough laughs to make
   rise above average.  (B)

Eric Sansoni:  Season 11 continues with a roar, of laughter that is, with the
   second best episode of the Scully era after "Natural Born Kissers."  We
   couldn't entirely escape a tacked-on intro full of awkward jokes, but it is
   one of the shortest in recent memory.  Even the obligatory celebrity cameo
   sets itself apart by parodying the big-name guest star gimmick.  Matt
   Selman shows yet again that he alone among the newer writers fully under-
   stands the show.  Exaggeration of our modern-day idiosyncrasies replaces
   all-out zaniness, thorough character interaction stands in for formulaic
   subplots, and laughs are enhanced by a story that brings out meaningful
   emotion, not aimed at ripping our care for the characters to shreds.  (A)

Yours Truly:  Apu, who started out as a one-note background character, has
   grown into such an interesting character that he can support one of the
   longest-running story arcs in the "Simpsons" universe.  "Eight Misbehavin'"
   adroitly blends the show's "heavy" elements -- Apu and Manjula's
   exhaustion, and their handing the kids over to the zoo -- with humorous
   scenes like the Shøp sequence, or the couple's reaction to Marge's offering
   of banana bread.  The guest roles (for Garry Marshall and Butch Patrick)
   added something to the story, rather than just being window dressing.  Our
   favorite family should watch out.  Now that Apu has a wife and kids of his
   own, can "The Nahasapeemapetilons" be far behind on Fox's schedule?  (B+)

>> Guest Star Patrol

 - Garry Marshall

Brian Charles Kohn:  [Larry Kidkill] was Garry Marshall, who played Stan on
   Murphy Brown.  I associate him with his work as a producer and director,
   more than with his acting work. At times, I believe he ran the "Odd
   Couple," "Happy Days," "Laverne & Shirley," and "Mork & Mindy."  He's also
   directed a bunch of feature films, including "The Flamingo Kid" (in which a
   friend of mine had a small role), "Beaches," "Pretty Woman," and "Runaway
   Bride."


Dan Tropea:  Don't forget the really, really horrible movie "Exit To Eden."
   But since he did Beaches I think we can forgive his one screw-up -- "Exit
   To Eden."  But his TV shows were by and large good plus he did more then
   anyone else to make Robin Williams a household name.  BTW have they ever
   worked together beyond "Mork and Mindy?"  I believe they never have.  A
   falling out perhaps?  Or just a coincidence?


Mike Smith:  His sister, Penny, was Miss Botz in "Some Enchanted Evening".


 - Butch Patrick

Joe Klemm:  Butch Patrick is a typical example of a television child actor.
   Many people only recognize him as the kid who played Eddie Munster on the
   1960's sitcom "The Munsters."  However, he has done other projects,
   including the Sid and Marty Krofft show "Lidsville" and a couple of Little
   Caesar ads with Jimmie Walker and Evel Knievel.


>> "Everyone at school picks on the Pöpli kids, even I do."

Curtis Gibby shares his pain:  When I was in sixth grade, it was the Trapper
   Keeper.  If you didn't have one for your school papers, you were nothing.
   If you had a cheap knock-off of Trapper Keeper, it was even worse.  With
   the Velcro and the storing and the metal teeth and the blood rain and the
   hey-hey it hurts me.  Anyway, I thought Lisa and Marge's interchange was a
   good commentary on the commercialism of today's kids.


>> Bet you can't have just one!

Mike Smith:  Multiple births in the news:  A Houston couple, Nkem Chukwu and
   Iyke Louis Udobi, had octuplets in late 1998, seven of which survived.  The
   McCaughey septuplets, born in late 1997.  This was the first birth to have
   seven surviving children.


Benjamin Robinson:  In just about every human culture, the inability to have
   children is seen as one of the saddest fates that can befall a couple.
   Would-be parents faced either years of waiting for a child to become
   available through the adoption process, or resigned themselves to
   childlessness. When they first appeared, fertility drugs seemed like a gift
   from the heavens, but over time they began to be more like Pandora's box.
   The problem was that the drugs worked too well -- instead of one or perhaps
   two children, couples would suddenly have four, five, or even more at once.

   Recently, the McCaughey family made the headlines for having seven
   children.  The media initially played it like a feel-good modern miracle.
   Gradually, more cynical columnists expressed their doubts.  Their
   skepticism may be well- founded.  Doctors are convinced that any pregnancy
   involving more than, say, twins is medically risky.  There's only so much
   room in the womb, and the children are often born prematurely, and small
   even for preemies.  Often, they'll have other health problems, as well.
   Even today, two years after their birth, two of the McCaughey children
   cannot sit up properly.  Apu and Manjula are doubly lucky in that nobody in
   their brood seems to suffer from any illnesses (which would have been a
   huge downer, anyway).

   Medical technology has tested ethics in other ways.  Some doctors use a
   method called "selective termination" to abort the less-viable fetuses,
   giving the others a better chance of surviving birth.  Others recoil at the
   idea, considering it no better than murder.  A few people have even
   questioned the idea of fertility drugs themselves, feeling that it defies
   the will of God.


"Rilchiam" adds:  The doctors for the Houston woman wanted to abort some of
   the fetuses to give the others a better chance at survival.  She refused,
   on the grounds that "it wasn't God's will".  I guess it was God's will for
   her to get all those fertility treatments.


Jason Hancock:  Like Apu and Manjula, the McCaugheys got tons of gifts from
   businesses in and around their hometown of Carlisle, Iowa (just outside of
   Des Moines).  Among many things, they got a new van, furniture, diapers,
   free cable TV, and even college scholarships for the children.  (Yet unlike
   the Nahasapeemapetilons, they weren't taken away from them after the next
   big multiple birth occurred.)


Someone known as "Dutchdummy":  I just read a follow up article in the local
   paper [which] had an interview with Mr. McCaughey.  He made a comment that
   the fact that they had a house and a number of lifetime supplies of baby
   products donated to them "proved" that God was "providing" for them.  That
   must come as a surprise to the many individuals and companies that donated
   their time and money.


>> When five of a kind is also a full house

Haynes Lee:  Born May 28, 1934 to rural parents near North Bay, Ontario,
   Canada, the five identical quintuplets were considered a medical miracle.
   Under advisement of the doctor who delivered them they were made wards of
   the Province of Ontario and placed in a specially built hospital.  They
   rarely saw their parents or siblings.  Three million people went to
   "Quintland" to see the quints and generated 500 million dollars in tourism.
   Despite this the children were miserable and saw little of the money.  It
   was only recently the three remaining living sisters finally got some
   compensation and an apology from the Ontario government.


Brent McKee adds:  The five girls (Emilie, Annette, Marie, Cecile, and Yvonne)
   were born in May 1934 in Corbeil Ontario.  Their father Oliva Dionne
   received an offer to exhibit them at the 1934 Chicago World's Fair which he
   accepted.  This was when the Ontario government stepped in and took over
   their guardianship.  The government built "Quintland" at Callander to
   exhibit them.  They also supervised the endorsement contracts that the
   quints got. They also made sure that the only way their parents _ever_ got
   to see them was if they took the tour.  Custody was not restored to the
   Dionne family until 1943, but the relations between the five girls and
   their parents and siblings was never good.

   Of the five, only three are still alive.  Emilie entered a convent, but
   died of an epileptic seizure in 1954.  Her sister Marie died, alone in her
   apartment, apparently of a blood clot on her brain (the body, when found,
   was so decomposed that no cause of death could be accurately determined).
   The other three sisters successfully reached a settlement with the Ontario
   government recently over financial irregularities in the trust fund that
   had been set up for them as children and their role as Canada's biggest
   tourist draw in the 1930's.

   An excellent book about the quints is Pierre Berton's "The Dionne Years".


Alan Hamilton:  The girls were shown several times a day, with over 3 million
   visitors seeing the girls in their habitat, er, nursery.  The girls never
   got any of the estimated C$22 million (in 1998 Canadian dollars) that was
   supposed to be in a trust fund. The three survivors settled a lawsuit with
   the Canadian government for C$4 million (US$2.8 million) in 1998.  See
   http://cnn.com/US/9711/19/dionne.quints/index.html for more information,
   including a picture of a "Next Showing" clock.


Mike Smith:  [The Dionnes' doctor] even made a movie about them in 1936 by,
   off all people, a then-newly-formed company called 20th Century Fox, called
   "The Country Doctor", with Jean Hersolt (Who humanitarian Oscar is named
   for him).  A wonderful miniseries on their exploitation, called "Million
   Dollar Babies", was aired on CBS a few years back.


Sarah Culp comments on "Octopia":  And I still feel that even if the baby show
   WAS real, it would still be more humane than any Anne Geddes picture.


>> Only *you* can prevent underpopulation

Benjamin Robinson:  Apu mentions that America is "dangerously underpopulated."
   From his standpoint, that might be true.  India, a nation that has less
   land than the United States, claims a population four times larger at one
   billion.  (Having eight kids at a clip will certainly take care of that
   problem!)


>> Name That Child

Cletus may have had to name more children, but Manjula had more exotic names.
   J. C. Ice provides them for us:  With the help of the close captioning,
   here are the names of Apu and Manjula's octuplets:  Poonam, Sashi, Pria,
   Uma, Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu, and Gheet.  As far as I can tell, there were
   6 boys and 2 girls (Sashi and Pria).


>> Raising children the vegan way

Nathan DeHoff wonders:  I hadn't really thought of this before, but, in "Eight
   Misbehavin'", Apu was feeding his children milk (presumably from a cow),
   despite his strict veganism.  I suppose that necessity outweighed morality
   in that case (after all, would Manjula have been able to nurse all eight of
   those babies?), but it does make me wonder if Apu will raise his children
   to be vegetarians.


John Jensen:  One word:  Formula


Wilson Defarge:  Another word: SOY


"Quinten":  Do you know that it was milk from another animal?  They do have
   breast pumps,  which mothers can use to "store up" milk for their babies,
   so that they have it when it's needed.  It also could have been imitation
   milk too.


Pete Klassen:  Well, actually, Apu may be a vegan.  Manjula & the kids might
   be none.

   [I guess Mr. DeHoff can consider his question answered now! -- Ed.]


>> Not for use as a knockout drug

Benjamin Robinson:  Colorforms were (and possibly still are) a popular
   children's toy.  A Colorforms set was organized around a theme, like a
   cartoon or the Wild West.  You got a bunch of vinyl cutouts, and a
   laminated backdrop.  The idea was to while away the hours creating your own
   tableaux by sticking the cutouts to the backdrop as imagination dictates.
   Colorforms cutouts also stuck great to furniture, TV screens, major
   appliances, and the like, and as a result parents would find cutouts
   scattered all around the house.  Great fun!


Chris Palm reminisces:  Hehe ... am I the only one young enough around here to
   have remembered playing with a Simpsons Colorform set as a child?


>> Whither Apu?

There is no continuity in "The Simpsons."  Or is there?  R. David Francis
   writes:  It's interesting to me that Apu seems like the only character on
   the Simpsons who has undergone permanent visible changes.  Many characters
   change for the course of an episode.  A few have changed permanently, but
   not visibly (Ned's being 60 or learning to let his anger go; Selma's two
   marriages, Skinner's not being Skinner (which referred to the fact that
   this permanent change would never be referred to again in the episode
   itself)).  However, Apu has gotten married and remained married, with his
   wife having showed up not only in Apu-centric episodes (5F04, AABF11), but
   also in bit parts in other episodes (at least 5F14, where Apu and Manjula
   pop into a photo booth).  Now, he has eight children, who were not
   eliminated at the end of the show (there are ways that this could have been
   dealt with; perhaps sending the tykes off to live with the family in
   India).  So presumably, there will be future references to the kids.


Speaking of future references to the children, Justin Cass wondered:  In
   future episodes, what will happen the 8 kids?  Will they still be young and
   not age like everyone else, or will they be older making for some more
   interesting plots?


Don Del Grande responds:  Well, as Sanjay's two kids have not aged, I assume
   Apu's won't age either. Otherwise, they would be out of place.

   (It wouldn't be the first time if some characters aged faster than others;
   Charles Schulz did it with Sally and Rerun on "Peanuts".  However, if you
   do age Apu's kids, you run into a potential problem: how do you explain
   that Manjula wanted a kid after seeing Maggie if her kids end up being
   older than Maggie is?)

   My guess as to "what happens next": you'll start seeing Manjula pushing a
   "eight-person baby carriage" (or Apu and Manjula each pushing a four-baby
   carriage) in the background in upcoming episodes.

   Or, they can always just keep saying "the kids are with Manjula" over and
   over again ...


>> Do they give a volume discount for bulk enrollment?

Paul Manion describes the link between this episode, and the University of
   Pennsylvania:  There were a few DYN's that probably only appeal to people
   who attend the University of Pennsylvania, but whatever.  I was reading a
   newsletter at our campus paper that had a "Catching up with alumni" section
   on Matt Selman, who graduated from Penn and used to be an editor of the
   paper I now write for, so when I saw he wrote last night's episode, my
   interest was piqued.  Here's what I caught ...

   ... The giant baby blocks in the zoo spelled out "Y-U-O-P."  Phonetically,
   that's close enough to U of P, a name by which Penn is sometimes referred.

   Apu's reference in Homer's scripted skit to "Ivy League State" has to be a
   play on the public misconception that the University of Pennsylvania, or
   Penn, is the same school as Penn State.  Anyone who's ever told someone
   they go to Penn knows the pain of having to instantly correct the other
   person and say, "No, not Penn State."  [Sounds like a bit of a stretch to
   me ... -- Ed.]

Patrick:	That's right.  I was TV's Eddie Munster, and being 
		in the public eye didn't mess me up one bit.
Apu:		Mm-hm.  Well, obviously.  Hey, one question, Eddie.
Patrick:	Butch.
Apu:		Yeah, right, right.  If your mother was a vampire 
		and your father was a Frankenstein, how come you are 
		a werewolf?
Patrick:	Huh, I never thought of that.  Doesn't make sense, 
		does it?  But what does make sense is putting your 
		children in the hands of Mr. Kidkill here.
Kidkill:	Please, please -- Larry, Larry Kidkill.
-- "Eight Misbehavin'"

% Like Apu, Manjula initially is reluctant to embrace the idea of 
% putting their children on display.  Apu persuades her, saying the 
% kids will get a traditional "zooish" upbringing.  Manjula agrees and 
% signs the contract.  The ever-versatile Butch Patrick is on the spot 
% to notarize the agreement.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:38]
%
% Apu, Manjula, and the children have settled into a cozy domestic 
% routine.  Kidkill drops by on the couple to see how they are doing.  
% Then, he announces that it's show time.  A troop of choreographers, 
% costumers, and other theater people stream in, and hustle Apu and 
% Manjula out of the nursery, er, habitat.
%
% And now, on with the show!

Bart:		[in audience] I can't believe we're going to see the 
		octuplets.
Lisa:		You already saw them.
Bart:		Yeah, but now they're umbilical cords have fallen 
		off!
		[Kidkill stands onstage]
Kidkill:	Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the eight 
		wonders of the third world.  Welcome to Octopia!
		[music plays, and the curtain rises, revealing the 
		set.  The audience applauds]
		He can't talk, but man, can he rock.  Say hello to 
		the baddest baby in the whole damn town -- Animal!
		["Welcome to the Jungle" plays.  A crib rises from 
		the stage floor, tilted so the audience can get a 
		view of little Animal.  He's got a leather jacket 
		and a tiny guitar, which he's drooling on.  The 
		audience says, "Aw"]
Lisa:		How can he rebel?  He doesn't even know where he is.
		[jazzy nightclub music plays]
Kidkill:	Uh, oh -- sounds like one of the babies has a fever!
Marge:		[gasps]
Kidkill:	Dance fever, that is.
Marge:		[relieved] Ohh.  [laughs]
Kidkill:	Let's hear it for Dazzle!
		[another crib rises to show another baby dressed 
		like a cabaret girl.  The crib rocks a little to 
		simulate dancing]
Homer:		She's no Liza, but it works.
		[bouncy piano music]
Kidkill:	And now the stand-up who can't even sit up.  Give it 
		up for Punchline!
		[crib with a brick wall backdrop lowers from the 
		ceiling.  Inside is a baby in front of a prop 
		microphone.  He sucks his knuckles, and the audience 
		laughs wildly]
Lenny:		He's thinking what we're all saying.
Kidkill:	But all the laughs in the world won't protect you 
		from the stern discipline of the Baron.
		["Ride of the Valkyrie" plays, as a cradle decorated 
		like a World War I German war zeppelin is suspended 
		from the ceiling, and moved over the stage.  Inside 
		is a baby dressed in a monocle and goatee, carrying 
		a riding whip.  The audience boos]
		And, the rest!
		[the an American flag rises up, with four cribs 
		suspended underneath it.  "ROCK in the USA" plays, 
		lasers shoot beams through the air, and (fully 
		grown) dancing girls come out and do the twist.  
		Finally, a man dressed like Uncle Sam's younger 
		brother rides on ostrich onstage]
Man:		Good night, Springfield!  We'll be back in an hour.
-- That's entertainment!  "Eight Misbehavin'"

% Apu and Manjula seem to be the only people disturbed by Octopia.  
% Backstage, the choreographer takes time to compliment some of the 
% babies.  (Not all of them, however.  He tells his assistant to, 
% "work with Dazzle; she's a lox out there."  Meanwhile, Manjula takes 
% Mr. Kidkill to task.

Manjula:	How could you do this to our children?
Kidkill:	I know, the lighting cues were a mess.  Don't worry, 
		the guy's been fired.
Apu:		Our babies are not circus freaks.  We're taking them 
		home now.
Kidkill:	[blocking his exit] Hold on, Alpo.  [holds up 
		contract] We got a contract.
Apu:		[taking contract] Not any more.  [tries to tear it 
		up, but he can't] Laminated -- you monster!
-- "Eight Misbehavin'"

% Kidkill sics his hired goons on Apu and Manjula.  They turn to the 
% long arm of the law to help.

Wiggum:		I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.
Apu:		The zookeeper paid you off, didn't he?
Wiggum:		Paid me off?  What are you, crazy?  [reaches by desk 
		for a big bag of "elephant grade" peanuts]
Manjula:	So we'll never see our children again?
Wiggum:		Well, they might give Dazzle back.  The buzz is 
		she's got one more show to turn it around.
Apu:		Well, if the police won't help us, we'll simply have 
		to take the law into our own hands.
Wiggum:		Yeah, yeah!  A lot of people are doing that these 
		days.
-- I wonder why, "Eight Misbehavin'"

% Nobody knows homemade justice better than Homer Simpson, so Apu 
% recruits him to help rescue the children.  The two sneak into 
% Kidkill's zoo after closing time.  Apu remarks on how differently 
% the animals behave after dark.  He isn't kidding -- turtles in their 
% pen jump athletically from one tree branch to the next.  In the next 
% cage, three koala bears have brought down a gazelle.  The fur around 
% their mouths soaked with blood, they briefly stop feeding on their 
% kill to look at Homer and Apu.
%
% Homer and Apu break into the nursery.  The babies are sleeping 
% peacefully, as is the nanny assigned the night watch.  She begins to 
% rouse.

Apu:	She's waking up.
Homer:	Don't worry.  I brought some chloroform.  [takes something 
	and applies it to the nanny's face]
Apu:	You idiot -- those are Colorforms!
	[camera perspective shifts to reveal that Homer has stuck 
	little Colorform shapes to the nanny's face]
-- "Eight Misbehavin'"

% With a scream, the nanny wakes up and sounds the alarm.  Homer and 
% Apu hastily load the babies into their car.  As Homer appears to 
% make their getaway, a gorilla mother appears at the zoo gate.  She 
% holds her baby over her head, as if imploring Homer and Apu to take 
% it to freedom.  Freaked, Homer takes off.
%
% Safe at home ...

Manjula:	Oh, my precious babies.  We'll never let you go.
Apu:		[holding the baby formerly known as "Baron"] Oh, 
		let's get this awful thing off.  [removes the fake 
		goatee, but the baby fusses and reaches after it.  
		Apu lets him take it back] Okay, whatever.
		[the door opens, and Kidkill and his goons rush in]
Christopher:	Okay, hold it right there, scumbags!
Manjula:	[gasps]
Homer:		Please, Mr. Kidkill, look into your heart.  I know 
		these babies have a lifetime contract, but what if I 
		put together an even better act for you?  Something 
		sensational!
Kidkill:	It's not just you prancing around in a monkey suit, 
		is it?
Homer:		Not any more!
Kidkill:	You got yourself a deal.
-- "Eight Misbehavin'"

% The next thing we know, Homer is on the former Octopia stage, riding 
% a tricycle and carrying Butch Patrick on his back.  As if that 
% wasn't difficult enough, Homer must share the stage with a bunch of 
% angry cobras.  Appropriately, "Highway to the Danger Zone" plays 
% over the PA system.  Homer struggles to keep the hissing snakes from 
% biting him.

Patrick:	Quiet!  You're breaking character!
Lisa:		[in audience] Are those real cobras?
Bart:		[checks the program] Some are real, some are just 
		robots filled with venom.
Apu:		Now that is a true friend.
Manjula:	You know, if he can handle that, maybe we can handle 
		this bunch [indicates their children].
Apu:		We'll do our best, chutney butt.
		[camera cuts back to stage]
Homer:		Okay, okay, don't panic, Butch.  [to stagehand] 
		Release the mongoose!
		[the stagehand does so.  The terrified mongoose 
		hesitates, then jumps on Homer's head and bites him.  
		The audience applauds, as Homer screams in pain]
		[fade to black, as the closing theme music plays]
		Stupid mongoose!  Get the snakes!  The snakes!  Do I 
		look like a snake?  Ow!  Ow!  Why isn't he listening 
		to me?  Ow!  Ohhh.  Show's over!  Show's over!  Next 
		show at eight o'clock and ten!
-- The show must go on, "Eight Misbehavin'"
