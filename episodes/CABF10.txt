> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [TV Guide ad] Double page advertisement for episode CABF10 "Day of the
   Jackanapes".  "Sideshow Bob Returns to Springfield for Revenge!"  "Guest
   Star: Kelsey Grammer".  The head (and hair) of Sideshow Bob appears spread
   across two pages, with Bart in the background, arms crossed, saying "It's
   not every kid my age who has an archenemy."  Fox is pulling out all the
   stops for the February sweeps.  Small boxes for three other shows appear on
   the same pages.  {bg}

   [TV Guide Close-Up] Inside the Criminal Mind -- Kelsey Grammer returns as
   Sideshow Bob, who surfaces with yet another murderous scheme.  Krusty the
   Clown decides to retire (again) because he's sick of creative input from
   network executives.  In an interview leading up to his last show, Krusty
   reveals that his early episodes with Bob were lost (Krusty taped over
   them).  That news makes Bob see red, so he talks his way out of prison and
   into a job at Springfield Elementary.  There, he captures Bart, who
   declares he has no fear as Bob's always been the loser in their
   entanglements.  But hypnosis turns Bart into a zombie-like accomplice for
   Bob's plan to send Krusty on a fond-and-explosive-farewell.  {bg}

+  Krusty's claim that he was in show business for 61 years seems to
   inconsistent with what we know about him.  [See "Comments" section for more
   -- Ed.]  {dld}

=  Smithers comes in to announce that Maggie has just shot Burns, and yet
   Maggie is sitting there at the table in her high chair!  (Perhaps it's the
   little sister of  Lester and Eliza that did the evil deed, and she's trying
   to frame Maggie?)  {dld}

*  How come Cecil wasn't sharing a cell with Bob?  [Anthony Scrima theorizes,
   "Maybe they got separated?" -- Ed.]

+  Why did Bob turn evil again after [4F14]?  [Eric Sansoni counters, "I think
   it's obvious by the end of the Cecil episode that just being arrested again
   was enough to frustrate Sideshow Bob back into a criminal career."]  {jg2}

+  If Sideshow Bob is ashamed of his work as Krusty's sidekick as in previous
   episodes, why would he be so angry that they've been taped over?  [Eric
   Sansoni answers, "Because whether or not I'm proud of my work, it's a huge
   insult for someone to destroy it without even consulting me." -- Ed.]  {el}

*  Either he [Krusty] only taped over the Sideshow Bob tapes or he records a
   lot of Judge Judy because he did the show for over 30 years.  {jk}

*  Why in the world would Principal Skinner hire Sideshow Bob to do work at
   the school, given his long criminal record (and especially after the events
   in "Pokey Mom" earlier this season)?  {dld}

-  The curling stone in the sports shed was far too big.  {ddg}

*  Sideshow Bob was spinning a target with concentric circles, so it shouldn't
   have appeared as a hypnotic spiral.

+  Flanders was not only at the Krusty Farewell Show, he had also brought Rod
   and Todd with him?  (This IS the guy who had locked out almost all his
   satellite dish channels on the TV, and nearly had a conniption fit when he
   and his family witnessed their first Itchy And Scratchy cartoon, which of
   course is carried on Krusty's show).  {dld}

+  Krusty's early TV history contradicts what we saw in "Bart of Darkness
   (1F22)" and "I Love Lisa (9F13)."

+  If Krusty really was sorry about laying off Bob and wanted to make amends,
   why did he tape over all Bob's episodes and publicly decry him to Kent?
   Mucho plot hole ...  {al}

=  When Mr. Teeny grabbed the plastic explosive belt, the detonators were no
   longer attached to it ...  {ddg}

*  ... yet it managed to explode when he threw it into the room with the
   executives.  {ddg}

*  Bob got the death penalty for attempted assassination?  Wow, the police in
   Springfield are tough on crime.  {bjr}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Steve Alpert:  The Sideshow Bob episodes have traditionally been excellent
   compared to others of their season, and this was no exception.  Finally,
   plot development within the first few minutes.  Typical Simpsons logical
   leaps (Bob getting the school announcement, no one caring when Bart goes to
   the abandoned toolshed, Simpsons getting free passes to Krusty's final
   show), and the endings continue to get slightly and slightly more normal.
   Overall, it's hovering on the brink of an A, and given the show's continued
   recovery, I'll give in just this once.  (A)

Joe Green:  The first act was almost pure gold, but the main body of this
   episode didn't live up to my expectations.  In the final act it started to
   pick up again, but the ending was too silly for its own good.  I have mixed
   feelings about Sideshow Bob's role- he made a great recurring villain, but
   this episode seemed to be based on the idea that [4F14] never happened.
   (B+)

Darrel Jones:  What a way to end a run!  Definitely Bob's best episode since
   "Sideshow Bob Roberts".  More deserving for an ending than "Brother from
   Another Series".  True, not all of it worked, but Bob's scheme was good,
   and Chief Wiggum and the network execs were supoib.  ("Sure, they're a fad,
   but they'll be around forever" is bound to become one of OFF's all-time
   classic lines.)  I give it 9 thumbs up, or 9/10  (A+)

Troy J. Mathews:  My premise on the three acts of tonight's episode were as
   follow:  1. ok  2. great 3. ok -- with a let down.  The let down of course
   was Sideshow Bob and Krusty getting along with each other at the end of the
   show.  Otherwise a decent episode.  (A-)

Michael Nusair:  Sideshow Bob episodes are always good, and this one was no
   exception. While this wasn't one of the best in the Bob series, it was
   still a good episode.  There were lots of laughs, but the plot didn't quite
   seem right to me.  And apparently, the sarcastic guy's name is Raphael,
   which is a little strange.  Good to know, I guess.  Anyway, this was a good
   episode, but for a Sideshow Bob episode, not a great one.  (B+)

Alex Parrish:  After the absolutely appalling "Tennis the Menace", this was a
   delightful return to some more involved humour.  Although the plot was
   still formed around the jokes instead of the other way round, "Day of the
   Jackanapes" had some great scenes, although you still get the baffling
   sense that the characters are waiting for your laughter to subside after
   making a joke; something that is indeed very strange to witness on an
   animated show, as we all know that live cartoons put a terrible strain on
   the animator's wrist.  This wasn't even as good as "Homer vs. Dignity" or
   "The Great Money Caper", but compared with everything else from this
   ungodly season, it was a welcome breath of fresh air from the other crap.
   (B-)

Mike Reed:  Maybe Sideshow Bob just makes an episode good.  All of them have
   been above-average and CABF10 was no exception.  I liked the way it started
   out with a good parody of "Millionaire" and it only went up from there.
   The "Maggie shoots Burns" bit had me in stitches, and Krusty unveiling the
   tribute to Bob is my biggest laugh this season.  (So far.)  Not to mention
   the rake reprisal, the quarter, the cops in the restaurant, etc, etc, etc.
   My one complaint could be the ending, which plays on shock-value for a
   laugh, but, I'll let it slide by this time.  Best of season?  Yep.  (A-)

Robin Steinmann:  Although far from being a classic Sideshow Bob-episode a
   pretty decent showing for the last seasons.  Hardly any flaws, apart from a
   massive under-usage of Lisa, who was always one of the main characters in
   Bob show.  I excuse the [...] exaggerated use of meta-jokes and references
   on TV-politics in the first few minutes, because otherwise we saw a rather
   coherent plotline with stable characterisations, great references to older
   SB-appearances, and quite amusing moments.  The ending was a bit alienating
   though, not only the liquid TV-execs, but also the foreshadowed death of
   Robert Underdunk Terwilliger.  I would really like to see him back, as he
   made me giving this episode a solid (S12 standard)  (A)

Yours Truly:  Sideshow Bob's back, and back to his (mostly) malevolent form.
   As usual, his scenes are the best ones in the show.  His plot for revenge
   on both is mortal enemies, and his efforts to brainwash Bart, are great.
   The pacing of the rest of the show was off, though.  In particular, the
   scene at the restaurant felt overlong, even though it didn't use much
   "clock time."  The network exec kibitzing seemed accurate enough, but felt
   like something I had seen on the show before.  This episode would have been
   funnier, or at least more dramatic, if the people who knew Bart confronted
   him more about his odd behavior.  It was nice to see Bob again, though.
   Let's hope that it isn't another three years before he and Bart cross
   swords again.  (B-)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B+ (3.18)   Std Dev.: 0.7873   (13 reviews computed)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Words about writers

From "Attmay":  Anyone notice that a guy named Bob Bendetson is now one of the
   producers?

   Well, having seen the majority of episodes of Facts of Life, ALF, and
   Newhart (1980s one), this guy worked as producer for all those shows
   shortly before they went off the air.


>> Musical References

Joe Green:  "You Sexy Thing" by Hot Chocolate played during Mr. Teeny's strip-
   tease.


>> Meta-humor corner

Daniel L. Dreibelbis:  In what was an obvious dig at a.t.s. and  a number of
   TV critics , Marge opines that perhaps it's good that TV shows go off the
   air before their plots become "stale and predictable" - and then Smithers
   rushes in to tell OFF that Maggie has shot Mr. Burns again!


>> Me Wantee!

Benjamin Robinson:  Variations on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire," the game
   show on which "Me Wantee!" is obviously based, air around the world, so
   viewers would be immediately familiar with the opening scenes.  It's
   interesting to note a few subtle discrepancies between WWTBAM and it's
   cartoon version.  As far as I know, "Millionaire" contestants aren't
   directed to stall ["but they are encouraged to deliberate over the hard
   questions," writes Zan Hect], but the show does give them an unlimited time
   to deliberate (a rarity in the game show universe).  The record so far is
   fifty minutes; this was edited down to a more reasonable time for the
   broadcast.

   Unlike "Me Wantee," "Millionaire" doesn't air live, so phone-a-friends
   can't be watching the show when they are called.  (In fact, someone from
   the production staff calls them ahead of time, to make sure that they can
   be reached if needed.)  Of course, this means that Lisa wouldn't have been
   able to jump in and save Moe's hide.

   Moe elects to play it safe and take home US$500,000.  Contestants on
   "Millionaire" can do the same thing, but usually Regis reveal the trivia
   question before the contestant decides to stay or go.

   The spoof was due payback, since "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" has asked
   "Simpsons"-related questions on about twelve occasions.


Jessy Scholl:  Another thing, the question that that Moe faced this week is
   the same as a US $100 question on Millionaire.


>> Fast Fortune

Matt H objects to Moe's US$500,000 windfall:  This wouldn't happen in the old
   days of Simpsons, cause nowadays they aren't accountable for anything the
   characters did in any other episode.  They might as well have a character
   that gets killed every episode.  "You bastards!"  ["What about Hans
   Moleman," asks Michael Nusair -- Ed.]


Stephen Houchen responds:  I suspect that Moe's always been rich.  He seems
   like the penny-pincher, miserly type who could be rich and you'd never know
   it.  Plus, he was a soap opera star for awhile ...


Steve Alpert:  Wait till he gets a girl ...


Shi No Bai agrees:  I don't think the $500K will be around very long.  Moe's
   always involved in some sort of illegal activity that gets shut down before
   he can make a profit -- smuggling pandas and killer whales, games of
   Russian Roulette, etc.  And how much does it cost to pay off the cops?

   Not to mention the cost of treating his various forms of VD ... Ughghhghggh


>> "I've been in show biz for 61 years ..."

This is longer than Krusty has been on TV, of course.  David Brunt explains:
   Remember that he would have had vaudeville, films and radio to work in. And
   children's parties ...

   Sid Ceasar, Jackie Gleason, Phil Silvers and Steve Allen all worked for a
   decade or more, honing their acts, before they first appeared on TV in the
   1950s.  TV was rather looked down on as the unwelcome cousin until the mid-
   late 1950s by many variety performers.


Haynes Lee:  Much like how the current entertainment industry views the
   internet.


Anthony Regina agrees:  Actually, the way I took it was that Krusty has been
   in the entertainment business for 50 years.  The Krusty special was
   celebrating his 29th year of "The Krusty the Klown Show".  If you notice in
   "Day of the Jackanapes" Krusty shows clips of his early career on other TV
   shows.  And the question of Krusty's age has always been the source of
   humor and mystery on the show. Personally I think he could very well be in
   his late 50's to early 60's and just be covering it up with clown makeup
   and plastic surgery.  I always thought of Krusty as a template for the
   comedian George Carlin, who is in his late mid 60's (I think), and still
   looks pretty good for his age.  Just my two cents though ... :)


>> Krusty's Age

 - and you thought Flanders and Burns' age changes were weird?

Daniel L. Dreibelbis:  When he announces his retirement, Krusty also mentions
   that "I've been in show business for 61 years".  If we take into
   consideration that Herschel Krustovsky started being a comedian when he was
   a little kid and would include his formative years before he went pro (as
   seen in "Like Father, Like Clown"), my guess is that Krusty is, at the very
   least,  66-69 years old.  Which of course also begs the question, how old
   is his dad Rabbi Krustovsky?  And has there ever been a previous mention of
   Krusty's age prior to this?


>> The Banana Splits

Joe Klemm:  The Banana Splits are a quartet of costumed characters from a
   Hanna-Barbera program that aired from 1968-1970 on ABC [{dld} says it's NBC
   -- Ed.], and then on syndication.  With the costumes done by Sid and Marty
   Krofft, the Splits consisted of Flebble, a dog, Bingo, a monkey, Drooper, a
   lion, and Snorky (Snork for short), an elephant.


>> Well, it was either that or part with the $3.99

Erasing historic tapes has a real-life precedent, according to Joe Klemm:  In
   the 1970's, the three major television networks were facing a problem: the
   vaults where they kept their programs has so many tapes that they were
   running out of space to store them in.  To solve this problem, the networks
   decided to do something that by today standards could be considered dumb
   depending on the object: they simply erased some of their programs to make
   room for other programs.  The programs that were erased ranged from
   episodes of TV shows (usually daytime fare, like game shows) to important
   event (the only color footage of John F. Kennedy's inauguration and the
   first Super Bowl).

   However despite these erasings, that doesn't mean a show is lost forever.
   An example of this took place last year, when someone discovered tapes
   containing the CBS run of the Jack Barry game show, The Joker's Wild,
   which, with the exception of the last season, was thought to have been lost
   due to erasure. These episodes, upon being cleaned up, are now being aired
   for the first time in almost thirty years on Game Show Network.

   was a piece on tapes the Museum of TV & Radio wishes it had, including
   Super Bowl I, lost when both NBC and CBS taped over it.


>> Seven Words You Can't Say On TV -- 1950's Edition

Jeff Cross:  Back in the 1930s Hollywood issued the Motion Picture Production
   Code (available at http://www.artsreformation.com/a001/hays-code.html) to
   govern what could and could not be filmed.  There also existed a forbidden
   word list: you couldn't say things like "alley cat," "bat," "nuts" when you
   weren't discussing insanity, "nerts," or the inexplicable "in your hat."
   Krusty's being censored for saying "pants" back in his first TV spot seems
   to jell with this.


>> "Those lousy shutters set me back another 22 years."

Daniel L. Dreibelbis explains where the balky shutter wall came from:
   ["Laugh-In" was] an NBC network comedy show that ran between 1968 and 1969,
   hosted by comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. Noted for rapid-fire gags
   and non-sequitirs, some of the gags involved the players popping out of
   doors in the wall and asking a riddle that would be answered by another
   player popping out another door.  A number of comedians got national
   recognition on the show, including Goldie Hawn, Ruth Buzzi, Lily Tomlin,
   and Arte Johnson (who Krusty was complaining to), and some other famous
   people appeared in cameos (among them Richard M. Nixon).

   (It would've been funnier, though to have had Krusty appear on its infamous
   sister show TURN-ON, which was yanked after one episode by ABC for being
   too raw, lewd and outright weird for 1969)


>> Coming Attractions

Mike Reed transcribes this episode's preview:

   Voice-Over: Springfield's most diabolical villain is back!
   Bob: This time I cannot fail!  (walks into rake)
   Voice-Over: Kelsey Grammer guest stars as Sideshow Bob.
   Bob: Have Bart kill Krusty.
   Voice-Over: Can nothing stop him?
   Lisa: Bart's a brainwashed killing machine!
   Homer: Eh, so was I at his age.
   Voice-Over: An all new Simpsons!

   [The killing-machine joke was not in the actual episode.  See the next item
   -- Ed.]


>> The cutting room floor

As it turns out, lots of other things were cut from this episode.  Jouni
   Paakkinen reports:  Thanks to Jonah's fantastic Springfield Shopper site,
   cuts which were made to the final "Day of the Jackanapes" script have been
   revealed.  Scroll down below to see them all.  Unfortunately, it seems as
   if The Simpsons' producers left out a bunch of hilarious moments.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Wiggum: "Hey Kent, are you guys still having that contest where we guess
   what city the weather girl's in?

   Kent: "That was eight years ago."

   Wiggum: "Is it Pittsburgh?"

   CUT OUT

   We see Wiggum's police cruiser drive behind him.  Nelson Muntz is at the
   wheel.

   Nelson: (Siren-like) Haw Haw!"

   Wiggum: "I should probably go."

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Sideshow Bob: (Aghast) "The first ten years?  Those are MY shows!  My
   classic clips, lost forever!"

   CUT OUT

   Krusty: (on TV) "Frankly Kent, it was no big loss.  Most shows don't really
   hit their stride till the twelfth season."

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   CUT OUT

   Bart: "You'll never get away with this, Bob.  When Skinner finds out I'm
   missing, he'll ... (realizing) ... What're you gonna do to me?"

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Marge: "Look!  Krusty invited us to the taping of his last episode."

   CUT OUT

   Lisa: "Well, I would hope so.  Bart & I got him out of jail."

   Homer: "And I helped him win his daughter back."

   Marge: "And don't forget I was Sideshow Marge."

   Marge's FLASHBACK

   Marge is dressed like Sideshow Mel, with a bone in her hair, standing on
   Krusty's stage.  She examines a pie as Krusty stands nearby.

   Marge: "This is such a lovely pie.  It would go great with a glass of
   milk."

   Krusty: "Just throw the damn thing!"

   BACK TO PRESENT

   Marge: "Oh, I let him have it.  Carefully sliced on a paper plate."

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   CUT OUT

   Kent: "And here comes Krusty's favorite cut-ups: Itchy and Scratchy.

   Itchy and Scratchy walk up, in tuxedos.

   Kent: "So what are you fellas gonna do, now that the show's over?"

   Scratchy: "We can finally reveal our deep, dark secret."

   Itchy: "We're lovers!"

   Kent GASPS.

   Itchy: "Of collectable plates."

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   CUT OUT

   Krusty: "Well, old pal ..."

   Sideshow Mel: "You're not my 'pal' ...!"

   Krusty: (confused noise)

   Mel: "In eight-and-a-half years, have you ever had me over to your house,
   even once?"

   Krusty: "Eh ... I was gonna call you next week."

   Mel: "Do you even know my last name?"

   Krusty: "Well I--(to Audience) Sideshow Mel, everyone!  Great bit!"

   Audience APPLAUDS.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------


And there was still more deleted material!  Fox Wolf writes:  Wow, I counted
   two whole scenes that were advertised that never made it

   Lisa: Oh no!  He's turned into a killing machine!

   Homer: Eh, so was I at his age.

   Really, Lisa?  Good thing they took that one out.  Then there's this one
   that was on the radio

   Sideshow Bob: [something]

   Bart: [hypnotic] Say it, don't spray it.

   [Rumor has it that some of this material was dropped to make way for Mr.
   Teeny's scenes.  Or maybe the producers were thinking ahead, and cooked up
   some "deleted scene" material for a future DVD! -- Ed.]


>> Prophecy

Joe Klemm was bold enough to predict:  The ending of the episode, where the
   cops plan to behead Bob, is a likely sign that this is meant to be the last
   Sideshow Bob episode on the show, which is a sign that "The Simpsons" is
   running on its last legs.

   [Bob evidently got a last-minute reprieve, for he returned two years later
   in "The Great Louse Detective (EABF01)." -- Ed.]


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this episode is:  Where the Jackelopes Play


Joe Green suggests:  Bart and Sideshow Bob Strike Back


Robin Steinmann:  [In Germany, this was called] "Hello, you little hypnosis-
   murderer."


According to Fox (by way of Bill LaRue), this episode scored a Nielsen rating
   of 8.8 (14 share).  This works out to 15.4 million viewers.  Among adults
   aged 18 to 49, the rating was 8.0 (20 share).

   "The Simpsons" was the highest rated prime program on television Sunday
   night among Adults 18-34, Men 18-34 and Women 18-34.


Chris Palm:  Oddly enough, I believe there was a question VERY similar to
   Moe's on WWTBAM a week or two ago.


David Plotkin:  Sideshow bob says the sarcastic middle-aged man's name is
   Rafael.  Is that going to be consistent with future episodes?


Benjamin Robinson:  Webster's dictionary defines a "mukluk" as being a boot
   worn by Alaskan Eskimos (or Inuit).  It's typically made of sealskin, with
   the fur side facing inward.

Virgil:	All right, Moe Szyslak!
Moe:	Yes, Virgil?
Virgil:	Yesterday, we asked if you wanted to risk it all for 
	500,000 dollars, and you stalled for twenty minutes.
Moe:	Yes, yes, I did.  I was told to.
Virgil:	Hey, that's great.  But now, we must have your answer in 
	the next ten or fifteen minutes.
	[a pretty model brings in a wheelbarrow full of cash]
	You want some of this?  [grabs some cash, and rubs it 
	against himself] Well, do ya?
Moe:	[calmly] I can honestly say I do.
Virgil:	All right, then.  For half a million dollars, which of the

Moe:	Oy.
Virgil:	[the answers appear on the screen as Virgil reads them]
	A) Proton

Homer:	Hello? ... Hey, Moe!  We're watching you on TV.
Moe:	Yeah, I know, Homer.
Homer:	So, how's that bowel obstruction doing?
Moe:	Homer, please, heh-heh ... I got a nuclear-type question

Homer:	Well, it all starts when a nulicule comes out of its nest.
Lisa:	[taking the phone] The answer is "bonbon!"
Moe:	Uh, I'm going to say, "bonbon."
Virgil:	Bonbon, eh, Moe?  Is that your ultimate response?
Moe:	Yuh-huh.
Virgil:	Oh, you are ... correct!

% slowly from the ceiling, and rests next to the original $500,000. 
% Somewhat uncharacteristically, Moe decides to play it safe and take
% the money.  The model lights the second wheelbarrow on fire to
% symbolize Moe's decision.  The audience cheers.
%
% There's no cheering at Krusty's studio, however.  He's meeting with
% some network executives about ways to spice up his show.

Krusty:		Eh, this quiz show crap is just a fad.
Executive:	Well, fad or not, it's here to stay.
Lindsey:	And it's killing your show in the ratings.
Krusty:		Hey, what do you want from me?  I do a kids' show.

Lindsey:	Without alienating anyone.

		tears it!  [to audience] Folks, I've been in show 
		biz for 61 years, but now these jerks have sucked 
		all the fun out.  I don't need twelve suits telling 
		me which way to pee.
Exec:		Uh, for "pee," could you substitute, "whiz?"

Exec:		I was just thinking that.
Krusty:		I can't take it any more!  Folks, don't miss this 
		Friday's show -- it'll be my last.

	"mukluk."  [Kent and Krusty share a laugh] Mukluk.
	[cut to Bob's cell in Springfield Penitentiary.  A small 
	TV shows the interview, while Bob reads a magazine]
	You like that?  No charge.  Mukluk.  [laughs] Mukluk ...
Bob:	Oh, can it, you tiresome tot-sitter.  I was the risible 
	one in our dyad.
Kent:	Ever watch the old episodes?
Krusty:	Oh, Kent, that's a sad story.  I taped over all my old 
	episodes.  Ah, you know, I had a thing for Judge Judy, and 
	blank tape was 3.99.  What would you do?
Bob:	[gasps] Those are my shows.
Krusty:	Frankly, Kent, those episodes were no big loss.  The show 
	didn't really get funny until we fired Sideshow Bob and 
	hired whose-its.
Bob:	You've erased my past!  Now, I'll erase your future.
	[a guard bangs on Bob's cell with a nightstick]

	walks, arms outstretched, towards the stage]
Bob:	Well, Krusty, this is your Waterloo.  Soon, you'll be 
	Napoleon Blown-apart.
Leo:	Ugh!  Terrible.
Bob:	Oh, hush up, Leo.
-- It was the perfect pun -- for revenge, "Day of the Jackanapes"

% Krusty continues.

Krusty:	You know, I'd like to thank God for all my success, even 
	though I never worshipped or believed in Him in any way.  
	But before I sweep up my last spotlight, there's one thing 
	I gotta say.  Over the years, I've [pantomimes toking a 
	joint] a lot of [stoned] "whoa."  And I've [sexual 
	thrusting] a lot of [pantomimes hourglass shape] a-ooga!  
	But there's one thing I'm ashamed of.
Bob:	Ashamed?
Krusty:	There was a man who used to work for me.  A man of grace 
	and humor, and I mistreated him and drove him to a life of 
	crime.  So wherever you are, I just wanna say:  Sideshow 
	Bob, I'm sorry.  [curtains behind Krusty part to reveal 
	Sideshow Bob's portrait]
	[to the tune of "Mandy"]
	Oh, Bob, you repaid my abuse with raw hatred
	But I need you today,
	Oh, Bob, well you went to Apu's and you framed me
	So they locked me away ...
Bob:	Oh, that sweet, funny man.
-- "Day of the Jackanapes"

% With horror, Bob notices his boy-bomb is still advancing on Krusty. 
% He rushes down to the stage.  Krusty has noticed the boy, but not
% the bomb, and prepares to hug him.  Mr. Teeny sees the situation
% unfold, and takes action.  Swinging down from the rafters, he grabs
% the bandoleer of plastic explosives off Bart's body.  The monkey
% runs to a door to dispose of the bomb, but it's the door to the
% network executive lounge.  Mr. Teeny hesitates a moment, but throws
% the explosives in anyway.  There is a resounding bang from inside
% the room.

Krusty:	What happened?  Was anyone hurt?
Mel:	Just some network executives.
	[we see the inside of the lounge, which has pools of 
	liquid metal scattered about.  Some of the pools gather 
	together to form one two-headed executive]
Exec:	[robotically] We have notes.  Have you thought about Dave 
	Chappelle?  Destroy!
-- "Day of the Jackanapes"

% Everyone who isn't a network executive celebrates at UGLI.  Marge
% gets everyone ready for a picture by telling them to say, "funny." 
% As she snaps the photo, everyone's face is distorted by saying the
% word.

Bob:	Krusty, I'm so sorry about the attempted murder.
Krusty:	Will you stop with the sorry?  Every time you try to kill 
	me, my ratings go through the roof, you nut!
Bob:	We are good together, Krusty.
Krusty:	It makes me sad that you're getting the death penalty.
Bob:	Ugh, don't remind me.
	[Wiggum, Eddie, and Lou wheel a guillotine up to the 
	table]
Wiggum:	Okay, where do you want to do this thing?
Bob:	Isn't it customary to have a trial?
Wiggum:	Oh, a wise guy, eh?
-- Final score:  Bart 7, Bob 0, "Day of the Jackanapes"
