> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
===============================================================================
Chief Wiggum's badge disappears when he's speaking on the radio.  {dh}

If the series shown was "COPS", shouldn't the camera be shaky?  {rl}

A piece of paper moves around the kitchen table.  In one shot, it
disappears.  {dh}

The car's engine seems to be switched off, yet Homer drives off after
speaking to the gas station attendant.  {dh}

The bacon and eggs switches color when there's a bug on it.  {rl}

When Homer drives behind Hans Moleman, they're driving uphill during
exterior shots.  In the interior shots of their cars, they aren't.  {jt}

Isn't Hans too short for his feet to reach the pedals?  {jt}

Burns shadow is botched during one scene.  {dh}

The desk clock vanishes when Homer stand before Burns' desk.  {dh}

The clock changes times and form between scenes.  {rl}

Smithers moves before Burns commands him to bring Homer to him.  {dh}

The chairs in Burns' office vanish when Homer has his heart attack.
{dh}

One of the attendants disappears from the ambulance en route to the
hospital.  {dh}

Marge shouldn't be able to reach the kitchen phone while she is sitting
down.  {dh}

SLH disappears while the family discusses Homer's operation.  {dh}

At one point after the puppet show, Homer's shadow doesn't follow his
movements.  {dh}

The electrodes attached to Homer's chest seem to move around and aren't
attached to anything.  {dh}

The "NO PRAYING" sign only appears when the nurse pointed at it.  Also,
at the beginning of this scene, the door to the room appears to be
closed -- the nurse couldn't have heard Homer praying.  {dh}

The bed's remote control seems to have disappeared during Krusty's
visit.  {dh}

Where are Krusty's cattle skull birth mark and his famous superfluous
nipple that we saw in 8F24?  And consider his line, "This ain't make-up"
even when he clearly wiped it off in 7F18.  {jt}

After Marge calls the kids, her chair vanishes.  {dh}

When Lenny and Carl give Homer the card and Homer takes it, for one
frame, "EMERGENCY PROCEDURE DO NOT REMOVE" reads "DO NOT PRMOVE".  {jt}

Some of the nurses disappear during the operation.  {dh}

Dr. Riviera isn't wearing a wristwatch at the beginning of the
operation, so he couldn't have gotten it stuck in Homer.  {dh}

Homer's bandages seem to cover his neck more than they do his chest.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Michael Carrington

One of the writers of this episode was Michael Carrington, who normally
    works as a producer and writer for "Martin", notes Ricardo Lafaurie.

>> Ms.  Albright's teachings

Juha Terho writes, "`If he's been good, he'll go to heaven.  In heaven,
    you get to do whatever you like best.'  Not true.  This is explained
    in the 7F13 capsule."

>> What Marge heard on the phone

Juha Terho says, "We hear only Marge's side of the phone conversation
    where she learns that Homer has had a heart attack.  As she answers
    the phone, she says: `Yes?  [one-second pause] Oh my Lord!  [to
    Patty & Selma] Homer's in the hospital, they think it's his heart!'
    
    The caller on the other end probably said something to the effect of
    "This is so-and-so from Springfield Memorial Hospital.  Your husband
    has probably had a heart attack.  I think you'd better come and see
    him" -- all that in one second?
    
    (There's a similar scene in 7F16 where Homer learns that Grampa has
    had a heart attack.)"

>> The word "Hell"

Juha Terho asks rhetorically, "Isn't the word `hell' used a little too
    liberally in this episode?"  He lists the following examples:

    - Homer: "What the hell is this?"
    - Barney: "What the hell am I supposed to do with this jumbo thong
      bikini?"
    - Dr. Nick: "What the hell is that?"
    - Moe: "Hell no."
    - Customer: "Oh, what the hell, yes."

>> Recycled animation

The ambulance shot where Homer is being rushed to the hospital is reused
    from 7F24, and both look very similar to the scene in 7F01.
