   [If you use these summaries to determine if you found the right capsule,
   here's a TV Guide-like synopsis:  Troy McClure hosts this special episode,
   featuring three possible "Simpsons" spin-offs -- "Chief Wiggum, P. I.",
   "The Love-Matic Grampa", and "The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour".

Couch:          Not this week -- we just go directly to Troy McClure's
                introduction.

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... Tim Conway runs off and doesn't participate in the pillow fight?
   ... practically nobody on a.t.s. correctly remembered the name of "The
       Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour"?

Dale G. Abersold:
   ... this is the first episode directed by Neil Affleck?
   ... One of the musicians shown when Homer is in the orchestra pit looked
       like a caricature of ["Simpsons" music director Alf] Clausen?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Chief Wiggum is no longer married in the spinoff?
   ... Chief Wiggum is first seen driving on the wrong side of the road?
   ... Ralph is "playing the spoons" by banging the backs of the spoons
       together?
   ... the gorilla head at the Mardi Gras looks like "King Homer" from the
       third Halloween special?
   ... Lisa's Mardi Gras outfit has spiked hair like her real hair?  ({mss}
       adds that it has "pearls," as well)
   ... the bulbs on the right side of the Love Tester light up higher than the
       ones on the left side?
   ... somebody put an electric outlet on a wall of urinals?
   ... new Lisa is a "sophomore prom queen five years running", a reference to
       both Lisa being older and not aging?
   ... in the beaver sketch, when they fall over, Maggie is the only one not
       to close her eyes?
   ... in the ending scene in the bed, Maggie's bow is red?

John C. Hallyburton, Jr.:
   ... When Marge and Homer are alone onstage during "The Simpson Family
       Smile-Time Variety Hour", Marge looks straight at the camera, as if
       reading the teleprompter?  Homer, on the other hand, looks left and
       right and delivers his lines as if he had memorized and rehearsed them.

Jason Hancock:
   ... the Fox programming schedule's times are Eastern?
   ... the program guide has only OFF, the X-Files, and Melrose Place?  (No
       King of the Hill or Millennium, and even the just recently canceled
       Married ... With Children was left off the schedule.)
   ... Wiggum is credited as "Chief" (as opposed to "Clancy") Wiggum?
   ... Ralph's eyes are crossed as he plays the spoons?
   ... Wiggum doesn't know his own son's age?
   ... the above-ground graves in the cemetery?  (See "Comments and
       Observations" below)
   ... the painting of a horse-mounted man holding a Confederate flag inside
       the governor's mansion?
   ... the cupid in the "Love-Matic Grampa" opening sequence looks a little
       like Homer?
   ... the "COLLEGE" pennant at Moe's?
   ... the clock at the opening of the "Simpsons Smile-Time Variety Hour"
       reads 8:20?
   ... OFF wears bell-bottoms during the "Smile-Time Variety Hour?"
   ... Marge wears a poodle skirt during the soda fountain sketch?
   ... the Generic Teenager behind the counter at the soda fountain?

Darrel Jones:
   ... all the shows Troy McClure passes on the walls are for spinoffs?  (See
       "Comments" section for more)
   ... Lisa only speaks one line the whole episode (during "Chief Wiggum
       P.I.")?  [That's two shows in a row where she has little to do -- Ed.]
   ... the scene during the opening sequence where Wiggum's nose is bitten by
       a lobster looks like an outtake from the restaurant scene?
   ... Skinner has not been in New Orleans in 42 years, no if his age of 44
       from [4F09] is correct, he left when he was only two?
   ... Skinner is a stamp collector?
   ... Betty ate escargot?  [Or threw them at Moe, at least -- Ed.]
   ... the Lisa impersonator is at least 20 years old?
   ... the Simpsons' original theme is incorporated at the end of the theme
       song?
   ... all the "Springfield Baggy-Pants Players" appear dressed in candy
       outfits at the end of the "I Want Candy" production?

Joe Klemm:
   ... this is the first episode since Treehouse of Horrors II to not have a
       couch gag?
   ... Wiggum's voice when he was on the boat?
   ... the Cupid in the Love-Matic Grandpa sketch resembles Homer a little
       bit?
   ... Maggie didn't faint when she saw the skunk?
   ... Maggie doesn't have a pacifier in the beaver sketch?

Haynes Lee:
   ... Chief Wiggum fires double-barrel shotguns more than twice?
   ... Skinner at corner of Camp & Lafayette?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... the guy Skinner is with in the "Chief Wiggum, P.I." opening appears to
       be "the son of the guy who played Huggy Bear" on Starsky and Hutch?
   ... Chief Wiggum and Ralph are listed in the "opening credits" not by their
       full names?
   ... Wiggum is a really bad shot?
   ... Skinner is not only Wiggum's working partner, he's _living_ with him,
       too?
   ... Ralph is only 10, yet his hair is thinning?
   ... Ralph never seems frightened despite being kidnapped by a strange man?
   ... how calm and chalant the woman acts despite being in a car accident?
   ... the music for the establishing shot of Le Snotterie sounds very
       60s'ish?
   ... how odd it would be that Fox would program a 70s-era variety hour for
       their primetime schedule?
   ... the little green alien says "Damn straight" the same way Jake the
       Barber does in 8F11?
   ... the transparent Fox logo disappears after the Executive Producer
       credits begin instead of before?

Dallas J. Pesola:
   ... the Superdome in the New Orleans skyline?
   ... the clock in the diner read the same time as the real time of this show
       (8:26pm EDT)?

Jonathan Pierce:
   ... the big Mardi Gras parade was not even heard a little before Chief
       Wiggum and Skinny Boy opened up the windows?
   ... when Lisa tells Wiggum that she can't wait to hear about all the
       exciting and sexy adventures, everybody's eyes are on her except Marge?
   ... when "Grandpa" talks to Moe at first, the lights don't flicker, but
       later in the episode, they do?
   ... when the "The End" pink end screen shows up in "The Love-Matic
       Grandpa", there is the Roman numeral date under the angel?
   ... the audience laughs 6 times and makes weird noises 3 times?
   ... during the "I Want Candy" song, a waiter in the background tosses Bart,
       "Lisa", and Homer their hats?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... the schedule ignores "King of the Hill" at 8:30 to 9:00 on Sunday?
   ... the tires on Chef Prudhomme's cart were flattened?
   ... Grampa is trying to get a can of figs when he meets his maker.
   ... nobody seems to object -- or even notice -- that Moe's date goes into
       the men's' room?
   ... in the "upcoming season" stills, Homer turns Lisa into a frog?  (She
       doesn't look too happy about it, either.)

Brian F. Satterwhite:
   ... Troy's line about the show being for "Simpsons fans ... if any" in the
       introduction?

Marge Starbrod-Simpson:
   ... Cops and AMW, which have occupied the Saturday 8-9 timeslot forever and
       can't seem to be replaced, aren't on the chart?
   ... this ep was most likely written after "Martin" and "Married with
       Children" were canned?
   ... Smithers actually did a spinoff _sans Burns_ (and liked it)?

Harrison Stark:
   ... when Homer jumps on the table, he knocks a glass off?

Johnny Veitch:
   ... when Moe suggests "Ain't flowers stupid" as sweet talk Grampa does NOT
       disagree with it?
   ... Bart Beaver has a slingshot?

        Compare this to Lisa's absence from the show  {ddg}

   + Radio City Music Hall (concert venue)  {bjr}
      - Springfield has the similarly-named Radio City Music Room

   ~ "Archie" comics  {dj}

   + "The Flintstones" (TV series)
      - Ozmodiar is a near-clone of the Great Gazoo (see Comments section for
        why that's significant)

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  A trio of well-matched spoofs of such television staples as
   the detective show, the stupid sex comedy, and the variety show.  No one
   will write "I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me" about this one, but
   they might well write "I laughed, I laughed, I lost control of my bladder."
   Finest moment: Smithers' version of "Crack that Whip."  (A)

Joseph Barder:  Overall, a very weird episode, that runs along the same theme
   as the 138th episode spectacular.  The "Wiggum P.I." and "Grandfather Love
   Machine" sketches were mostly funny, but the "Simpsons Variety Hour" sketch
   succeeded in parodying old variety shows too well.  By parodying an awful
   show, it became near unwatchable.  The best scenes in the whole show were
   the plans for the future thing at the end, with the obvious Flintstone
   parody.  Would have been better if it was about actual possible spinoffs,
   like the rumored ones they always mention of Lisa and Maggie's future
   years.  (B)

Richard Bunnell:  I assume that this ep will get mixed reviews, but I loved
   it!  It had plenty of funny jokes (such as the Simpsons tacked-on cameos in
   the first two spinoffs, and the canned laughter in the Love-Matic Grandpa).
   But the thing that topped the ep off with humor was definitely the
   "Simpsons Spin-off Showcase!"  The Lisa replacement was a funny idea, and I
   liked how it was a total parody of Laugh-In. "Whip!  Licorice Whip!"  (A+)

Jesse D. Burgheimer:  This episode was, as Dr. Hibbert might say, "Riotously
   satirical!  I wonder if anyone ELSE got that?"  Nothing could have been
   more on target than the sketches within the "Spin-off Spectacular," more
   specifically the parodies of Magnum P.I. (and other cop shows) in "Chief
   Wiggum, P.I.", parodies of such ribald "Fox network" type sitcoms in
   "Love-Matic Grandpa", and parodies of the ludicrously cornball variety
   shows in "The Simpsons Good-Time Variety Hour."
      I could go on... but why?  These shorts made well-deserved jabs at
   half-assed television shows in the past few decades which tried desperately
   to be entertaining.  There may even be a poke at previous Simpson producers
   Al Jean and Mike Reiss who left OFF to work on such works of art as
   "Homeboys in Outer Space" on UPN.  (A)

Vince Chan:  This episode had plot.  It seems like episodes that are divided
   into three distinct stories (i.e. THOH) are better than episodes that have
   one main plot throughout the show.  This episode has been the best one in
   the 4F series.  The jokes were great and the music made it even better.
   Cons to this episode?  The Simpsons dropping into "Wiggum P.I." and Homer
   dropping into "The Love Matic Grampa" The order of the acts, from best to
   worst is, 3rd, 1st, 2nd.  (A-)

Don Del Grande:  Some things just aren't meant to be spoofed, and two of them
   are "My Mother the Car" and "The Brady Bunch Variety Hour".  It didn't help
   matters that each spinoff was limited to seven minutes, so they couldn't
   develop much of a storyline.  (C)

Cara Frame:  I think this was a horrible episode, probably the worst in
   Simpsons history. It was hardly funny, and not interesting.  The first
   story with Chief Wiggum's might have been the best of them all.  It had
   remotely funny jokes, and made me laugh once or twice.  The second one,
   with Grampa as the love testing machine was worse.  The story was plotless,
   and really unlikable.  The last and final one was the worst.  It was not
   funny, it was not amusing, it was not interesting.  Personally, I would
   have rather had been watching reruns.  Grade:  (F)

Jason Hancock:  I liked this one -- it may sound like a paradox, but I thought
   it was funny _because_ it was lame.  In other words, I'm glad that these
   spin-offs won't really surface on Fox anytime soon.  Individually, I would
   have to say "The Love-Matic Grampa" was the best segment, followed by
   "Chief Wiggum P.I." and "The Simpsons Smile-Time Variety Hour."  (A-)

Ryan Johnson:  In answer to the question, "How you do you keep the Simpsons
   fresh after 8 long seasons?", you don't.  Let's not drag it through the mud
   here guys.  Like many episodes this season, it's funny for about 2 minutes,
   then it degrades into absurd, outlandish jokes that are hard to follow and
   not particularly funny.  If they had ended the show with "Summer of 4' 2" I
   would have been pretty upset, but after seeing most of season 8, I'd say
   it's time to put OFF to rest.  Let's hope that the season finale is a
   little better than this.  (D+)

Joe Klemm:  Chief Wiggum P.I.: A-.  A good way to start the episode.  It was
   great to see Ralph as one of the stars of the sketch.  In fact, the Ralph
   playing spoons scene had me ROTFL.
      Love-Matic Grandpa: B+.  Liked the opening theme and animation used in
   it. However, I thought it could have been more interesting that the other
   two.
      The Simpsons Family Smile-Time Variety Hour: A. Though it lacked some
   references to other Sid and Marty Krofft programs, it was a clever and cute
   sketch.  If my brothers were watching this, then they would like it as
   well.  (A)

Ondre Lombard:  Troy McClure was wasted, and added a less realistic look at
   the entire eight-year run, but didn't bother me.  Chief Wiggum, P.I. was
   slow, had an odd pairing and the Simpsons cameo was a waste of time, in my
   opinion.  A few good laughs, but nothing brilliant.  The Love Matic Grampa
   was cute, and the laugh/reaction track use is hilarious when it's not being
   used seriously. Sketchy in a few spots, but satisfying.  The Simpson Family
   Smile-Time Variety Hour was good, and since I can't figure out what would
   make it any better, I won't complain.  Overall grade:  (B-)

Jeff Reis:  This episode was written by people who obviously have both an
   awestruck admiration and a healthy disdain for television and its history,
   and the whole thing worked because it *knew* that a lot of it was lame.  It
   was the same kind of (for lack of a better term) "anti-comedy" comedy as
   that practiced by David Letterman (who, with good guests and writing is
   still more funny than not despite what EW would have you believe), The
   State, et al.--right up my alley. Grade:  (A-)

Jim Scheppke:  I laughed my head off, especially at the cartoon at the
   beginning of Love-Matic Granpa.  This was an imaginative, well written
   episode - perhaps the best this season.  Through all this praise, though,
   they could have done better than that supermodel - type teen as Lisa's
   replacement in The Simpson Family Smile Time Comedy Hour - maybe they could
   have used the Estonian midget from "Burns' Heir."  (A-)

Marge Starbrod-Simpson:  I can't say I wasn't disappointed, but I can say that
   there wasn't much need for me to turn off the TV and VCR in disgust.
   "Chief Wiggum, P.I." was one of the funniest bits this season (Grade: A).
   "The Love-Matic Grandpa" was saved from failure by the opening sequence and
   the brief appearances of Jimbo, Dolph, Kearny, and Homer.  No, I didn't
   like the canned laughter.  (Grade: D+)  "The Simpson Family Smile-Time
   Variety Hour" was saved from mediocrity by the candy medley (Grade: B-).
   Again, Troy McClure makes a great host for a Simpsons special.  And we knew
   that the preview of next season was fake, right?  Overall grade:  (C+)

Nancy Walls:  This episode was great!  "Chief Wiggum P.I." was a little
   predictable, but "The Love-Matic Grandpa" and "The Simpson Family Goodtime
   Variety Hour" were pretty good, and so was Troy McClure.  I hope to see
   more episodes like this.
      [Ms. Walls also says, "I hope to see my review in "The Simpsons Spinoff
   Showcase" capsule in a few months."  Ha!  -- Ed.]  Grade:  (A-)

Yours Truly:  A relentlessly industry-referential episode; but the attacks on
   the industry aren't quite as sharp as in "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie
   Show (4F12)."  it gets better as it goes along.  "Chief Wiggum, P.I." is
   so-so, but I loved the ersatz, so-bad-it's-good variety show finale.  The
   episode's second segment deftly shows he stark contrast between "The
   Simpsons," and the run-of-the-mill sitcom.  Assuming Fox doesn't get any
   clever ideas about <actually> spinning these shows off,  (B+)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B (3.05)   Std Dev.: 1.1550   (21 reviews computed)

>> Writer Watch

Dale G. Abersold:  David S. Cohen's previous efforts include "Lisa the
   Vegetarian", "Much Apu About Nothing", "Homer^3" (from ToH VI); and from
   this season, "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" and "Citizen Kang" from
   ToH VII.

   Dan Greaney's resume includes "King-Size Homer", "Summer of 4 Ft. 2", "The
   Genesis Tub" (from ToH VII), and "My Sister, My Sitter."

   Steve Tompkins has only two other episodes to his name.  "Nightmare on
   Evergreen Terrace" from ToH VI, and "A Milhouse Divided".


>> Guest Voices

 - (Wakko voice): But where's Don Knotts?

Dale G. Abersold:  Tim Conway first gained fame on television, first as part
   of Steve Allen's troupe (along with Louis Nye, Tom Poston, and Don Knotts),
   then on "McHale's Navy", and finally as one of Carol Burnett's troupe.
   During the 1970's and 80's, he appeared in many Disney and Disneyesque
   movies, usually paired with Don Knotts.  What can one say about these
   movies?  Well, Lemmon and Matthau they ain't.  The late 80's and 90's have
   not been kind to Conway, who has received recognition mostly for his
   various "Dorf" videos. Look for him this summer in "Speed 2: Cruise
   Control."


 - We put the "fat" in "fat southern sheriffs"

Dale G. Abersold:  Character actor Gailard Sartain is a fixture in many films
   with a southern setting, from the horrible (the "Ernest" movies) to the
   respected ("The Big Easy" and "Mississippi Burning").


>> Up next on Fox ... a blank screen!

Haynes Lee comments Fox's exciting new schedule:  These frames [showing Fox's
   sparse schedule] must have been made before "King of the Hill" finally
   filled in the 8:30 Sunday night slot (remember the "House of Buggin,"
   yech!).  Also listed was the "X-Files" Sundays 9:00pm and "Melrose Place"
   Mondays 8:00pm.  Conspicuous by its absence is the recently cancelled
   "Married ... With Children."


>> Well, I suppose it beats "Archie Bunker's Place"

Benjamin Robinson:  This is the sort of thing that can only happen in TV land.
   After "The Brady Bunch" wrapped up in 1974, some brilliant soul said, "Hey!
   I've got an idea!  Let's have a show where the Bradys move to another city,
   buy an ice rink, and put on a weekly variety show."  Of course, he was
   immediately hauled away to the funny farm, and never heard from again.  No,
   wait!  This is Hollywood, remember?  The network executives thought this
   was a good idea.  They couldn't convince the rest of the country of this,
   though, and the program was quickly canceled.  Later, as the Bradys went
   through various spin-offs, TV movies, and series revivals, they made no
   mention of this phase of their lives.  After watching a part of the show, I
   can see why; it's one of the oddest ideas television, along with "My Mother
   the Car," and "The CBS Evening News with Dan Rather."  It seems most
   fitting that Lisa, as the smartest and most artistically aware Simpson,
   would be the one who would not want to be associated with this.


>> Spin-Offs:  The practical alternative to creativity

Benjamin Robinson gives us the spin-off run-down:  The spin-off is one of
   television's long-standing traditions.  Troy McClure's cynical description
   of how the process works is pretty close to the mark:  A supporting
   character (or even a one-shot guest character) on a popular show is given a
   show of his or her own, in the hopes that lightning will strike twice.
   Usually, it doesn't.  However, there have been enough successful spin-offs
   to encourage TV producers to keep trying.

   The walls of the Museum of TV and Television were decorated with posters
   commemorating spin-offs of the past.  They are, in order of appearance

   "The Ropers" - Spun off from "Three's Company."  The landlord and his wife
   move into a new apartment, complete with snooty next-door neighbor.  It
   lasted about a season, if that.

   "Laverne & Shirley" - Spun off from "Happy Days" (which itself was based on
   a "Love, American Style" segment called "Love and the Happy Day").  Laverne
   and Shirley were both dates for Richie and the Fonz.  The characters were
   created for that one show, but something clicked, and they were given their
   own slot right after "Happy Days."  The show was an immediate hit, rivaling
   its parent program in the Nielsen ratings.

   "Fish" - Short-lived comedy featuring Abe Vigoda's character from "Barney
   Miller."

   "Rhoda" - A spin-off of "The Mary Tyler Moore" show, taking the Rhoda
   Morganstern character to the Big Apple.  Rhoda got married, and the wedding
   episode was one of the biggest rating draws at the time.  The audience
   tapered off quickly after that, though, and the show was eventually
   canceled.  To this day, critics use "Rhoda" as a warning about the hazards
   of marrying off a series' lead character.  If the show is built around a
   single (in the marital sense) person, the audience may perceive the party
   is over -- and leave -- when the character gets hitched.  (Fans of "The
   Simpsons" may be interested in knowing that Julie "voice of Marge" Kavner
   played Rhoda's younger sister.)

   "The Jeffersons" - Archie Bunker's equally loudmouthed neighbor, George
   Jefferson, moved on up to a series of his own.  Its tone of humor was
   broader and less satirical than "All in the Family" but it too was a hit,
   enduring for several years.

   Television critics point to the spin-off as being a symptom of Hollywood's
   chronic lack of creativity.  It's true that most spin-offs are even less
   remarkable that their parent shows, but sometimes lightning really <does>
   strike twice.  Consider this:  "The Simpsons" is itself a spin-off, having
   gotten its start as a series of short clips on "The Tracey Ullman Show."


>> And you thought they just built them for chase scenes

Jason Hancock:  You may have noticed some strange-looking graves in New
   Orleans during the "Chief Wiggum, P.I." segment.  In New Orleans, dead
   bodies are buried _above_ the ground since the city is located below sea
   level.


Patrick and Cathy Moore explains why this is so:  It is actually illegal to
   bury a deceased person in New Orleans.  The whole city is below sea level,
   so the only way to ensure one's final resting place is to place them in a
   mausoleum, or tomb.  This is because the ground is so moist that wooden
   caskets would decay very quickly, and steel caskets would rust apart.
   Concrete vaults would not help either, because they cannot be hermetically
   sealed.


>> The Great Ozmodiar

Dave Hall provides some useful background information:  For those who watched
   tonight's episode (May 11th), may remember towards the end, Troy's remark
   about a friendly green alien joining the show... appeared to be an inside
   joke.

   FYI, snipped from an old Matt Groening interview...

   "It has been suggested by a network goon that we add some spice to the
   Simpson family by adding another character.  I'm resisting this with all my
   might.  However, if a genie or little friendly alien comes to live with the
   Simpsons sometime soon, you'll know I failed."


Haynes Lee adds:  This was mentioned by someone who wrote to BONGO comics
   concerning the upcoming 167th episode.  The reader pointed out that the
   Flintstones started to go downhill when the Great Gazoo showed up in the
   last few seasons.  The reader sarcastically pointed out The Simpsons will
   no longer be worth watching a Gazoo-like being (Ozmodiar) appeared.

   [Jason Hancock writes that Gazoo was voiced by Harvey Korman, a frequent
   comic partner to Tim Conway -- Ed.]


Michael Adams:  This is starting to worry me...first that Roy character, and
   now a Gazoo reference.  Are the writers trying to tell us something?  I'd
   get increasingly worried if

   1) Santa's Little Helper gets a mini-great dane companion that runs around
   yelling "let me at 'em, I'll splat 'em!"

   2) A long-lost goofy cousin appears with a page-boy haircut and glasses,
   and is about as annoying as #1, above

   3) Bart goes off to college, Homer becomes a high-school teacher, and Ted
   McGinley becomes a supporting character.

   4) Dionne Warwick sings the theme, a dance-troupe called the Mermaids does
   one number a show, and Ted McGinley becomes a supporting character.

   5) The Flanders' are replaced by a stuttering old man wearing cheap leisure
   suits who thinks Homer's gay.

   6) Marge dies, Homer takes over Moe's bar, calling it "Homer Simpsons'
   Place"

   7) The Simpsons win the lottery.

   8) The kids leave school and the Simpsons buy a store selling tacky knick-
   knacks (George Clooney guest-stars).

   9) Homer gets pregnant and has a full-grown boy.

   and, of course

   10) The Korean War ends.  Barney, Reverend Lovejoy, and Mr. Burns star in
   "AfterSimpsons"


>> They Don't Call It The Big Easy For Nothing

Jeff Cross explains why Chief Wiggum and New Orleans are a good fit:  New
   Orleans and Louisiana have almost always been associated with crime and
   loose ethics.  In 1998 the entire New Orleans Police Department was
   discovered to be on the take.  As for the crack about the stolen governor's
   mansion, that's a reference to the reign of Huey Long, who turned Louisiana
   into a virtual police state and stole a large -- and still unrecovered --
   amount of money from the treasury.


>> The Eternal Threads

 - Is Smithers Gay?

Dale G. Abersold:  After the "Licorice Whip" bit, anyone who denies Smithers
   is gay probably doesn't believe "Ellen" is gay, either.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Simpsons Ripoff Showcase


Don Del Grande:  Although "Sanford & Son & Son" was not a real show, "Sanford
   & Son" had three real spinoffs: "Grady", "Sanford Arms", and "Sanford".


Darrel Jones:  The fat man who said "I guaron-tee it!" in the restaurant was
   Paul Prudhomme, a gourmet specializing in Cajun Dishes and nicknamed the
   "Ragin' Cajun".  And yes, he is overweight too.


Haynes Lee:  Laugh tracks were very popular in the 1960s and 1970s but most
   shows dropped them in the 1980s for a more spontaneous live audience. A
   notable hold-out was "M*A*S*H."


Dallas Pesola notes:  "I Guarantee" is Justin Wilson's catch-phrase, rather
   than Chef Paul Prudhomme's.


Marge Starbrod-Simpson:  Is it just me, or does Steve Tompkins seem to do
   better writing part of an episode instead of a full episode?  His only full
   episode was "A Millhouse Divided" (4F04), the worst episode ever in my
   book.  However, he did pretty good with the "Nightmare on Evergreen
   Terrace" bit in TOHVI (3F04), whatever he contributed to "22 Short Films
   About Springfield" (3F18), and "The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour"
   in this ep.


>> Phil Hartman, 1948 - 1998

Chances are, you've already head that Phil Hartman, the voice of lawyer Lionel
   Hutz and actor/spokesperson Troy McClure is no longer with us.  Over the
   years, Hartman had a broad and varied career:  supporting parts in movies,
   improv comedy with the Groundlings troupe, screenwriting (he co-wrote "Pee-
   Wee's Big Adventure"), and even a stint as a graphic artist.  Today, he's
   principally known for his work on "Saturday Night Live," "NewsRadio," and
   of course, "The Simpsons."  Sadly, his career was cut short when he was
   shot and killed in his Encino, California home.

   Don Smith wrote on the occasion of Mr. Hartman's passing, summarizing what
   it was about his best-known work that made him such an excellent comic
   actor.  I'm going to step aside now and let him take over

   I think Phil was this incredible workhorse, a strong foundation for comedy
   which was the rock solid base of NewsRadio and his years on Saturday Night
   Live.  Phil's talent stemmed from being able to do truly funny characters,
   but not in a way that they would get burnt-out or overused.  These were
   subtle straight-man style characters, yet they were providing the humor.
   Phil relied on re-occurring motifs and not the catch-phrases which rocket
   people to quick stardom and quick demise (except, possibly for the "you may
   remember me from such" lines which intro'd most Troy McClure appearances).
   Phil had the subtle timing and mild-mannerisms of a Jack Benny.  His career
   was slowly growing in a way that was enviable to most actors.  Phil
   Hartman's career would never burn out like some 20 year old kid with a
   goofy dance and a catchphrase.  He was the kind of middle-aged person that
   made me realize as a teenager that turning 30 (or 40 or 50) wouldn't be the
   end of the world.

   Seriously.  As NewsRadio's Bill MacNeal he was funny, yet the humor was
   derived from his weaselly demeanor and strange outlook on life.  He was, as
   often described, a 1990s Ted Baxter (Mary Tyler Moore).  Andy Dick relies
   way too heavily on being a spazzy character- You know he is annoying as
   many people as he's entertaining.  I don't think the same could be said of
   Phil. Bill MacNeal became a comedic barb in the side of straight-man "Dave
   Nelson" then turned around and was the sarcastic straight-man to "Matthew."
   Phil had a broad talent that could fill in the comedic nooks and crannies
   of an ensemble cast like so much butter on some particular brand of English
   muffins.

   On The Simpsons he was less-exhibited, but still crucial as 2 strong
   secondary characters, blindly following their dreams despite continued
   failure, being passed up, and generally untalented.  As both Lionel Hutz,
   the lawyer (one-part sad alcoholic pathos, one-part ambulance-chasing
   shyster) and especially Troy McClure, (failed character actor turned
   pitchman) Phil wove the voices of two men hell-bent on their own
   destruction.  Not knowing when to quit, they continued on in the face of
   failure after failure.  But they were never conquering heroes, because
   inside we knew their failures were their own fault.  Phil had a way with
   the millstone chrs, Phil had a way that made us laugh and hate and pity his
   chrs at once.  I am unaware of another actor who can dish out hate and
   pathos in the same comedic nutshell.

   As Max Jerome, long distance phone pitchman, Phil swept the user into a
   world of intrigue and danger in a matter of 5-10 seconds.  Conceivably this
   is the only character my parents would recognize- thus what he would be
   remembered as.  Phil became accurately retro, delivering lines that were
   believably hard-boiled, but with the ironic twist which defined the early-
   mid-90s.  His similarly retro Cap'n Carl from the LA stage version of the
   Pee-Wee Herman show (circa 1982) which transported me back to the various
   kids' TV hosts before such nostalgia was commonplace.

   However, Phil Hartman will be eulogized for his portrayal of various
   characters on Saturday Night Live.  Un-Frozen Caveman Lawyer (probably the
   smartest portrayal of identity politics in the judiciary ever.  Phil's
   skewering of lawyers puts Seinfeld's Jackie Childs character to shame.  A
   character so well-crafted that a Spanish-language skit got more laughs than
   an English one), Frank Sinatra (a portrayal out of the pages of Kitty
   Kelly's "His Way," Phil's Sinatra was nine-tenths McLaughlin (sp?) Group,
   showing the Chairman as a commanding old-timer stuck in a world he couldn't
   relate to), his Frankenstein brought out the foibles in our icons, his
   President Clinton was the best in the business, His Ed MacMahon was more
   MacMahon than MacMahon himself.  He could be sitting by God's side right
   now, wittily remarking, "Yesss ... You are correct sir!"  (my mistake,
   second catchphrase Phil was involved with).  Coincidentally his Jesus
   opposite Jerry Seinfeld's Elijah (sp?) the Prophet was right on in the
   rerun 2 weeks ago.  Depending on your beliefs he could be trying it out
   right now (perhaps he had a good Buddha impersonation from the Groundlings
   which he never used on SNL?).  While the young comedians on SNL danced
   around with crazy catchphrases, Phil held up the building, Phil made the
   silly skit realistic, Phil was the every-adult 40-something chr that was an
   implausible parody to the other 20-yr-olds in make-up.

   I will remember Phil making some sarcastic remark and smiling
   disingenuously, letting the audience in on his deceit while trying to keep
   the character straight- that was Phil to me.

   Phil would have been one of the premiere character actors of the next 20
   years.  I would have expected to see him show up as the smarmy politician,
   crotchety cynical old man, or simply "guy behind the counter" in movies
   between now and the year 2025.  But his career won't last until 2025, it
   ended today May 28, 1998.

Wiggum:   [shouting into the night]  Listen up, Big Daddy!  You don't

Wiggum:   Oh, God!

Wiggum:    [picking up the phone]  Who is this?
Skinner:   It's me, chief.  I'm on the other extension.
Big Daddy: Now you listen up mon ami, and you listen good, hear?  The
           name's Daddy, Charles Daddy.
Wiggum:    Big Daddy!  What have you done with my boy, Daddy?
Big Daddy: Ah, the boy is fine -- so far.  I taught him to play the
           spoons.
           [Ralph blissfully tries to play the spoons with his nose]
           If you ever want to see that boy again, I suggest you leave

Wiggum:    [hangs up]  Sounds like there was some kind of party going
           on in the background.  Are there any parties today,
           Skinner.?
Skinner:   Eh.  Not really a party town.  Though if I remember

Bart:      Mardi Gras, man.  When the Big Easy calls, you gotta accept

Wiggum:    Well golly, I'd love to chat but my son's been kidnapped.

           the ages of six and ten, thinning hair.
Homer:     Over there.  [points to the crowd, where Big Daddy and
           Ralph are]
Ralph:     Look, Big Daddy, it's regular daddy.
Big Daddy: The Chief!  Ooh, I suppose I'd best to run.  [fans himself

% steps onto his airboat [basically, a flat-bottom boat powered by a

Wiggum:    Is that so, Big Daddy?  Well expect this:  [draws gun] The

Big Daddy: New Orleans is my town.  Nobody going to mess with me.  I

Betty:    What?
Moe:      "Go near Moe."  I'd say that's a pretty strong endorsement.

Grampa:   [flashing the international sign for "no" on his display

Moe:      You did it, Grampa!  You really are a love expert.
Grampa:   Dang right.  Fact is, I invented kissing.  It was during

Betty:    So Moe, tell me a little about yourself.

Bart:         [interrupting]  Hitchhike -- it's faster.
All but Bart: Ba-a-r-rt!
Bart:         [laughs]
Marge:        We're like this all the time!
All:          Goodnight, everybody!
-- Don't let the bedbugs bite, "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase"

% A big pillow fight breaks out, with everyone joining in, except Tim
% Conway (who is apparently a conscientious objector).
%
% Troy McClure shuts off the television.

McClure:   That's it for our spinoff showcase.  But what about the
           show that started it all?  How do you keep "The Simpsons"
           fresh and funny after eight long years?  Well, here's
           what's on tap for season nine.
           [McClure pushes a button on the remote, and we see a still
           shot of Homer turning Lisa into a frog]
           [mock-spooky]  Magic powers!
           [McClure cycles through three pictures of Selma marrying
           Apu, the Bee Guy, and Itchy]
           Wedding after wedding after wedding.
           [McClure pushes the button again, and we see Bart
           confronting two thinly disguised variations of himself]
           And did someone say, "long-lost triplets?"
           [cut to a shot of the Simpsons] So join America's favorite
           TV family, [an alien appears, floating above the family]
           and a tiny green space alien named Ozmodiar that only Homer
           can see, on Fox this fall.  It'll be out of this world!
           Right, Ozmodiar?
Ozmodiar:  Damn straight, Troy my man!
Troy + Oz: Goodnight, America!
