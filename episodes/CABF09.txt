   [If you use these summaries to determine if you found the right capsule,
   here's a TV Guide-like synopsis:  After Homer helps Lisa with a defective
   amusement park souvenir, Homer decides to become a champion of the
   downtrodden.  His dedication is tested when he calls a hunger strike to
   keep the local baseball team from moving to Albuquerque, NM -- Ed.]

Blackboard:     "TEMPTATION ISLAND" WAS NOT / A SLEAZY PIECE OF CRAP

                "TEMPTATION ISLAND"  at cutoff

Couch:          The Simpsons, wearing karate robes, run in and karate-chop the
                couch into a pile of couch molecules.  Sensei Homer then whips
                out the remote control, strikes a dramatic karate pose, and
                turns on the TV.  [Recycled from BABF09]

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... Sherri and Terri aren't sitting by one another, as they usually do?
   ... the Albuquerque Isotopes' logo is a coyote wearing a baseball cap and
       T-shirt?

Don Del Grande:
   ... the Blocko-Land tram had square wheels, but the Blocko stroller had
       round ones?
   ... the salon manager sounded like Apu trying to do a French impression?
   ... Henry K. Duff's hair was gray, but his toupee was black?
   ... the glove shrub in front of the stadium had three fingers and a thumb?
   ... one wall in Homer's bathroom has flower wallpaper, but the wall next to
       it does not?

Joe Green:
   ... Homer gets away with trespassing on four separate occasions?
       (Specifically, by sitting in Bart's class, opening the Duff executive's
       private closet, returning to the office with the reporters in tow, and
       camping out in front of Duff Stadium.)

Joe Klemm:
   ... the Isotopes have had at least three owners in the current series run?
   ... Homer and Marge obviously forgot to take the car keys out of the
       ignition?
   ... Duff Man's first name is Sid?

Alie Molino:
   ... Homer attempts to save Snake, a criminal who's attacked him and his
       family before?
   ... Lisa resorts to a typical Bart/Homer [type of] joke ("Bart's got a
       girlfriend!"; "Bart's got a problem!")
   ... Homer says "I'll go to bat for you" and eventually ends up fighting a
       baseball franchise?
   ... the Duff family has been around for at least eight generations, and at
       least one man in each generation has been named Howard?
   ... Act II seems much shorter than usual?  [It was about five minutes,
       about two less than average -- Ed.]
   ... there is a topiary in front of the stadium shaped like a baseball mitt?
   ... behind the scoreboard, there is a Duff fountain sending two sprays into
       the air?
   ... the men in the announcer's booth amuse themselves by throwing pencils
       into the ceiling (we don't see them throwing the pencils, but there are
       pencils in the ceiling)?
   ... there are two references to Jesus in this episode (Homer's delirious
       hunger song: "I'm like Jesus, but not in a sacrilegious way"; "Sid"
       Duff Man: "What would Jesus do?")

Mike Reed:
   ... unlike I&S Land, Homer is excited about going, while Bart and Lisa
       aren't?
   ... Homer was able to keep the sno-globe in his back pocket and not smash
       it when sitting down?  [Steve Alpert replies, "I've tried to smash
       those things, it's tough."]
   ... the souvenir stand guy did not have the typical "sarcastic guy" voice?
   ... we still don't know whether Bart likes Sherri or Terri?
   ... that's one freakin' big cracker Bart's eating!
   ... the first act ended and a second act began on the same scene?
   ... no one bothered to remove the protester's dead body?
   ... no one thinks anything of Homer's "Hungry for the truth" sign?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... the souvenir man's cigar had a "Blockoland" label?
   ... Marge isn't any fatter when she force-feeds the kids dinner?
   ... Homer eats the hot dog (and the other treats thrown at him) in one
       bite?

Preston X:
   ... Blockoland has block-shaped trees?
   ... Homer does a great job building his ham apple?
   ... Homer misses work *again*?
   ... Homer says, "I'll be right back," before going to tell the press about
       the Isotopes?  (How long did he think he'd be gone?)
   ... H.K. Duff VIII's first name is Howard, not Henry as we might expect?

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Steve Alpert:  Finally, a coherent plot that began right away!  Homer as
   people's advocate is a role he's taken on before (the pothole episode), and
   not only are there several funny scenes built around this role, but he
   takes on the hunger strike for about 11 days.  Yeah, we all know no one can
   survive that long, let alone proclaim that a team's moving to Albuquerque,
   but I think that's understood.  I was on a keen lookout to see how much
   exposition there was, and thankfully there was little. Yeah, I'd rather
   have none, but I'll take what I can get. Laugh out loud quite often, low
   chuckles other times.  Also, the ending was reasonable.  If not the best
   episode of the season, tied for it.  (A)

Don Del Grande:  At least it's different from the old "switch straight from
   the subplot to the main plot" in that there was a third plot (Blocko Land
   -- Homer stands up for the little guy -- Homer goes on a hunger strike),
   but it wasn't anything I haven't seen at least one too many times before.
   (B+)

Joe Green:  This show got off to a weak start by rehashing jokes from earlier
   episodes, but eventually picked up steam (Duffman saying "What would Jesus
   do?" was one of my favorites moments).  However, the end result was yet
   another typical "not great, but not horrible either" episode.  (C+)

Carl Johnson:  This is the best episode since "Lost Our Lisa".  Great jokes, a
   good story, and they even mentioned Albuquerque!  Hm, these reviews are
   kinda boring when I can't think of anything bad to say.  (A)

Darrel C. Jones:  Homer going without food was every bit as funny as I thought
   it would be. Also many wonderfully weird jokes (Maggie wanting to go to
   Blockoland, the secret room in the Isotopes owner's office, Homer's
   "vision" the mayor of Albuquerque).  Duffman shone, too.  Absolutely a
   classic.  10/10  (A+)

Jamie Liddel:  Just where the hell did this come from?  It had no
   out-of-the-blue story of lunacy, no cop-out ending, no cheap sight gags, no
   forced flavor-of-the-week pop cultural satire, no Jerkass Homer, no Homer
   being hit by stuff, no insanity, no unfocused wandering plot ; it had none
   of the hallmarks of season 11 or 12 fare.  This was a truly charming and
   very funny episode. Homer's undertaking of a hunger strike to save the team
   would have seemed "wacky" and ridiculous if we had been thrown into it
   head-first through a quick consequential plot turn, as we are thrown into
   so many of OFF's wacky adventures these days.  But, after a quick excursion
   to Blockoland, we are shown a sequence of scenes that show the development
   of "the new Homer", so when the hunger strike is decided upon it makes
   perfect sense when coupled with Homer's traditional naivete and
   impulsiveness.  Perhaps the best thing about this episode is that is
   incredibly tight and flows very smoothly (and is constantly engaging as a
   result), traits which haven't been seen in Simpsons episodes for quite a
   while.  The actual hunger strike scenes are well done, the satire on the
   corporate sports market is effective yet neatly subtle, and the triumphant
   ending is the icing on the cake (or the Southwestern spices on the hot
   dog).  And like all good episodes it's hilarious from start to finish, in
   particular the Peanuts reference and virtually every scene with Duffman in
   it.  A warm, feel-good story with loads of good gags and a smooth, cohesive
   plot -- and I reckon the first Simpsons episode to deserve an grade in the
   A category since Lisa Gets An A back in season 10.  (A-)

Troy J. Matthews:  What a major improvement from last weeks' horrific episode.
   This episode made me forget about last week, and I hope other episode
   following this one will follow suit.  (A-)

Alie Molino:  I didn't like this episode as much as last week's.  I'm not sure
   how promising the actual premise was, but it kind of meandered here and
   there and then rolled to a halt 22 minutes later. Was the story easy to
   follow?  Sure.  Did it go cleanly from one end to the other?  Pretty much.
   Did I enjoy it?  Not as much as I would have liked to.  Not enough laughs,
   not enough action, but perhaps we should have expected that, as Homer
   spends half the episode chained to a lawn chair ... Grade:  (C-)

Michael Nusair:  This wasn't a bad episode.  But it wasn't really good,
   either.  But, if I had to go with one of the two, I'd lean more towards
   "good."  It had a few laughs, especially in the first act.  But there were
   also very loooong periods where the show really lagged.  The plot was
   pretty good, though, and so was the characterization.  However, overall,
   this was a very forgettable episode.  In fact, I think I'm already starting
   to forget it.  (B-)

Mike Reed:  A pleasant surprise from a writer who I thought was washed up.
   After many lackluster episodes from him, John Swartzwelder finally turns it
   around in what may be his most solid episode since [5F21.]  I liked Homer's
   characterization here, and most of the jokes worked.  I also liked the
   ending, and the fact that Homer actually won this time.  I'm am very
   pleasantly surprised.  (A-)

Fox Wolf:  I know everyone here is gonna hate this one, so I'd better get this
   out quickly before someone points out all the bad minutiae and knock my
   review down ... I liked it.  I didn't like it any more than usual, though.
   As usual, the family starts out going somewhere cool and fun, this time,
   it's "Blocko Land".  One word of advice to the writers: Stop doing that!
   After the first act in Tennis the Menace, I thought you'd stop.  That will
   make the grade suffer a bit. Anyway, the plot went as slow as a snail, but
   it was good nonetheless.  So blah blah blah and a review later, I give it a
   (B)

Preston X:  This was an enjoyable episode.  It was nice to see a plot that
   actually made sense.  The story moved along at a fast enough pace to keep
   us interested, and didn't seem rushed.  There wasn't a whole lot of
   hilarious moments but there were a few; my biggest laugh came from Lenny:
   "They said *they* wanted it!"  I did think there was too much crude/shock
   humor in the third act.  Paint Drinking Pete?  What the hell was that?
   Still, this one managed to get rid of the unpleasant aftertaste of CABF12.
   (B-)

Yours Truly:  "Hungry Hungry Homer" does is like watching an older episode,
   and I mean that in a good way.  The pacing is excellent, with an opening
   that serves as a good catalyst to the rest of the story, and the writers
   left plenty of time for cat-and-mouse games between Homer and Mr. Duff.
   The former strikes the right balance of buffoonery and good intentions, and
   the latter shows an interesting perspective on corporate callousness, being
   not so much evil as self-absorbed.  Homer's various crusades are also
   consistently good for a laugh.  They have retro everything else, so why not
   retro "Simpsons" episodes?  "Hungry Hungry Homer" left me hungry for more
   of the same.  (A-)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B+ (3.32)   Std Dev.: 0.6901   (15 reviews computed)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> "Temptation Island" -- it's not a sleazy piece of crap!

Joe Klemm explains:  Just when we thought that Fox has learned their lesson in
   sleaze after the Multi-Millionaire Wedding Fiasco, they reach a new low
   with Temptation Island.  [Fox has kept reaching since this was written --
   Ed.] A weekly series that aired the last few weeks, the show features four
   couples [unmarried, but committed] being split up by gender and sent on
   different parts of the island.  On each part of the island, the couples are
   tempted by hot bachelors that attempt to sway them from their current
   girlfriend/boyfriend, with some wild results.  The biggest level of sleaze
   on the show was achieved when, in a fashion similar to the Multi-
   Millionaire fiasco, Fox didn't check their information too well, as one of
   the couples actually had a child.  As a result, the couple left the show
   early and received counseling.


Benjamin Robinson:  Practically every critic slammed the show, and social
   pundits decried the way it made light of committed relationships.
   (Meanwhile, I'm wondering why any rational couple would volunteer for this
   show.)  Naturally, it was a big ratings hit.


Stephen Houchen remarks:  Why do the opening chalkboard sentences always have
   to be joke-of-the-month.  This is a great way for The Simpsons to become
   dated.  In 10 years when people are watching re-runs, who's gonna remember
   TI??


>> Child's Play

Benjamin Robinson writes:  Three toys get spoofed in this episode.  Lego is
   the most obvious target.  The interlocking plastic blocks have been a
   favorite of children for decades.  Their popularity has even spawned real-
   life parks similar to Blockoland, where detailed tableaus of famous
   buildings, people, and landscapes have been patiently assembled.

   Hungry Hungry Hippos is a children's game here in the States; I don't know
   if it has the worldwide popularity Blocko, er, Lego has.  The game is
   designed for four players.  Each player mans a plastic hippo attached to
   one side of a square board.  The hippo's "tail" is a lever which, when
   pressed, briefly thrusts the hippo's head forward. Plastic balls are
   released on the board, and the players try to scoop up the balls with the
   hippos' heads.  When the head snags the ball, it retracts and the ball
   drops down a hole to a collection area.  The player with the biggest
   collection wins.


Alie Molino adds:  [Trapping the balls] really just involves hitting the
   levers in the backs of the hippos as quickly as possible.  This makes it
   the noisiest board game I ever played as a child.  There's also a travel
   version.


Benjamin Robinson:  Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots is a robot boxing game that
   looks almost identical to the parody version Bart and Nelson played.  Two
   robots stand in a boxing ring.  They are connected to levers the players
   use to move the robots around the ring, and throw punches at the opposing
   robot.  The object is to land a punch on the chin of your opponent's robot,
   which will cause its spring-loaded head to pop up.  In Blockoland this was
   a bad thing, but in real life this means that you won.  It's become one of
   the great kitschy toys.


Dirk adds:  The long-running 1960s-era commercials for this toy featured just
   such a confrontation between two boys as seen with Bart and Nelson.  In the
   old TV commercial, one boy triumphs, and you hear a classic, memorable
   exclamation: "You knocked his BLOCK off!"

   In this episode, Bart exclaims the very same line--which alerts Blocko-Land
   security, who haul Nelson away for his infraction.

   I thought the brief scene astutely summed up the evolution of parental
   attitudes toward children's supervision over the past 35 years.


>> American Slang

Benjamin Robinson explains:  Saying "He's a little light in the loafers" is a
   way of implying that someone is gay.  (Note also that there is a stereotype
   holding that all male hairdressers are gay.)

   Wondering about the footage of Homer with his pants aflame? Schoolchildren
   accuse one another of being untruthful by yelling, "Liar, liar, pants on
   fire!"  Your guess about the origin of this phrase is as good as mine.


>> Hungering for change

In his review, Steve Alpert claimed that neither Homer, nor anyone else, could
   sustain a hunger strike for 11 days.  A few people quickly dissented.


Michael Black led with:  People have done hunger strikes for longer than 11
   days.

   Cesar Chavez's ghost wasn't in there just for fun, though Homer's
   visualizing him as Cesar Romeo (the Joker in the Batman TV series) was
   funny.  Cesar Chavez did quite a few hunger strikes, though I can't at the
   moment find details.

   The suffragettes held hunger strikes, though they were often/always force
   fed.  Gandhi himself led a hunger strike or two, and I'm sure they were
   longer than 11 days.  Mitch Snyder did some long hunger strikes for the
   homeless.  In World War II, a conscientious objector named Corbett Bishop
   did 426 days without food or water, and most of that time he refused to do
   anything at all.  I'm not sure if he was force-fed.  I've known people who
   have done hunger strikes, and they lasted longer than 11 days.

   Eleven days is a very short time.  Admittedly, for something trivial like a
   baseball team moving, it might be difficult to stick with it for more than
   a few days, but for the important things, the cause provides it's own
   power.  People don't go on hunger strikes, or go to jail for a cause, or
   break segregation rules, or walk to New York City like I once did, because
   it's easy;  they do it because the power derives from what they believe in
   and their willingness to make the sacrifice.


Shi No Bai adds:  In the various survival training I've participated in, the
   general rule of thumb is "3 days without water, 3 weeks without food"
   before you die.  The above reference [to Corbett Bishop's strike] must
   relate to a force feeding/intravenous situation.  Also, keep in mind that
   there are loopholes in these types of symbolic starvations.  For instance,
   during the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast for an entire lunar month.  This
   may seem like a long time to go without food, but they actually eat between
   sundown and sunrise.  So you'll have a big, greasy, protein-rich meal at
   4:00 a.m. and then starve all day long before enjoying another greasy,
   protein-rich meal at 9:00 p.m. or so.  (Several of my Muslim friends in
   high school hated Ramadan, as they had decided to become vegetarians and
   hated eating a lot of oily meat dishes in the middle of the night.)

   Homer would have died without water after a couple of days, as would any
   human (if you don't believe me, just try it!), but considering his size, he
   might have been able to last a month or so on stored fat.  :)


>> "I'll party hard, or my name isn't Duffman"

A number of people had creative explanation for Duffman's apparent name change
   (from "Larry" to "Sid").


"Big Hungry Joe":  He changed it because of a paternity suit gone awry.


"inertia7":  Did somebody say long lost *twins*?


Stephen Houchen:  Maybe his name is Larry "Duffman" Sidney.


"mayx":  No, his name is Sid Larry.


Jeremy Bleichman:  Duffman uses a lot of names!  Ohhhhhhhh, yeah!


Matthew Carney offers a plausible theory:  Maybe they're 2 different people
   playing 1 character.  I'm sure Mickey Mouse isn't played by one person 24-7
   at Disney World.  Please ignore that they look a bit similar, that's your
   imagination.


Stephen Houchen counters:  Nobody "plays" Krusty.  He stays in his clown get-
   up all the time.  Same thing with Duffman.  We've even seen him out washing
   his car with his "costume" on.


"Supergooberboob":  Would the analogy of Ronald McDonald be a little more
   clear?  Not the same person is always behind the makeup, on TV, or in local
   appearances.  But it is still "Ronald McDonald".


Jared Rasmussen provides this update:  This alleged goof is seen as void when
   in "Jaws Wired Shut (DABF05)," Duffman said, "Duffman can never die, only
   the actors who play him! Oh yeah!"


Eric Valderrama:  Think that pretty much answers the question. Seeing how
   [this show is from] the next season I am guessing the writers were told
   numerous times about the name change.  So they came up with that.  Or it
   could have just been another joke.

   ["Jaws Wired Shut" aired about ten months after this episode.  We're going
   to list is as a goof since no one in the viewing audience at the time
   "Hungry Hungry Homer" aired could have known the problem would be fixed in
   the future -- Ed.]


>> Albuquerque

Dan Hinojosa:  Great research.  I am from Albuquerque, and our team the Dukes
   moved out last summer.  We have been looking for a team since then.  [And
   now they have one.  What's more, it's called the Isotopes! -- Ed.]  We are
   going to steal Calgary's team is what the rumor is.  The mayor looks like
   our mayor too.  Wow!


Update from Ryan W. Mead:  [Albuquerque did steal the team.]  The Calgary
   Cannons are now the Albuquerque Isotopes (a name inspired by this episode).


Kika Chuck confirms:  Yeah, that's true. Here in New Mexico that was big news.
   Unfortunately, our beloved Isotopes suck; they are 24-30.


Brian Gonzales:  Did you notice the image of Cesar Chavez?  Is it a
   coincidence Albuquerque Sports Stadium is located on Avenida Cesar Chavez?


>> Celebrity Corner

Benjamin Robinson:  Bob Dylan is the phenomenally successful folk singer.  He
   had a penchant for singing about social issues and causes as a way of
   attracting public attention.

   Cesar Chavez fought to protect the rights of migrant farm workers.  He
   organized a union that would eventually become the United Farm Workers of
   America.  He organized boycotts against grape and lettuce growers, but I'm
   not aware of any hunger strikes for which he is responsible.  [But see
   Michael Black's comment, above -- Ed.]

   Mike Farrell is the actor who played B. J. "Beej" Hunnicutt on the TV
   series "M*A*S*H."  In his post-"M*A*S*H" days, he has embraced a variety of
   causes, and a "My Core Beliefs" book wouldn't be too far out of the realm
   of possibility.  Incidentally, Wayne Rogers (the guy Farrell supposedly
   railed against in the book) played Trapper John, Hunnicutt's predecessor on
   "M*A*S*H."


Haynes Lee writes:  Mike Farrell didn't rail against Wayne Rogers but he was
   very embittered about being typecast by M*A*S*H. One of his more loopy
   post-MASH television appearances was hosting a show about UFOs where it's
   revealed that aliens love strawberry ice cream (I am not making this up!).


>> Take me out to the Car Watch

Benjamin Robinson:  As Homer settles in to start his hunger strike, an orange
   VW Old Beetle convertible can be seen in the parking lot behind him.
   Later, a pair of hardtops, one brown and one red, is visible.  Perhaps
   they're breeding back there?

   The dark green sedan behind Homer resembles a Dodge Dart (or maybe a
   Plymouth Valiant) from the early 70s.


>> Coming Attractions

Mike Reed transcribes:  (clips of "The Land of Chocolate" and Homer drooling
   from [2F06] are shown)

   Voice-Over: Homer's appetite is legendary ... so what would make him go on
   a hunger strike?
   Homer: So hungry ... (his stomach growls and the chains rattle) I'm wasting
   away ... I'm down to a B-cup! (Homer tries to eat his hand.)


>> Syndication finally works!

Paul Melnyk rejoices:  Well, I was watching the syndicate of "Hungry, Hungry,
   Homer".  I loved the episode, so perfect, and such an anti-thesis to what
   everyone hates about Scully's reign.  Homer actually becomes kinder, and
   when the problem of a baseball team moving became apparent, he would work
   for it to stop it.  The end scene in the stadium was icing on the cake.
   However, I thought it was killed by the mayor of Albuquerque scene.  Yet by
   god, in syndication, it's cut out, making the episode perfect, one again.

% The show opens with a commercial for Blockoland, the park where
% everything is made of Blocko Brand(tm) Assembly Fun Blocks.  Homer is
% hooked, despite the fact that even the park-goers in the commercial
% seem un-enthused.

Homer:	Kids, how would you like to go to ... Blockoland!
Bart +
  Lisa:	Meh.
Homer:	But the TV gave me the impression that --
Bart:	We said, "Meh!"
Lisa:	M-e-h, meh.
-- Intense indifference, "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% Marge is more willing to go.  So is Maggie, who is so enthusiastic
% that she straps herself into her car seat and "hops" it out the
% front door.  The family thinks this is cute -- until they hear the
% car's motor start.
%
% The tram at Blockoland bumpily rolls along on its square wheels.  It
% drops off the Simpsons and some other people at the park entrance,
% and then continues on its way.  At the front gate, a man dressed as
% a block with a cowboy hat greets guests with a friendly, "Howdy,
% partner!"  Another block, dressed as Lincoln gets too close and
% bumps into the cowboy.  The two stick together and need to be pried
% apart by park attendants.  Elsewhere, a little girl bounces down a
% blocky slide.
%
% The family stops at a map showing the lay of the land.

Lisa:	Okay, we have our choice of Rectangle Land, Cube Country, 
	or Squaresville.
Marge:	Squaresville sounds pretty cool.
-- Only to you, Marge, "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% Homer amuses himself with funhouse mirrors.  The first one makes him
% look as if he's constructed of Fun Assembly Blocks.

Homer:	[robotically] I am a robot.  Do what I say.  [laughs]
	[moves to the next mirror, which is similar to the first 
	but with the extra effect of making Homer look shorter]
	[robotically] I am a washing machine.  Do what I say.  
	[laughs]

% In the arcade, Bart and Nelson play with Rock-Em Sock-Em Robots. 
% Nelson bops Bart's robot in such a way that the robot's head pops up
% on a spring.  A horrified attendant says, "You knocked his block
% off!" and Nelson is dragged away to parts unknown.
%
% The family eats at the "Build Your Own Meal" restaurant.

Homer:	[holds up a blocky-looking apple] Check it out -- I built 
	myself a healthy apple.
Lisa:	But you made it out of ham cubes.
Home:	Yup, a shiny new apple.  [shines the "apple" on his shirt, 
	where it leaves a grease stain, and takes a bite]
-- Keeps the doctor away, "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% Homer has an epiphany while riding in a Blocko-boat with Lisa.  "I
% get it," he says, "Everything's made of blocks!"  Even the "water"
% surrounding the boat is just loose blue Assembly Fun Blocks.  He
% playfully splashes a few in Lisa's face, and a safety attendant
% reprimands him.  When Homer defies his order, the attendant gets
% down from his chair, and walks across the "water" towards Homer's
% boat.  Homer leaps overboard, and immediately sinks.  After some
% flailing around he manages to climb back into the boat.  Lifting his
% shirt, he discovers that the Blocko water has Blocko leeches, and
% hurriedly plucks them off his chest.
%
% Aside from that incident, it was a pretty fun day for the Simpson
% family.  They drive home from the park with their souvenirs.  Bart
% is having second thoughts about his uncomfortable shirt made of
% Assembly Fun Blocks.

Bart:	Ow!  Why did I get this Lego(tm) shirt?
Marge:	Don't you mean Blocko shirt?
Bart:	Right, right.  *Blocko* shirt.
Marge:	Lisa, how's your Eiffel Tower kit?
Lisa:	It's okay, but it's missing a piece.  [points to missing 
	block at the tower leg]
Homer:	Welcome to real life, Lisa.  You can't fight City Hall, 
	a.k.a. Blockoland, so don't even try?
Marge:	What kind of thing is that to tell your children.
Homer:	It's what I always tell them.  I told them that twice 
	yesterday, and then again as they were going to sleep.
Marge:	I'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
Homer:	You're right, honey.  Hear that, kids?  [with gusto] The 
	Simpsons are going to Blockoland!
All:	Yay!  [well, all except Maggie]
-- "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% Homer U-turns the car, surprising the other drivers on the highway. 
% The family arrives as workers disassemble Blockoland for overnight
% storage.  Fortunately, the souvenir man is still at his stand.

Homer:		You sold my little girl a shoddy Eiffel Tower.
Salesman:	Hey, tough luck, pal.  You can't fight the souvenir 
		industry, we're too powerful.
-- "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% Homer agrees, and walks off.  When he sees how disappointed Lisa is,
% he works up the courage for a second try.  He vows to give the man
% "a little souvenir of my own," which turns out to be a snow globe
% with a little bust of Homer inside.  The souvenir guy is so touched,
% he digs around in a box of missing Eiffel Tower pieces and hands the
% tower leg to Lisa.

Lisa:	Thank you, Dad.
Homer:	Hey, any friend of Marge is a friend of mine.

% On the way home, Homer pledges to stand up for the little guy more
% often.  He quickly gets the opportunity to make good on his pledge. 
% Just up ahead on the road, three policemen beat Snake savagely with
% their nightsticks.  Homer guns his car toward them, scaring the
% policemen away.

Homer:	Those bullies are gone now.
Snake:	You idiot!  They were beating out my shirt fire.  [his T-
	shirt bursts into flame]
Homer:	My heart was in the right place, jerk!  [gets in the car 
	and peels out, spraying Snake with gravel]
-- "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% Homer continues standing up for the little guy.

Homer:	I'm going to spend the whole day helping schmoes with 
	their problems.  Got a problem, Bart?
Bart:	A girl at school won't go to the dance with me.
Lisa:	[taunting] Bart's got a girlfriend.
Bart:	No, I don't that's the problem.
Lisa:	[giggles] Bart's got a problem.
Homer:	Don't worry, son.  I'll handle this.
-- "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% Homer infiltrates Bart's classroom and sits next to Sherri.

Homer:	Come on, why won't you go out with Bart?
Sherri:	He's a smelly, ugly dork.
Homer:	Please, "ugly" is such a smelly word.  Who would you 
	rather go out with?
Sherri:	Tommy.  [indicates a handsome boy bathed in an angelic 
	glow]
Homer:	Well, duh!  He's breathtaking.  But Bart has inner beauty, 
	like you'd find in a rodent.  [cut to Bart, gnawing rat-
	like on a cracker, then back to Homer]  And face it, 
	you're no prize, either.  You wear braces, you dress like 
	a kid, and you're not getting any younger.
Edna:	He's right.  Grab something, and don't let go.

% The beauty parlor doesn't honor Marge's coupon for two free hair
% streaks, so Homer goes to bat for her.

Hairdresser:	Yes, may I help you?
Homer:		Nice place you got here.  Oh, look, a hairnet.  It 
		would be a shame if it was hurled to the ground.  
		[Homer tries to throw it hard to the floor, but it 
		just gently floats down] Oh, how clumsy of me.  
		[unscrews a jar lid, and drops it on the counter] 
		Oops.
Hairdresser:	Why are you doing these things?
Homer:		Either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more 
		lids will be unscrewed.
Hairdresser:	I cannot streak that much hair.  Think of the costs 
		-- I'd be ruined.
Homer:		Oh, really?
		[cut to the back room.  Homer has his reading 
		glasses and an eyeshade on, and sits at a table with 
		an adding machine.  He and the hairdresser go over 
		the store's financial books]
		Boy, you weren't kidding.  Your profit margins are 
		razor-thin.
Hairdresser: 	You see?  This is what I'm --
Homer:		Wait a minute.  Four hundred a month for loafer 
		lightener?
Hairdresser:	But we must have it -- it is the lifeblood of the

Homer:		What a crazy room.  There's no Albuquerque Isotopes.  
		It's the Springfield [realizes] Oh.
Duff:		No, no.  There's no "oh."
Homer:		You're moving the team to Albuquerque, aren't you?
Duff:		No, no, we would never abandon our loyal Springfield 
		fans.  By the way, all this barging into rooms 
		marked "Private" must have made you thirsty.  Would 
		you like a beer?
Homer:		Well, okay, but you can't silence Homer Simpson.  
		I'm a friend of the downtrodden.  And I'm not going

% Still, there's one more publicity favor that Homer can do for the
% Isotopes.  Duff and his executives bring him to a microphone set up
% on the field.

Duff:	Well, Homer, your hunger strike lasted twelve amazing 
	days.
Homer:	Oh, me so hung-y.
Duff:	Of course you are, Hungry Hungry Homer.  So why not break 
	your fast with our new Isotope Dog Supreme.
	[Duffman presents a hot dog loaded with toppings]
Homer:	[sniffing] Oh, oh, so hard to resist.  Mesquite-grilled 
	onions, jalapeo relish ... wait a minute, those are 
	Southwestern ingredients.  [the crowd gasps] Mango-lime 
	salsa?  That's the kind of bold flavor they enjoy in ... 
	Albuquerque!  [the crowd gasps again]
Lenny:	[in the stands] He's right!
Moe:	Yeah, and the wrapper says, "Albuquerque Isotopes."
Mel:	Homer was right!  They're planning to move the team!
-- Vindicated at last, "Hungry Hungry Homer"

% The crowd looks angry, and shouts at Duff.  Homer quickly has them
% chanting, "Tell the truth!"  Duff orders Duffman to get Homer out of
% sight.  Homer asks him not to, but instead to "stand up for the
% little guy."  Duffman is torn between these two alternatives.  He
% asks himself what Jesus would do.  In an interesting theological
% conclusion, Duffman picks up his boss, twirls him around, and hurls
% him into the stands.
%
% Homer takes a victory lap around the field.  Chanting, "Eat!  Eat! 
% Eat!" the crowd tosses hot dogs, pretzels, and ice cream cones at
% Homer, who snarfs them down right out of mid-air.  The Simpsons, who
% are in the stadium that night, are proud of him.  The fireworks go
% off.  The little guy has won.
%
% Meanwhile, someone in Albuquerque is watching this scene unfold on
% television.

Mayor:	Dang!  That town's got too much spirit.  [turns off the 
	TV] Looks like we'll have to steal some other baseball 
	team.  See what Dallas wants for the Cowboys.
Aide:	Uh, that's a football team, sir.
Mayor:	They'll play what I tell 'em to play.  [walks to a window]
	[menacingly] For I am the Mayor of Albuquerque.
-- The new evil empire, "Hungry Hungry Homer"
