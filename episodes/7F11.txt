===============================================================================
>> Shaft

My movie guide says that there were three ``Shaft'' movies

  Shaft (1971) - A black private eye finds himself at odds with
                 a powerful racketeer.
  Shaft's Big Score (1972) - Shaft avenges the death of a friend
                 and comes up against the numbers racket.
  Shaft in Africa (1973) - Shaft is kidnapped by an Ethiopian emir who
                 wants him to track down a gang of slavers.

All three starred Richard Roundtree as the title character, and
the first one received an Academy Award nomination for musical score
and won an Academy Award for its title song.  (Must've been a slow year.)

The guide also says that it spawned off a television series
and stimulated even more violent imitators.

Jym Dyer {jd}: "Shaft" was a blaxploitation movie like "Superfly."  It was an
action-packed thang starring an ultra-hip black hero with an Afro.

Al Wesolowsky {abw}:  They were based on novels by Ernest Tidyman, who wrote
several Shaft yarns.  All are set in NYC, where Shaft is a private
detective.   Tidyman was sort of a less-skilled version of Chester Himes.

>>> The words

jthomas@ducvax.auburn.edu:

These lyrics are a transcription from the theme played during the opening
credits of the movie ``Shaft''.  Issac Hayes wrote and performed the
soundtrack.  Check out your local video store and sing along.  Parentheses
indicate background singers.

    Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine with all the chicks?
        (SHAFT!)
    Damn right!
    Who is the man who would risk his neck for his brother man?
        (SHAFT!)
    Can you dig it?
    Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about?
        (SHAFT!)
    Right on.
    They say this cat is a bad mother...
        (SHUT YOUR MOUTH!)
    I'm talking about Shaft.
        (Then we can dig it.)
    He's a complicated man but no one understands him but his woman.
        (John Shaft!)

They don't write 'em like this anymore.

>> Homer's videotape for Maggie

Mike Killianey {mk}:  If you look in the upper-left hand corner of the
screen, you'll notice a red dot flashing on and off beneath `REC'.  I'm not
sure if there's any standard, but on my family's camcorder, this is a
warning to the user that the camera is paused, and nothing is being
recorded.  So maybe Homer didn't get ANY of this on tape after all!

>> The (formal) dinner scene

agi@caen.engin.umich.edu (Andrew Isztwan):

Yes, you saw Bart's hair parted down the middle.  It even looked a bit wavy.

connolly@wam.umd.edu (John. P. Connolly):

I think Bart looked very slick in the supper scene, in his spiffy suit.
But, he was still wearing his shorts.  Has anyone seen a scene where
Bart wasn't wearing shorts (except when he is in his pajamas)?

>> The final scene

Freeze-frame addicts note that the bag says `Pork Rinos Light', though
the significance of this is unclear.  And Jym Dyer points out that the
shopping list in <Simpsons Illustrated> spells it `Pork Rinds Lite'.

Anneliese Lilje suggests that perhaps the message is that living life to its
fullest for HOMER is sitting in front of the T.V. eating pork rinds...and that
may be sad to us but he looked pretty contented.

Richard Goehring reminds us that it's like the song says:

     A big bag of pork rinds, gonna carry me to my grave...
                                -- Homer singing "Born under a Bad Sign"

>> The deadly blowfish

currmann@pnet51.orb.mn.org (Curtis Hoffmann):

It is fugu, a blow fish, that has the deadly nerve toxin in one of the
internal organs (either the liver of gall bladder, I forget which).  There
are fugu restaurants in Japan, where the thrill of risking death by eating
even a slightly tainted sliver of meat is the whole point of the experience.

You must be a licensed fugu chef to work at such a restaurant, but there
are a number of "black market" fugu stands around, too.

However, fugu usually kills you within 15 minutes, not 24 hours.  It starts
with a tingling in the fingers, and works its way up your arms and legs, until
you are completely paralyzed, and you die when it reaches your heart.

I'd guess that the fugu chef, and the doctor, were having a little fun at
Homer's expense.

Spage Yee {sy}:  This fish is poisonous because its innards contain
tetratodoxin (TTX) which is a neurotoxin, which blocks either the sodium
or potassium (one or the other it's been a while since I studied
neurobiology) channels in your nervous system.

Michael T. Itamura refers the interested reader to the August 1984 issue of
National Geographic.  Stories and photographs of the leopard puffer.
(Even a story about a famed Kabuki actor who ate the liver of the puffer
and paid for it with his life).  Quite interesting.

>> Akira

Mark A. Holtz {mah} notes that Akira is one of the most popular
Anime/Japanese Animation films around.

Lisa:  As usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point
       entirely.
-- Marge suggests the family go to a Japanese restaurant,
   `One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% chefs yell at them in Japanese.  The hostess explains they were merely
% saying Hello.  So Homer yells ``HELLO!'' back at them.

This is our karaoke bar.  Now it is empty, but soon it will be hopping
with drunken Japanese businessmen.
-- Restaurant hostess, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% The family are seated and their waiter Akira takes their order.  Marge
% asks, ``What would you recommend for a family that's not sure they
% should be here?''  He suggests the `very nonthreatening' sushi samurai,
% and Marge and Lisa order it.

Bart:  Akira, my good man, I'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel.
Akira: Very good.
Bart:  Do you have any giant squid?  The kind that drags men to their deaths?
Akira: Not today.
-- At the Japanese restaurant, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% Homer has trouble choosing.  ``All looks so terrible.''  He places his
% order.  The Master Chef demonstrates his technique and scolds his
% apprentice.  ``Hang your head in shame.''  The dishes are brought, and
% Homer loves it.
%
% In the karaoke bar, a gentleman introduces himself.  ``Hi, my name is
% Richie Sakai.  I'm an anaesthesiologist, and I'd like to dedicate this
% next song to my wife, Patti.''  He proceeds to sing.
%
% Homer eagerly places his next order.  Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa sing `Shaft'
% in the karaoke bar.  Homer looks for something he hasn't tried yet and
% orders fugu.  Akira tries to talk Homer out of it, to no avail.

Come on, pal!  Fugu me!
-- Homer snaps at Akira the waiter, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% The kids continue their singing.  The Master Chef hears a car horn.  ``Ah,
% she's here.  Cover for me.''  After the Master Chef leaves, Akira places
% the fugu order, and the apprentice decides that the preparation of fugu
% should be left to the Master, since one wrong slice and the result is
% fatally poisonous.  The apprentice pays a visit to the parking lot.

Apprentice:  But master, we need your skilled hands.
Master chef: My skilled hands are busy!

Fan-fugu-tastic!
-- Homer eats some fugu, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% Akira, the apprentice chef, and the Master Chef frantically yell in
% Japanese to Homer.  (``Beautiful language, isn't it Marge?'')
% The apprentice chef tells Homer he may have been poisoned.

No need to panic.  There is a map to the hospital on the back of the menu.
-- Apprentice chef at the Japanese restaurant,
   ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% At the hospital, Homer sits on an examining table in his underwear,
% and Dr. Hibbert and Marge come in.  Homer takes a look at Marge's
% sad demeanor and concludes, ``Ooh!  It's good news, isn't it!''  But
% it isn't.

Dr. H: You have twenty-four hours to live.
Homer: Twenty-four hours!
Dr. H: Well, twenty-two.  I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.
-- Homer learns he's going to die, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% Homer embraces Marge.

Well, if there's one consolation, it's that you will feel no pain at all
until some time tomorrow evening, when your heart suddenly explodes.
-- Dr. Hibbert explains the consequences of eating tainted fugu,
   ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

Dr. H: Now, a little death anxiety is normal.  You can expect to go through
       five stages.  The first is denial.
Homer: No way!  Because I'm not dying! [hugs Marge]
Dr. H: The second is anger.
Homer: Why you little! [steps towards Dr. H]
Dr. H: After that comes fear.
Homer: What's after fear?  What's after fear? [cringes]
Dr. H: Bargaining.
Homer: Doc, you gotta get me out of this!  I'll make it worth your while!
Dr. H: Finally, acceptance.
Homer: Well, we all gotta go sometime.
Dr. H: Mr. Simpson, your progress astounds me.
-- Homer learns he's going to die, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% [End of Act One.  Time: 7:18]
%
% That evening in bed, Homer decides not to tell the kids and shows Marge
% the list of things he wants to do on his final day.  He asks Marge,
% ``What's that word you use for when you and I, you know...''  Marge asks,
% ``When we're intimate?''  Homer adds ``Be intamit [sic] with Marge'' to
% his list.  Marge suggests they also get up early and watch the sunrise.
% Homer kisses Marge good-night.
%
% At 6:00am, the alarm clock goes off, and Homer shuts it off.
% Homer finally wakes up at 11:30am.  He rushes downstairs.

Homer: Marge!  Why did you let me sleep so late?
Marge: You looked so peaceful lying there.
Homer: There'll be plenty of time for that!
-- Homer oversleeps to begin his final day on this earth,
   ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% He consults his list.  ``Have man-to-man with Bart.''  Homer comes into
% Bart's room.  ``Come here, boy.''  ``Oh, man,'' complains Bart, as he
% drops his pants for a spanking.  But that's not what Homer came in for.
% He tells Bart that (after Homer) he's the man of the house, and Bart
% whines, ``Lisa never lifts a finger, why don't you go yell at her!''
% Homer tells Bart, ``This is <good> stuff!''

I want to share something with you:
The three little sentences that will get you through life.
   Number 1:  [whispers] Cover for me.
   Number 2:  Oh, good idea, Boss!
   Number 3:  It was like that when I got here.
-- Homer tells Bart the secret, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% ``Hey, this <is> good stuff.''  Homer drags Bart into the bathroom
% to teach him to shave.  Bart's face is lathered as he watches Homer
% finish with ``the little spot under your nose.''

Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares,
and stick one there... and there... and any place you're bleeding...
there... and there... Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on
your face.
-- Homer teaches Bart how to shave, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% Next comes the after-shave.  Homer slaps it on and screams in pain.
% ``Ooh, ahh, eeh, yaaargh!  Rrrrrr.  Ooh, yargh!  You son-of-a-ohhh!  Eee!''
% ``And that's how we shave.''  Bart accidentally knocks over the
% after shave.  ``Why you little!''  Bart quickly says, ``It was like
% that when I got here!''  Homer embraces him.  ``Oh, that's my boy!''
%
% Next on the list is listening to Lisa play her sax.  Homer comes into
% Lisa's room, and she offers to stop playing.  Homer asks her to continue.
% Though confused, she does so.  Homer cries at her melancholy music, but
% her tune changes to something more upbeat, and Homer sings and dances.

Oh I want to be in that rumba
When the saints go over there!
-- Homer sings to Lisa's sax playing,
   ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% Next is, ``Make videotape for Maggie.''  Homer pays a visit to Ned Flanders.

Ned:   Simpson, what a pleasant surprise.  We were just pulling taffy.
Homer: Gee, the fun never stops at the Flanders house, does it.
Ned:   Heh heh, no sirree-bob!
-- Homer borrows Ned's camcorder, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% Homer borrows Ned's camcorder, and Ned invites Homer's family over for
% a barbecue tomrrow.  Homer declines, then reconsiders...

Homer: I'll even bring the thickest juciest T-bones you've ever seen.
Ned:   Mm mm.  Sounds terrif!
Homer: Heh, the joke's on him!  I'll be dead by then!
-- Ned invites Homer over for a cookout,
   ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% At home, Homer sets up the camera and begins recording.

Ahem.  This is a videotape for my daughter Maggie.  Hi, Maggie!  I'm
speaking to you from beyond the grave.  Woooooooo!  Hee hee hee, hope
that didn't scare you.  Well, Maggie, you're grown-up now, and unless
you taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man
your father was.  He was a simple man, a kind man, a gentle man who
loved his children and... [phone rings]  D'oh!  [answers] Hello!
Yeah, he's here, who is this? [scratches his butt] ... Bart's friend
Millhouse?  Bart!  Get your butt down here!
-- Homer tries to make a tape for Maggie,
   ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% The next item is ``Make peace with Dad''.  Homer pays a visit to Grampa
% at the Retirement Home.

Homer:  Dad, we've never been too close, have we.
Grampa: Not to my knowledge.
Homer:  Never once went fishing or played catch or even hugged each other.
Grampa: We never danced the hootchie-koo, either.  Whatcher point?
-- Homer reconciles with his father,
   ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% Homer tells Grampa he loves him, and the two embrace.  Homer says he
% has to go, but Grampa insists they've got a lot of catching up to do.
% Grampa prevails on Homer to go fishing; later, they play catch and
% wrestle.  (While doing these things, Homer crosses things off his list
% he no longer has time to do.)  Homer finally pulls himself away as
% Grampa presses his face against the car window.  ``I love you, son!''
% Mumbles Homer, ``Gee, the old guy's a little love-starved.''
% Hoping to make up for lost time, Homer puts the pedal to the metal,
% but gets pulled over.  He tells the two cops to give him a ticket,
% but they don't take kindly to being ordered around and throw him
% into the slammer.

Homer: [spots his harmonica-playing cell-mate]
       That's sort of nice.  What are you in for?
Man:   Atmosphere.
-- Homer lands in jail, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''

% Homer can't bear to use his one phone call to call Marge, so he calls
% Barney.  But he gets an answering machine.  Homer leaves an angry
% message, and we see that Barney is home, clipping his toenails.  Barney
% quickly picks up.

Homer:  [on the phone] You gotta help me, Barney, I'm in jail.
Barney: You are?  Hey, Homer, go to the window.

% Homer tells Barney to bring $50 for bail.  (``Whadja do, kill a judge?'')
% Barney hunts around his room to scrounge up $50.  He also finds a slice
% of pizza.  Meanwhile, at home, Marge stares out the front window.

Bart:  Why are we all dressed up?
Marge: [staring out the window waiting for Homer]
       Because sometimes it's fun to dress up for dinner.
Lisa:  Why are we using the good china?
Marge: Because sometimes it's fun to use the good china.
Bart:  What's with the candles?
Marge: Sometimes it's fun to use candles.
Lisa:  Why are we waiting for Dad?
Marge: Because we love your father and enjoy his company.
Bart:  Why are we <really> waiting for Dad?

% Chief Wiggum counts up the bail money.  (``We don't usually take rusty
% money.'')  Barney drives Homer home and is crushed that Homer isn't
% going to have one last drink with his buddies.  Homer tries to explain
% that there simply wasn't time.  He then spots Burns.

Burns:    [peering through binoculars]

Homer:    Hey Burns!  Eat! my! shorts!
Burns:    Who the Sam Hill was that?
Smithers: Why it's Homer Simpson, sir.  One of the schmos from sector 7-G.
Burns:    Simpson, eh?

       That always will I love you,
       My one, my love, my all.

we'll get some matzo-ball soup.  I love the San Antonio Spurs,
by the way, if you're betting on the NBA this year, I think they'll
win it all.  So I guess there's nothing more to say but... [closing music]
