> "TV Guide" Synopsis  {bg}
==============================================================================
   [TV Guide Close-Up]  In the sharp 11th-season finale, the Simpsons are
   studied in a Behind the Music-style documentary depicting their rise to
   stardom -- and the "private hell" that followed.  VH1's Jim Forbes narrates
   their story, beginning with the evolution of The Simpsons TV show, from
   Homer's original idea called "My Funny Family."  The series took off, but
   the physical comedy took a toll on Homer, bringing an addiction to
   painkillers.  Wild spending, bad investments and tax problems ensued,
   leading to an incident at the Iowa State Fair that split them up, and
   prompted solo projects -- until Willie Nelson stepped in.

   [TV Guide ad] When the Camera Stops ... Who Are the Real Simpsons?
   Tonight, see a side of them you've never seen before!  Bart: Eat My Shorts?
   I'd never say that! Homer: Be quiet!  And take your anti-growth hormones.

Couch:          The family runs to the couch, which has a coin box on the side
                labeled, "MAGIC FINGERS."  Bart drops a coin in the box, and
                it starts vibrating with such vigor that it jiggles right out
                of frame.

==============================================================================

Matthew Anscher:
   ... CBS isn't considered a "major" network?
   ... the clip that HRH Queen Elizabeth was watching was not from an actual
       Simpsons episode?
   ... bubblegum recordings like "Simpsons Christmas Boogie" are considered
       Thrash Metal by the National Association of Radio Arts and Sciences?

       "gimmicky" and "nonsensical"?
   ... Dr. Hibbert apparently attended Baylor University with Willie Nelson?
   ... Woody Allen's skin is a lighter shade of yellow than all the other
       yellow-skinned people in the Awareness Awards audience?
   ... the considerable amount of name-calling in this episode; calling
       Grandpa a "coot," Dr. Hibbert a "meddler," and Gloria Allred "shrill"?

Nathan DeHoff:
   ... this is the first time anyone has referred to Homer strangling Bart as
       child abuse?

       astronaut?

       in quite some time?
   ... at the Iowa state fair, Maggie wears Lisa-style shoes?
   ... at the thanksgiving dinner, Maggie and Grandpa are at the "kid table"?
   ... Homer explains why Lisa (and, presumably, Bart and Maggie) didn't get
       older despite the show lasting longer than one year?
   ... they didn't explain a few things, like how Maggie always falls?

Darrel Jones:
   ... Mr. Burns' lawyer also works for Marge?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the picture of the Last Supper behind Flanders?
   ... the hard time that Homer and Rupert have signing the contract suggests
       that they are left-handed?
   ... the Iron Giant statue behind CBG?  [Eric Sansoni notes that "Iron
       Giant" was directed by "Simpsons" alum Brad Bird -- Ed.]

James Reisdorf:
   ... this is the first time the opening "Simpsons" caption has ran twice in
       the same show (excluding the "Thompsons" intro from "Cape Feare
       (9F22)")?
   ... the little flashing words that show on the BTM "flash screen" are
       different in the 3 times it shows up?

*  Home Improvement, one the shows the family watched before they made their

*  Bart the Daredevil premiered in December, thus it is very doubtful that
   they filmed it in April.

*  The "aborted couch scene" looks like the one first used in 4F03, which
   first appeared in November of 1996, yet the caption said it was first

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Wilson Banswell:  The writers addressed some strange things in this episode.
   Such as why there are so many crappy weird tripped up episodes.  And why
   Homer must be crushed, squished, pounded, and destroyed in every episode.
   You would think this episode would suck because of all the meta refs, but
   to a hard core fan, it was great.  I loved how the writers told us what we
   knew all along, that the guest appearances are crammed down their throats!
   And the ending was great.  My expectations were high, but they were
   exceeded.  One final note, all those metaphors were great!  (A+)

Arup Baral:  A truly excellent episode.  Not only did it leave me ROTFL, its
   self-parody was so thick that it very much defines season 11 or the show
   itself for that matter.  The Acts I and II were the strongest, but the
   whole episode was the most solid in many a season.  The fact that they
   recognize the zany plots of recent seasons (Principal and the Pauper) and
   the use of guest stars to boost ratings.  Without a doubt, the best of the
   season.  If this were my last meal (last episode of the series), I would
   tell the warden to bring on the electric chair!  (A+)

Nate Birch:  Well I didn't think the current batch of writers could do it, but
   they've actually managed to produce a truly classic episode.  The whole
   concept of having a behind the scenes episode of the Simpsons was great,
   but the writers managed to take it and do more with it than I could have
   imagined.  While watching this episode it really felt like I was watching a
   "behind the scenes" show you might see on E! or something, and the episode
   never strayed from that.  Despite the different format the family was all
   nicely in character, and this episode was funny as hell.  It had a great
   mix of both slapstick and more intelligent humor and was filled with tons
   of great META refs and inside jokes for us more informed Simpsons fans.
   Explaining the low quality of recent episodes as being a result of cast
   problems and Homer's painkiller addiction was brilliant.  Hopefully at
   least a few of the season 12 episodes will be this good.  (A+)

Nathan DeHoff:  I'm kind of surprised that it took this long before "The
   Simpsons" did the "What if the characters were portrayed by real actors?"
   thing, which has become sort of a cartoon tradition by this point.
   Overall, they did this quite well, complete with hilariously pathetic
   narration, and lots of amusing gags.  In a way, though, it suffered from
   standard Season 11 narration, in that the writers seemed to want to go in
   every possible direction with the idea.  For instance, I wish they would
   have focused a bit more on "behind-the-scenes" moments for actual episodes,
   which they did quite well for "Bart the Daredevil" and "The Principal and
   the Pauper."  Instead, however, they decided to throw in some moments from
   "episodes" that never really existed.  Sure, they were funny (Richie Rich
   as Bart was great), but I kind of wish they had concentrated their focus a
   little more.  (A-)

Don Del Grande:  one of the best episodes in the series, and I believe it's
   because they weren't stuck with the "usual rules of Springfield" that they
   can bend in Halloween specials as well.  Of course, this could be a real
   sign that they're really starting to run out of ideas ...  (A)

Tony Hill:  What the hell was that?  Why do they expect us to take them
   seriously when they no longer do so themselves?  As a parody of the
   documentaries about old TV which is now the rage, this was passable, but as
   a canonical episode of OFF this was an abomination.  When has it ever been
   suggested that the Simpsons are actors playing themselves on TV?  This
   treatment of the Simpsons cast is not faithful to the dramatic context.  I
   give it an  (F)

Darrel Jones:  Season Eleven, which was a great year, is closing out with a
   bang.  Let's hope they can come up with more wonderful, original concepts
   for Season Twelve.  Several great moments and gags; Taco's tribute to Falco
   will become an all-time classic gag.  9/10  (A)

Adam Long:  Well, I was expecting this one to be the best of the season, and
   it was by a longshot.  This episode far outshone most episodes of the past
   two seasons, with the possible exception of Simpsons Bible Stories.  The
   phony off-screen life of OFF was creatively woven, with laughs coming
   non-stop.  In fact, I'd say this was arguably the funniest episode ever.
   The little "Behind the Music" touches added a lot as well.  And I don't
   think any of us were expecting the location of Springfield to be given
   away, but that didn't upset me, since there are only so many "Where is
   Springfield" gags you can do, and the fact that they've been hiding it for
   11 years, then just come right out and say it gets points for sheer shock
   value.  I was a little worried after last week's episode, but this one got
   me looking forward to Season 12.  (A+)

Paul Melnyk:  As many put it, a bizarre and unique episode.  This being the
   5th clip show, I think it's definitely one of the fresher ones.  One main
   reason this episode was good was because they didn't do the show at all.
   There was some great effects work for the "Behind The Music" parody, and
   the animated clips representing metaphors were very amusing.  I do wish
   they could have done more references on the actual show itself though, but
   none the less, a good finale.  (B)

Michael Nusair:  I don't know what to say about this episode.  I just really
   don't like the idea behind it.  For me, the idea that OFF are actually
   actors portraying themselves on a  fictional show takes away something from
   the rest of the episodes.  I know that  this is an off-continuity episode,
   like "The Simpsons Spin-off showcase," but it still seems wrong to me. As
   it stands, "Behind the Laughter" was essentially just a string of loosely
   connected gags, most of which didn't really work for me.  I did laugh a
   couple of times, but I still think that this wasn't a good idea for an
   episode.  When I watch an episode of the Simpsons, I don't want to think of
   OFF as fictional characters playing fictional characters in a fictional
   show for other fictional characters and real people, and ... Ummm ...  This
   isn't making much sense.  But I think you know what I mean.  Let's just say
   I didn't like it, and leave it at that.  (D+)

Damian Penny:  I thought this episode was the most brilliant half hour of
   television I have ever seen, Simpsons or otherwise.  This show is often at
   its best when it pokes fun at its own popularity, and this one does that
   well -- not to mention jabbing at "biography" shows like "Behind the
   Music".  And there are simply too many big laughs to list here, but ...
   "Momma Mia", "Simpsons Christmas Boogie" playing over the closing credits,
   Richie Rich replacing Bart for 9 episodes, "Krustophenia" ... the only
   downside to this episode is that, when the show eventually airs its final
   episode, it will somehow have to top this one.  Grade:  (A+)

Abhi Ray:  Too bad this episode didn't reach the high level of meta-humor and
   wit from "138th Episode Spectacular."  This episode should have had more
   comments about past episodes instead of made-up episodes, and the idea of
   the Simpsons being actors kind of confused me.  Nevertheless, this was a
   funny enough episode, with a great Behind the Music parody, and I really
   enjoyed the painkillers joke.  (B)

Eric Sansoni:  This episode's concept is almost irresistible.  The energy
   level is high, and some devices like the past episode tie-ins work great.
   But the satire doesn't approach the "138th Episode" or "Spin-off Showcase"
   level.  Lots of shots are too perfect to fit the documentary style and many
   of the gags, like Jimmy Carter breakdancing, don't exactly rock.  The rise
   to fame, reminiscent of The Monkey's Paw, is enjoyable.  But the breakdown
   and reunion of the family, which should have been the emotional center,
   feel obligatory and underdeveloped.  "Behind the Music's" goal is to reveal
   the humanity behind the celebrity.  Here the writers go overboard
   projecting celebrity onto these familiar humans, obscuring the most
   involving aspect.  (B+)

Robin Steinmann:  A nice seasons final in which they took OFF out of their
   usual reality to fool around a bit for a quite enjoyable spoof.  Not really
   a classic episode, but still better than a lot of S11.  I'm quite sure it
   wasn't meant to be taken serious, it was just a lightweight good-bye for
   the summer.  (B)

Yours Truly:  "Behind the Laughter" exhibits one of the strongest blurrings of
   fantasy and reality that we've seen on "The Simpsons," and does a pretty
   good job of it, too.  All the bases of the Hollywood exposé form are
   covered, from Homer's painkiller addiction, to family bickering, to Lisa's
   tell-all book, to the hilariously over-the-top metaphors.  In fact, there's
   so much material, some of the plot points get the short shrift.  Sketchy
   presentation aside, "Behind the Laughter" is an enjoyable episode.  As the
   announcer might say, we may never look at the Simpsons in the same way
   again.  Or will we?  Yes, we will.  (B)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Meta-reference corner

Damian Penny:  The episode mentions the more outrageous plots the show has
   come up with, and as an example shows "The Principal and the Pauper", voted
   worst episode of all time in an a.t.s. poll.


Benjamin Robinson adds these:  The announcer claims that the cast has
   ballooned over the years.  In the real-life Ullman shorts, there were few
   people outside the core family shown.  Now, it's a cast of hundreds.

   The show also "trotted out" a bunch of "trendy guest stars."  This, too, is
   a source of complaint.

   In her tell-all book, Lisa claims Homer slipped her anti-growth hormones.
   This explains why the kids never age!

   The Sunday strip is mentioned.  Bart mocks its quality, as many people on
   the newsgroup did.


>> Behind the scenes

Benjamin Robinson:  "Tell-all" exposés revealing the secrets of movie stars,
   recording artists, and television actors have been a cottage industry for
   almost as long as we've had movie stars, recording artists, and television
   actors.  One trendy series in this mold is the VH-1 network's "Behind the
   Music," which traces the rise and fall formerly popular musical acts.

   I'll confess to only seeing part of one "Behind the Music," but really the
   format of this show doesn't differ much from its brethren.  An [actor |
   group of actors on a TV series | musician or group] scores big with a new
   [movie | song | series].  A quick ride to the top brings fame and riches,
   but also trouble in the form of [drugs | booze | loose spending | bad
   management | internal strife].  As the subject's fame evaporates, he or she
   goes through [rehab | divorce | the morgue].  Assuming the subject hasn't
   died, he or she moves on to [home life | related career in production |
   unrelated career | undefined].

   Curiously, despite the similarity in plotlines, people never complain about
   plot recycling, the way they do on, say, "The Simpsons."  Shows like this
   remain a sure bet for popularity, partly because the tawdry underside of
   celebrity is strangely fascinating, and partly to reassure ourselves that
   our idols are as human and vulnerable as us unknowns.


James Reisdorf adds:  The popularity of BTM spawned its own little brother,
   BTM2 (using the "trendy" initials), which generally profiles current/recent
   artists whose pasts aren't storied enough to warrant them a spot on the
   original BTM.  Several past musical guest stars on the Simpsons, like
   Willie Nelson, have been on BTM's before.


>> Yeah, but I hear he's got a really sweet mansion for sale

Benjamin Robinson:  MC Hammer (real name:  Stanley something-or-other) might
   make a good "Behind the Music" subject, if he hasn't been on the show
   already.  [Rich Bunnell points out that Hammer was the subject of "Behind
   the Music's" second episode -- Ed.] He had a big hit in "Can't Touch This,"
   a rap/hip-hop tune that sampled a bass line from Rick James' "Superfreak."
   In the video, he wore these amazingly puffy pants, that resembled the
   bottom half of a skydiving suit, only with sequins.  Bart models these, and
   does some Hammer dance moves, when the family takes over his old house.


With that out of the way, Michael Nusair asks the important question:  What
   happened to MC Hammer, anyway?


... and Daniel L. Dreibelbis answers:  from what I remember, after the
   phenomenal success of his PLEASE HAMMER DON'T HURT 'EM album, he then
   managed to commit every possible mistake in the book when it came to his
   career.  For instance, his follow-up recording: when it was charged he was
   a musical lightweight who just used other people's riffs, he responded with
   the two-record 2 LEGIT TO QUIT in which he wrote all the songs himself with
   no samples.  The result was one of the biggest jinxes since the second
   Knack album.  He then further alienated his audience by doing a blatantly
   sexy video for the next release which featured a male dancer who was, well,
   check out the unit on that one.  Last I had heard, several months ago he
   filed for bankruptcy due to some bad investments.


Lord Thistlewick:  And, I believe he is now a minister of some sort.


Andrew Levine:  Newsweek says he's coming out with a new album.  Here's to
   hoping it'll blow Vanilla Ice's second album completely out of the water.


>> Speaking of one-hit wonders

Darrel Jones does just that:  Taco and Falco are both one-hit-wonder acts from
   the 1980's.  The Indonesian Taco's one hit was a synth-heavy remake of the
   1930's song "Puttin' on the Ritz".  Austrian Falco, who is indeed dead
   (killed in an auto accident a couple years back), will forever be
   remembered for his tribute to a more famous Austrian, "Rock Me Amadeus".
   The later song was parodied in the "Dr. Zaius" song from [3F15].


>> Art imitates life

Joe Klemm writes about the Simpsons' real-life albums:  Before the two
   official Simpsons soundtracks, OFF did an album called "The Simpsons Sing
   the Blues."  Released in late 1991, the album features such bits as raps
   songs by Bart, cover songs by the family, and an extended version of the
   "Moaning Lisa Blues" (from Moaning Lisa).  The album was a success, and it
   was followed by "The Yellow Album," though it would be years before it
   would be released due to long delays.


>> "Nine out of ten heavy-metal rockers engage in crazy antics"

Darrel Jones writes:  Ozzy Osbourne is the former lead singer of metal gods
   Black Sabbath.  As a solo act, he's attracted a wide following.  At one of
   his gigs, he bit the head off of a bat, thinking it was dead and stuffed.
   In fact, it was very much alive, and worse still, was also poisonous.  This
   little incident (which the biting of the Grammy referred to) has earned a
   permanent blotch in Ozzy' career.


>> Life imitates Art

The Simpsons on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?  Nah, it couldn't be.  Or could
   it?  Joe Klemm explains:  In 2000, Fox will be having a major celebration
   to commemorate the Simpsons 10th anniversary.  To kick off the festivities,
   the city of Hollywood, on the exact day the show premiered ten years ago,
   added the family to the Walk of Fame, a Hollywood feature where the names
   of celebrities are seen on the stars that make up the sidewalk of
   Hollywood.  The Simpsons now joined such famous animated characters as
   Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny in being part of the Walk of Fame, thus showing
   that they have something very special.


>> Look!  Up in the sky!  It's a bird!  It's a plane!  It's Susan B. Anthony!

Benjamin Robinson writes:  Susan B. Anthony was a famous women's rights
   activist.  Today, she is probably more famous for being on the Anthony
   silver dollar of 1979-80 than for her suffragist activities.  The dollar
   was a big fiasco for the Mint, partly because people preferred the
   traditional paper dollar, and partly because it the coin too closely
   resembled a quarter.  (It may be mean, but it's true:  Anthony's portrait
   closely resembled President Washington's.)  The "Susan B. Anthony Man"
   comic shows the hero holding a shield that resembles the Anthony dollar
   coin.


>> The man with no name

Kay Eliz asks:  Why does everyone on the show keep calling Captain McAllister
   "the sea captain"?  Okay, only two times that I've noticed, but I haven't
   heard him called Captain McAllister since the first episode he was in.  Did
   the writers forget that he has a name or do they think that since he's not
   a really regular character, it's easier for the audience to recognize who
   they're talking about if they just refer to him by what he is?  Or are they
   trying to forget that he ever had a name because they think it's more fun
   for him to not have one, like Comic Book Store Guy?


Nathan DeHoff responds:  I really don't know, but they do similar stuff with
   Bumblebee Man, who was identified as "Pedro" in "Team Homer."


>> The Not-Quite-Forever-ly Brothers

The Simpsons aren't the only family to suffer a messy public breakup, as
   Darrel Jones explains:  The Everly Brothers, real-life brothers Don and
   Phil Everly, were a rockabilly (think early Elvis) act that was widely
   popular in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  By the end of the 1960's,
   though, they were reduced to performing on the "has-been" circuit.
   Tensions were also building between the two.  In a performance at Knott's
   Berry Farm in 1973, one of the two suddenly stormed off the stage in the
   middle of a performance.  Similar to OFF's disastrous Iowa State Fair gig,
   the two spent the next decade apart.  But in 1983, Don and Phil reconciled
   in public, and have been together ever since.


>> Continuity

Nathan DeHoff:  I think this episode was MORE out of continuity than the
   Halloween episodes, in that the Halloween ones have the characters act
   essentially the same way, but in far-out situations.  Also, the first few
   had "framing" sequences that COULD have fit into regular continuity.
   "Behind the Laughter," on the other hand, portrayed the Simpsons as typical
   celebrities who just ACTED like their regular selves when the cameras were
   running.

   While obviously not within regular series continuity, I think this one
   could possibly be considered consistent with one other episode.  That would
   be "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase," which also treated the characters as
   real people. One could possibly also make a case for "The 138th Episode
   Spectacular" as another episode to fit this continuity, but it seemed like
   only Troy McClure was considered "real" in that one.


>> Those Eternal Threads.  Or are they?

 - Where is Springfield

Brad Forman asks:  Is that true?  Do you think they finally revealed where
   Springfield is located?  Or is that just where "the cast" of the show is
   from?  What do you all think?


John Obenauer does some serious sleuthing:  To see whether Kentucky is the
   only state to have both a Springfield and a Shelbyville, I wasted lots of
   valuable time checking MapQuest for every state that had these two cities.
   The results are AR [Arkansas], IL [Illinois], IN [Indiana], KY [Kentucky],
   MI [Michigan], MO [Missouri], TN [Tennessee], and TX [Texas].  Then I
   looked up which states allow first cousin marriages (which supposedly
   Shelbyville was founded to allow).  31 states forbid these marriages, and
   surprisingly, Kentucky is one of them.  States that have no prohibition
   against first cousin marriages are AL [Alabama], AK [Alaska], CA
   [California], CO [Colorado], CT [Connecticut], FL [Florida], GA [Georgia],
   HI [Hawaii], MD [Maryland], MA [Massachusetts], NJ [New Jersey], NM [New
   Mexico], NY [New York], RI [Rhode Island], SC [South Carolina], TN
   [Tennessee], TX [Texas], VT [Vermont], VA [Virginia], and DC [District of
   Columbia] (if you count DC as a state).  The overlap in these lists are
   Texas and Tennessee, interestingly enough.  But maybe Kentucky allowed them
   at the time Shelbyville was founded.  I don't remember what year they said
   Jebediah founded Springfield (and his partner founded Shelbyville), but
   first-cousin marriages were ruled illegal in Kentucky in 1868.

   References, for those who want to similarly waste their time:
   <http://www.law.state.ky.us/civil/bkmarriage.html#Marriage between cousins>

   <http://courses.ksu.edu/spring1999/SASW/ANTH510/lecture/sld008.html>


Kyle Noskoviak:  In addition to Springfield and Shelbyville in KY, there is a
   town called "Simpsonville" not 10 miles down the road from Shelbyville.


Stewart Askew adds:  The Simpsons from Northern Kentucky?!?  I like the fact
   that they only mentioned it in passing so that only the attentive would
   catch it.  And of course, if you look, there is a Shelbyville right north
   of it, a Hogdenville (close enough to Ogdenville) just west, and a
   Simpsonville not far from Shelbyville!  My only question is ... Where the
   hell is North Haverbrook?


Jesse Cook:  Lets just hope there isn't a 742 Evergreen Terrace or someone
   will be covered in calls from crazy fans after tonight.


Not a problem, writes "Doomsdave":  According to Mapqust.com, there is no 724
   Evergreen Terrace in Springfield Kentucky.  It [also] shows that
   Springfield, KY is 42 miles from Shelbyville, KY with 2 towns between them!
   not exactly neighbors, but KY may be the only state that contained both in
   close proximity. No Capital City though.


Don Del Grande wonders:  But since when is Kentucky in "the heartland"?


Sam Alexander:  The Simpsons' beach is an OCEAN BEACH.  It not only has whales
   in it, it also (in several episodes) is used as a transportation/trade
   route.  Remember the shipment of Hot Pants in the "soul mate" episode?
   Remember the time Willy was deported because of the illegal immigrant laws?
   The fact that there's a rocky shoreline and a lighthouse (even one operated
   by E.A.R.L) clearly shows oceanfront.  There (for the geographically
   impaired) is NO OCEAN in Kentucky.  [In addition,] there's no Evergreen
   Terrace (nor Evergreen St., Ct., Ave., Blvd., etc) in Springfield KY.  And
   Texas is only 1200 miles away from Springfield KY, not 2000 like Hank Hill
   said during his cameo in the "football" episode.


Not so fast, says Kieran Murphy:  My atlas must be wrong.  It doesn't show
   Kentucky with a coastline on the pacific.  Which it obviously does if a
   submarine can sail from Springfield harbor to Russia across the Pacific.
   So it's Washington, Oregon or California if I know my geography.  But of
   course it isn't.

   IT'S NOT REAL.


David Levy agrees:  This wasn't a regular episode!  Kang and Kodos were
   featured, for goodness sake!  Do you take the Halloween episodes seriously?

   The Simpsons do NOT live in northern Kentucky.  The "actors" who portray
   "the Simpsons" do.

   This is very simple:  There is no state that fits the all of various
   characteristics which have been exhibited over the years.  The Simpsons
   live in Springfield, U.S.A., an amalgam of our entire nation.

   Like many of the recent jokes (including several in this episode alone) one
   of the main purposes was to rile up the show's rabid fans.  Guess what?  It
   worked.


So does Benjamin Robinson:  Although I resolved not to read the reviews before
   seeing the episode, I couldn't help but notice the activity about
   Springfield, Kentucky. Okay, I heard it, you heard it, and everyone else
   heard it, so I won't belabor the point here.  I will say this episode is
   non-canonical. (Note that, among other things, it flatly contradicts the
   other non- canon behind-the scenes episode, "The Simpsons 138th Episode
   Spectacular (3F31).")  Any "facts" you heard here, including the Simpsons'
   home state, are suspect.

   Besides, don't you think the producers would have made a bigger deal of
   this?  Look at all the hoopla surrounding the revelation of Homer's middle
   name, which was a "smaller" mystery.  I predict the "Where is Springfield"
   crowd will be debating the Simpsons' location for years to come.


Don Del Grande points out some inconsistencies with the Kentucky location and
   past episodes:  5F03: It's less than 2000 miles from "Springfield, KY" to
   "Arlen, TX" regardless of where Springfield can be in Kentucky or Arlen is
   in Texas

   BABF08: Every place that's 12 miles from Kentucky is in the USA


Dr. Trole Ling:  The writers had the same motivation as trolls with that
   little Northern Kentucky ... they knew there was a 'slight' argument for
   the Simpsons to live in Kentucky.  But their real motivation was just to
   stir things up and get people talking ... Just like those damn trolls!


Jeremy Vitrano:  it also shows how none of you can take a JOKE!!!  This whole
   episode was a JOKE!!!  The Simpsons are not really actors!!!  I now HATE
   the state of Kentucky!!!  IT'S IN REVELATIONS, PEOPLE!!!

   I've had my moment.


Eric May:  God, everyone is just obsessed with the joke about Kentucky.  If
   you actually listened and looked at where they were talking about ... you
   can see they were talking about there NEW HOME.

   They moved to Kentucky!!!!  There NEW HOME is in KENTUCKY!  Not the town.


Jeremy Vitrano agrees:  Since they said it at the end I took that as meaning
   that they (the "actors") ended up moving there later.  So where the
   original house was in "real life" was left unnamed.


Bill McNeal:  Just because I'm a New Yorker doesn't mean that I'm from New
   York.  The title just _describes_ me without referencing where I live.


Eric Sansoni:  I don't understand the uproar over this Kentucky thing.  Were
   people not paying enough attention to the show to realize the whole point
   was to reveal who the Simpsons were behind the scenes of their show, not on
   it?  Just because Kentucky is where the real-life Simpsons live, does not
   mean that is where their show is set.  The vast majority of films and shows
   are recorded in locations that do not match the fictional location they
   represent.  For example, Rumble in the Bronx was filmed in Canada.


Michael Nusair:  Yeah, but I'm pretty sure they said that they filmed the
   "show" in the same house they actually lived in.  I guess later they moved
   into MC Hammer's house, but that was still in plain view of their other
   house -- the one they filmed the show in.


"The Incarnate":  No, they only said they did that for Homer's 'My Funny
   Family'.  I think that if they got a show, they would build them a house
   set on the studio lot or whatever, since they sure couldn't build all the
   other sets they needed for the show inside the house.

   Plus, it only said that they were "a Northern Kentucky family".  Not that
   the show was set there, and not even that they (the Simpsons actors) still
   lived there.  That could mean that they used to live in Kentucky, and moved
   somewhere else before they even started the show.


Eric Sansoni:  But my point is it doesn't matter where they filmed it.  It
   could still be in their original house in Kentucky.  But that doesn't mean
   that's the same place they call the setting of their fictional universe.
   They might film some gritty New York drama in Chicago.  If Luke Skywalker
   never named the planet he lived on, you wouldn't assume it's Earth just
   because you found out the show was filmed on the Tunisian desert of Earth.
   So The Simpsons might film a story about a quirky town in Oregon back at
   their home in Kentucky. Just because they've never told us if it's Oregon
   or something else doesn't mean you should assume it's set in Kentucky, just
   because behind-the-scenes you found out it's filmed there.


Adam Long looks at the bigger picture:  You know, after reading all these
   posts I've come to realize that the Kentucky thing is the greatest "Where
   is Springfield?" gag ever, since this time it's not arguing if the
   suspected state fits topographically, but rather it's arguing whether the
   episode was "real" or not, which is even more pointless. The writers sure
   do know how to shake this group up.


Tony Garossino:  Yes that's right people OFF does not live in the real world.
   There is no five corners in the real world, there is no way the Simpsons
   could live in a town that switches from the east to the west coast weekly.
   They don't live in Kentucky, they live in Springfield.  Springfield
   represents any town America, it's not located at any specific place because
   it's not real.  Saying they live in Kentucky is like saying that the entire
   family is inside out because of a Halloween episode.  The season finale was
   not in continuity, got it?


A lady named Gina argues:  There was never an intentional real-life location
   of Springfield from the shows inception, there is no "master plan" for the
   Simpsons so like everything else you see in the show, facts are dependent
   on the writer who pens each individual episode -- and after that, each
   "fact" is just another fictional segment of a fictional series which,
   however creative its beginnings and whatever satire and wit has been
   injected into it, still exists only to expose you to about 10 minutes of
   advertising per week.


Dale G. Abersold answers:  Okay, here's the deal, Gina.  On the one hand, you
   score highly for perceiving that the "Where is Springfield" thing is a
   running gag written by many different hands over the course of the years.
   On the other hand, your powers of observation have served you less well as
   far as reading the collective minds of Simpsons fandom.  You have missed
   the fact that the "Where is Springfield" thing is something that people
   actually do for fun.


Eric Endres:  After the nonchalantly wonderful way that KY was revealed as
   Springfield's state, whether you think of last night's ep as being out of
   continuity or not (and I don't think it has to be thought of that way, in
   the way the Halloween eps are ...), I think they should stick with KY as
   the state.  I mean, it's been 11 seasons now.  There are, or should be,
   other running gags to explore and expand.  And they can probably even get a
   good gag or two out of swinging the opposite way with the whole thing now
   and then; i.e. Kentucky signs 'suddenly' seem to be everywhere, the school
   kids sing a big ode to Kentucky during an assembly, etc.  All as part of
   the background of whatever else is going on, but noticeable enough to be
   yet another subtle extension of the whole gag.


David Levy:  This was "Behind the Laughter", a documentary.  Right?  Even if
   you refuse to accept that last night's episode took place outside of the
   program's regular continuity, how about these possibilities: (occurring
   within the fictional storyline)

   The Simpsons are tired of being swarmed by fans, so they requested that the
   announcer deliberately mention the incorrect state.  OR the announcer (or
   the typist of his script) simply made a mistake.

   I'm done being reasonable!  Now I'm playing your game, people!  It feels
   good to be stubborn!  :)


Eli K. Eldridge theorizes:  It was all a clever deception.  The Simpsons are
   not from Springfield, KY or ANY Springfield in the US of A at all.  They
   are in fact from Wilmington, Delaware.  You see, the mention of vacationing
   there was just a clever ruse to explain their presence if they are ever
   detected.


Tongue (presumably) in cheek, "Hoff" contributes:  hi, i'm logged in from a
   salt mine in khazakstan.  i'm seven hundred feet below the surface, and a
   three-day uphill snowy trek from the nearest electrical socket.  but, i
   just heard that the Simpsons live in Kentucky ...  da? nyet?


Ben Kruse:  I though the Kentucky line was hilarious and knew that some people
   would take it as fact.  Don't, it's a bit.  In fact, let's rest the whole
   "Which State" debate all together, there is no answer.

   I would like to recommend the following debates to take its place:

   Will this show ever end seeing that the writing is still Grade-A verbal
   art?

   How does Rupert Murdoch put up with this abuse?

   Who does Ted Turner think he is?

   Reasons a Simpsons movie is a bad idea.

   Why won't the Emmy's let "The Simpsons" into the Outstanding Comedy Series
   category?

   Professor Frink, Man or Super-Man?


Dale G. Abersold has the last word:  I maintain that there is no such place as
   Kentucky.


 - No, really.  Where *is* Springfield?

Dino Scoppettone:  The bet here is that in one of the first episodes next
   season, there will be a throwaway line that completely contradicts the
   "Behind the Laughter" line.


[Actually, we didn't even have to wait that long.  For the repeat airing on
   July 12, the voice-over changed to, "Southern Missouri family" -- Ed.]


Maximilien Robespierre points out:  It's dumb for the writers to think anyone
   would believe they are from Missouri, considering Springfield Elementary
   was moved from there brick by brick.  Not only that, but Abe will be deep
   in the cold ground before he recognizes Missourah!


Rebekah Garringer:  When they first played Behind the Laughter I laughed so
   hard at the Kentucky line.  I thought that the writers threw it in to keep
   everyone at ATS buzzing all summer long.  Now that they have changed the
   line to Missouri, I'm sure of it.  I can just see them laughing at all of
   us and thinking we need to get a life.


Arup Baral:  Ahh, somehow they switched it up on us.  I knew it wasn't
   Northern Kentucky.  I think it'll change every rerun.


Chris Palm:  Something tells me when it goes into syndication there'll be
   different lines for each individual state.  For instance, when it airs in
   Boston, it may very well be eastern Massachusetts.


Bill McNeal:  Yes, it will change EVERY time it's aired.  Which means that the
   episode can only be aired 48 more times for the rest of eternity, right?


Don Del Grande writes:  It'll probably be like "Lisa the Greek" -- when it
   makes it to syndication, it will go back to "northern Kentucky".  And when
   the Season 10 DVDs come out (probably sometime between 2005 and 2010),
   they'll probably have two audio tracks where the only difference is that
   one says Kentucky and the other Missouri


From the Great White North, J. C. White reports:  Canadian Global network
   affiliates and NTV Newfoundland aired the original "Northern Kentucky"
   ending of the Behind the laughter episode last night.  So far, I've seen
   the "Southern Missouri" ending only on Fox.


R. M. Crusoe has what might be the best answer:  Personally I think
   Springfield is just a state of mind.  Springfield is all around you.  How
   many times have you gone into a Kwik-E-Mart and paid Apu for a Squishee?
   Can anyone really say that Edna Crabapple was never their teacher in grade
   school?  Everybody has listened to Bleeding Gums Murphy, or met Barney
   Gumble, or had a run-in with Chief Wiggum.  And there is certainly a little
   Bart in all of us.  Look around ... Jebediah Springfield is probably
   immortalized in bronze somewhere in your town, even of the name on the
   plaque is different. Who was Bozo?  Why, just a cheap-ass wannabe Krusty
   imitation.  Didn't you watch Itchy and Scratchy on TV when you were a kid?
   Sure you did. Your mind is just playing tricks on you, trying to tell you
   that the names were "Tom" and "Jerry".  Now really ... what the hell kind
   of names for a cat and a mouse are THOSE?  Look around you, fellow
   Springfielders.  You ARE wherever you perceive yourself to BE.

          turns negative and black and white, then burns]
Homer: [interviewed backstage] Everybody wanted a piece of us.
Marge: [interviewed on the lawn] They told us what to wear, how to dress,
       which clothes we should put on.
Bart:  [interviewed at the playground] The cops found me driving on the
       sidewalk.
Lisa:  [interviewed in her room] I had no business hosting the Oscars.  After

         [Slow motion shot of Meryl Streep's spit flying through the air; spit
          hits a picture of Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa on the Simpsons'

Narr.: Tonight: the Simpsons as you've never seen them before, on "Behind the

         [A hammer comes in from offscreen and breaks each fragment of the
          picture further]
-- "Behind the Laughter"
 
% The theme song for "behind the Laughter" comes on, which is the theme from
% VH1's "Behind the Music".  Negative tinted monochromatic clips from The
% Simpsons are shown:  Marge shoots a pistol from "The Springfield

% eyeball from "Lard of the Dance", Bart runs from Homer down the stairs from
% "Bart's Friend Falls in Love", Lisa plays her new saxophone from "Lisa's

%
% Bird's eye view of Springfield, as the narrator identifies this as the
% site of the family's journey into show business.  As he introduces the
% children, we see old home movies of what they were like as babies.
% Young Bart puts a water hose in car's gas tank; Marge yanks it out.
% Sometime during the winter, young Lisa walks out on the snow's surface,
% then sinks into it; Marge digs her out.  Finally, Maggie scribbles with
% a marker all over Homer, who is sleeping on the couch; Marge runs over,
% but, indifferent, lets it continue.

Marge: Nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids.  They almost drove me to
       fortified wine.
Homer: Then we figured out we could park them in front of the TV.  That's how
       I was raised, and I turned out TV.
Ned:   [interviewed on his couch] I'd see 'em sitting on that couch all day
       long, just staring at that Hollywood hogwash.
Homer: Our favorite show was "Hollywood Hogwash", but we also loved "The Dreck
       Squad"...
Marge: ..."The Malarkeys", "Dumbin' it Down"...
Lisa:  ..."Sheriff Lowbrow"...
Bart:  ..."Home Improvement"...
Homer: ...but we never saw people like *us* on TV.
Bart:  TV families were always hugging and tackling issues.
Marge: Homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show.  Finally I
       said, "So do it.  Either [bleep] or get off the pot."
Narr.: And [bleep] he did.  Using his home as the studio and his family as the
       cast, this penniless Peckinpah shot a crude five minute video.

            coming to dinner and I need a clean shirt.
     Marge: I haven't done the laundry yet.
     Homer: Mama mia!  Now I'll have to do it!  [walks over to a washing
            machine in the hallway and pours detergent in]
     Lisa:  Dad, that's too much detergent--
     Homer: Not now, I'm busy turning on this washing machine.
              [suds flow from the top of the machine and start filling the

            labeled "Boss"] Simpson!  Where's my dinner?!
     Homer: Mama mia!
-- "Behind the Laughter"

Lisa:  It was amazing how fast Dad betrayed his vision of a realistic show.
Marge: Okay, the material was a little corny, but Homer and I had real
       chemistry onscreen.
Homer: Every day I thought about firing Marge ... you know, just to shake
       things up.

%
% Things don't get much easier when Homer finally arrives in Hollywood.
% ABC, NBC, and Telemundo all reject the Homer's pilot.  As luck would
% have it Marge's hairdresser was also the Fox network's president.
% He evidently agrees to hear Homer's pitch, and Fox likes it enough to

% Mr. Murdoch needs a little coaching to get the job done.

Bart:  The funniest stuff came right out of real life.
               [Rehearsal footage: Homer and Bart sit on the front couch]

     Bart:     Cowabunga, dude!
     Director: And, cut.
     Bart:     Dad, I've never said "cowabunga" in my life!  Your script

Krusty: [interviewed in his dressing room] Yeah, I've seen all the overnight
        sensations -- Brad Hall, Rich Hall, Rich Little, Little Richard -- but

        Krustophenia sits on the shelf!
Lisa:   None of us had ever sung before, but Mr. Geffen believed in us.
     All Simpsons: [playing tambourines in recording studio and singing]

%
% A parade is arranged for the family.  Crowds in the street cheer as the

Narr.:  But behind the streamers and confetti, storm clouds were gathering.
         [Storm clouds block the sun]
       *Figurative* storm clouds.
         [The clouds leave]
Moe:   [interviewed in the bar] Oh, Homer was spending money like a teenage
       Arab -- heh.  He bought me a Rolex and, uh, Cashmere jeans.  I felt
       kinda guilty 'cause I was always trying to score with his wife.  So,
       when do we start filming?  [looks at camera] ...Oh.
Lenny: [interviewed on the curb outside Moe's alongside Carl] Even Bart was
       throwing dough around.  He paid me and Carl a thousand bucks to kiss
       each other.
Carl:  Hey, did we ever get that money?
Narr.: But reckless spending and interracial homoeroticism were just volume
       one of the Encyclopedia Self-Destructica.

-- The start of money trouble, "Behind the Laughter"

Narr.: Even more harrowing were the events of one April afternoon.
         [An April calendar pops out of a jack-in-a-box]
Bart:  The script originally called for *me* to jump the gorge, but I had been
       up all night paying people to kiss, so Dad volunteered to do the stunt.
Homer: [watching the gorge jump from "Bart the Daredevil"] Everything was
       going great at first; I felt like I was king of the world.
Homer: [on tape] I'm king of the world!  Whoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo!
Homer: Right about here I realize something's wrong.  Yup, there I go.
       [rolling down the cliff] Then came the rocks -- jagged rocks, hitting
       me with their jags.
Narr.: The sequence became an instant comedy classic, but what the audience
       didn't see was the unfunny aftermath.
         [In the hospital, Homer, with many casts, tries to walk using
          handrails but snaps his other leg.  He collapses to the ground
          screaming, but when the nurse dumps pills in his mouth, he stops]
       Somehow, Homer became addicted to painkillers.  It was the only way he
       could perform the bone-cracking physical comedy that made him a star.
         ["Little Big Mom": Homer gets hit in the crotch with mounds of snow
          when skiing; "Lard of the Dance": Willie pounds Homer in the vent;

          Our Lisa": mayhem in the cherry picker; "Sideshow Bob Roberts":
          Homer rams into the chimney clinging to a wrecking ball; "A Milhouse
          Divided": Bart breaks a chair on Homer]
Homer: Why did I take much punishment?  Let's just say that fame was like a
       drug, but what was even more like a drug was the drugs.
-- Homer's drug addiction, "Behind the Laughter"

% In spite of the behind-the-scenes issues, the family's star kept rising
% "like a plastic bag caught in an updraft."  Speaking of star's the
% Simpsons are awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, near Milton
% Berle, Nelson Mandela, and the Cheerios Honey Bee.
%
% Although the awards kept rolling in, the Simpson's earnings kept
% rolling out.  Comic Book Guy reports that when Lisa tried to buy a
% rare comic at his store, the check "bounced higher than Rubber Girl."

Narr.:   Where did the money go?  Marge lost much of the family fortune
         investing in birth control products.
Marge:   I learned something -- when people reach for their diaphragm, they
         don't want to see my picture.
-- Some lessons are easier than others, "Behind the Laughter"

Narr.:   As the Simpsons' money dwindled, their expenses soared.  From the
         original group of five, the cast ballooned to dozens, then hundreds.
Wiggum:  [interviewed outside his police car] I'd never acted before in my
         life, but, uh, if the sea captain could be in the show, why not me?
         I've even got a catch phrase -- N'yeah!  Wah!  Wah-wah-wah!  No, I
         lost it.
Narr.:   Then, another bombshell: an anonymous tipster alerted Uncle Sam that
         the Simpsons were evading their income taxes.
Apu:     [interviewed in a shadow in the Kwik-E-Mart] Yes, I finked on Homer,
         but, you know, he deserved it.  Never have I seen such abuse of the
         take-a-penny/leave-a-penny tray.
Narr.:   The tax men were merciless.
             [IRS men vacuum  Homer's gold jewelry off him; another tows
              away the mansion with a tractor.
    Homer: Hey, they can't take our house; my potbellied pig is in there!
            [sobbing] Oh, Mr. Porky....
-- The money trouble worsens, "Behind the Laughter"

Narr.: Inevitably, the behind-the-scenes turmoil took its toll on their TV
       series.
     Director: And action!
               [aborted couch gag: OFF sits down on the couch in western
                clothes, but Bart is missing]
               Hold on, cut.
                 [the family grumbles]
               Bart, if it's not too much trouble....
     Bart:     [being massaged and having his toenails files, he talks into a
               cellular phone] Fine, I'll do "Teen Wolf Three".  I've got fair
               weather friends to feed.  [high fives man holding the phone]
     Lisa:     Dad, I want to go to bed.  Aren't there child labor laws?
     Homer:    [defensive] Who told you about those laws?  Was it Marge?
     Marge:    Hey, you've been riding me all day.  Why don't you poop in your
               hat?
     Kang:     Are you going to need us tonight?
     Kodos:    I have ballet tickets, not that they'll do much good now.
-- Trouble on the set, "Behind the Laughter"

% The family's troubles took their toll on the show.  Plots became more
% gimmicky and outlandish, as in "The Principal and the Pauper."  Trendy
% guest stars, like Stephen Hawking, Butch Patrick, and Gary Coleman
% appear in a bid to boost the ratings.
%
% But that wasn't all.  Bart judges a Miss Hawaiian Tropic beauty contest
% at the Sheraton Haleakalualea.  On the way home, he gets into a scuffle
% with the flight attendants on a Hawaiian Airlines jet.  He's led off the
% plane in handcuffs, covering his face in shame.  While cools his heels in
% rehab, his friend Richie Rich substituted for him on TV.  Ratings for
% the show plateau, then sharply plummet.

Narr.: Desperate to polish their tarnished image, the family agreed to a live
       appearance at the Iowa State Fair.
Lisa:  Right from the start I had a bad feeling about that gig.
Narr.: It was an evening that none of them would ever forget ... or would
       they?  No.
             [On an outdoor stage at the fair, the Simpsons come out wearing
              large ceramic heads of themselves [see comments section], then
              they take them off]
     Homer:  Hello, Iowa!  Does anyone have a doughnut?
               [uproarious laughter]
     Marge:  Now Homer, this is no time to be thinking about food.
     Bart:   Yeah, forget the doughnuts, we're here to *go* nuts!
             ...musically, that is.
     Lisa:   What kind of songs should we play?
     Marge:  Something that swings, with the beat of New Orleans.
     Homer:  No, something that rocks!  That's the sound of today!
     Marge:  Swings!
     Homer:  Rocks!
     Girls:  Swings!
     Boys:   Rocks!
Narr.: Sadly, this argument was not part of the act.
     Homer:  I'll kill you! 
     Marge:  You don't have the guts, little man!
     Lisa:   [takes microphone] Folks, we're just having a little family tiff,
             if you'll just bear with us --
     Bart:   Oh, shut up!  Always trying to act so mature!  I'm glad you make
             the least money!
     Lisa:   Oh, that's it!  [tackles Bart]
               [The rest of the family starts fighting]
Narr.: Before a riot could break out, Jimmy Carter came to the rescue with his
       comedy break dancing.
     Carter: [singing] Got a brother named Billy
             And my teeth look silly
             Break it down, now [break dances]
               [the audience cheers for Carter while security restrains the
                Simpson family; the ceramic Homer head rolls off the stage and
                smashes in slow motion]
Narr.: The dream was over.  Coming up: was the dream really over?  Yes it was.
       Or was it?  And Homer finds a new passion: dusting and polishing mixing
       boards.  [Homer does] When "Behind the Laughter" continues.
-- Tempers flare at the Iowa State Fair, "Behind the Laughter"

% [End of Act Two.  Act Time: 7:41  Running Time: 14:49]

Narr.: The Simpsons' TV show started out on a wing and a prayer, but now the
       wing was on fire, and the prayer had been answered ... by Satan.  After
       the state fair fiasco, none of the family were speaking to each other.
       Fox put the show on hiatus and replaced it with hidden camera footage
       from the dressing room at Ann Taylor.
Homer: That slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing.  It gave us a
       chance to pursue solo projects.  I returned to my first love: the
       legitimate theater.       
             [Rent II: Condo Fever: Two young women stand in front of a door]
     Artist: As a young female artist, I really love living in this east
             village loft.
               [knock on door]
             Oh, that must be our new landlord, Mr. Stingly.
     Homer:  [comes through the door dressed in black, a cape, top hat and
             fake mustache; laughs evilly; sings] Where is the rent?  I must
             have the rent.  Dollars, dimes, and nickels -- I need them all
             right now!   
Homer: [holding a piece of fake wall with a bite out of it] I literally chewed
       the scenery.
-- Homer's solo project, "Behind the Laughter"

% The other family members also had solo projects.  Bart replaced Lorenzo
% Lamas on "Renegade."  Marge created a nightclub act that featured
% her rendition of "I Shot the Sherriff."  She closes the song by telling
% the audience, "the next time you see a sheriff, shoot him ... a smile!"

Narr.: Lisa "sang", too, in a tell-all book blasting the family.
             [Lisa talks on a stage about her book "Where Are My Residuals"]
     Lisa: To prolong the run of the series, I was secretly given antigrowth
           hormones.
             [reporters gasp]
Homer: That's ridiculous.  How could I even get all five necessary drops into
       her cereal?  [pause] What?
-- Lisa's solo project, "Behind the Laughter"

% Needless to say, the book does nothing to mend the growing divisions
% between the family members.  In fact, nobody really seemed to get along.
% That Thanksgiving, everyone brought his or her lawyer to dinner.  Even
% the most innocuous comments brought the threat of lawsuits and counter-
% suits.

It was the best Thanksgiving ever.  I mean, emotionally, it was terrible,
but the turkey was so moist!
--Homer's Thanksgiving with lawyers, "Behind the Laughter"

Narrator: The carcass of the Simpsons' empire had been picked clean, but then
          came help from an unexpected source.
Hibbert:  [interviewed at his desk] I knew there was only one person who could
          reunite this troubled clan: my old fraternity brother, Willie
          Nelson.
W.Nelson: [interviewed in his bus; robot arms braid his hair] I'd do anything
          for Kegmeister Julius, so I cooked up a phony awards show.  [robot
          display reads "hair jam"] Not again!  Time saver, my ass!
Bart:     When Willie asked me to be a presenter at the New Awareness Awards,
          I had to think about it ... for about a microsecond!
Marge:    You just don't say no to the redheaded stranger ... and when I heard
          that it was for awareness, that sealed the deal!
Narrator: Would Willie's fence-mending eggs bear fruit?  Or would his olive
          branch be torn apart by woodpeckers of mistrust?
-- "Behind the Laughter"

% At the New Awareness Awards presentation, Willie Nelson hosts.  A man
% finishes playing a song.

Narr.: That night, fate wore a cummerbund ... of suspense!
     W.Nelson: Thank you, Taco, for that loving tribute to Falco.  Now, to
               present the award for most violent rap group, Homer Simpson!
                 [Homer walks on from left stage]
               And Marge Simpson!
                 [Marge and Maggie walk on from right stage]
     Homer:    What's she doing here?!
     W.Nelson: And Bart and Lisa Simpson!
                 [Bart is lowered from a crescent moon and Lisa rises out of
                  the floor]
     Lisa:     Hey, what's going on?
     W.Nelson: Well, I'll be honest.  The New Awareness Awards are all an
               elaborate sham.
     W.Allen:  [in audience, with many awards] What?  I knew it was too good
               to be true.  [throws awards to floor]
                 [The Simpsons turn their backs to each other]
     Lisa:     So this whole thing was just a trick to get us back together.
     W.Nelson: Well, I'm also trying to patch thing up between Van Halen and
               Sammy Hagar.
                 [In the audience, they humph and turn their backs]
               But the main thing is for you folks to stop this silly feud,
               isn't that right, people?
                 [The crowd cheers, then chants "hug"; the Simpsons eventually
                  do and the audience cheers again; Willie Nelson's two
                  ponytails raise a la Pippi Longstocking]
-- The Simpsons reunite, "Behind the Laughter"

% The Simpsons sit on a grassy hill beside a pond.

Narr.: The Simpsons' bitter past was forgotten, and now the future looks
       brighter than ever for this northern Kentucky (*) family.
       [(*) Replaced with "southern Missouri" on subsequent airings;
        see "Comments" section for more]
Homer: We put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to
       what matters: the show ... and the Sunday comic strip.
Marge: Which Homer writes himself.
Bart:  So you *know* it's great! [winks]
Homer: Why you little...!  [chokes Bart]
Narr.: So whether choking their son or poking some fun, the Simpsons will keep
       on gagging for years to come.
