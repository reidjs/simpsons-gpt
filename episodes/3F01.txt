The cereal box calls them Frosty (not Frosted) Krusty Flakes.  {ddg}

It looks as though Marge has only one spa certificate in some scenes.
{ddg}

The trash and food stains don't appear until Marge mentions them.  {dh2}

Lice don't hop around: they attach themselves to the scalp and don't
move.  {rl}

Lice don't make sounds.  {dh2}

Milhouse isn't shuddering and pale until Bart makes his comment.  {rl}

Although Skinner undoubtedly learned about burning clothes to kill lice
in Vietnam, it doesn't work.  {ddg}

Since when does Lisa have prescription shoes?

Why would the "All is well" tape have to be _rewound_ after it is turned
over?  {fb}

The female child welfare agent's clipboard appears magically.  {dh}

Lou and the barricade appear magically.  {dh}

When Homer and Marge look at Bart and Lisa in the van the window doesn't
show what's inside the van.  {jp}

Lisa's tooth that fell out was a molar, yet it fell from the incisor
region of her mouth.  {sng}

Lisa's lisp disappears, and her tooth grows back magically.  {ddg}

Lisa claims the tooth that falls out is a baby tooth, but then the
braces she got in 9F15 would be useless.  {wp}

Grampa only appears when Homer yells at him.  {dh}

Homer's houseplant appears magically.  {fb}

The dining room doorway arch changes widths.  {dh2}

The judge from 1F20 now has a different voice.

The judge from 1F20 says, "I just can't say `no' to kids," but seems
remarkably cooler towards kids in this episode.

The judge's hourglass doesn't have sand running through it as it should,
and it disappears from her bench.  {dh2}

The notice on the front door doesn't appear until Marge reads it.  {dh2}

The guy with the spiked bracelets moves from the front of the class to
the back.  {rl}

Some of the other class members change positions.  {dh2}

Surely Flanders should know I&S's reputation from 7F09?  {fb}

Nachos disappear from the tray.  {jp}

Bart and Lisa's dinner plates change into bowls.  {fb}

Nonfat ice milk usually has sugar, just like ice cream, but in "Homer
Loves Flanders", Maude said that Todd and Rod aren't allowed to eat
anything with sugar.  {ddg}

If Lisa's statement that her parents are ten feet away is accurate, the
court order of 100 feet is being violated.  {fb}

Homer and Marge _could_ have gone to a pay phone if they'd really wanted
to call the kids.  {rl}

Marge was separated from the kids for six weeks in 8F24, so why can't
she handle a week now?  {fb}

Bart doesn't really say "dude" after things -- much more like him to say
"man".  {rl}

Wouldn't Lisa take her saxophone with her?  {ddg}

Todd calls for the "St. James" bible -- doesn't he mean the _King_ James
version?

The Vulgate Bible of St. Jerome is in Latin, as should have been the
questions derived from it.  {th}

It's surprising that Lisa didn't get any bible questions right,
especially given her concern about her mortal soul in 7F13.  {by}

Maggie disappears just before Ned faints.  {dh}

Why would Flanders have "Fire" and "Police" on autodial?  They're 911.
[or 912, if you're a Stonecutter - ed] {dh2}

Homer's car starts out facing the same way as Flanders', but when he
walks between them, the cars become perpendicular.  {fb}

The trees on the hill down to the river change from vertical, to
perpendicular to the slope, back to vertical again.  {dh2}

The Flanderses are not Baptists, since that faith, alone among
mainstream Protestants, does not practice infant baptism.  They must
not, therefore, be members of _any_ mainstream denomination, since they
were practicing baptism by immersion, and the Baptists alone do that
among the mainstream Protestants.  Since the Simpsons go to the same
church, ditto for them.  {th}

It's unlike Marge to laugh at the Flanders family.  {rl}

===============================================================================
> Reviews
===============================================================================
Mark Livingstone: This has to be one of the best episodes in quite a
    while.  I say it goes right up there with Lisa's Wedding in my
    books.

Mark Richey: A pretty good episode.  I'm not sure if it proved that
    Marge and (especially) Homer were good parents, but it sure was
    funny to see what living with the Flanders was like.  It's also
    interesting to find out that Homer's not the only one who can't
    stand Ned (and that Lovejoy is a model train collector).  Overall
    grade: A-.

Edward Isabella: Does anyone else agree that there is something missing
    this season?  It seems like the voices are a bit different and that
    the plot lines have a horrible "Critic"-esque quality.  They just
    aren't as good as the weekday reruns.

Dennis Miller: This evening's episode had its moments, but I found it
    hard to laugh about child abuse and neglect.  There are parents like
    Marge's classmates.  There are examples of case workers run amok.
    The writers attempted to comment on how misplaced our enforcement of
    child welfare laws are.  I just had trouble finding it funny.

Ben Parrish: This was the first episode of The Simpsons where I didn't
    even laugh once.  Pretty sad.

Brad Lascelle: Grade: B. A strong effort by Jon Vitti that provides some
    warmth, depth, and much-needed character development to a show which
    has run short of story ideas.  A little too sharp to the bone for
    its own good on issues of religion and child neglect.

Tommy Fallin: I was glad to see that this season has finally given an
    episode that was good from beginning to end.  It reminded me that
    sometimes the Simpsons transcends the gimmicky cartoon laughs it
    focuses on sometimes, and actually portrays the feelings of a real,
    though still quirky, family.  A+.

Ricardo Lafaurie: It started off slow but built up to an _excellent_
    episode.  Maybe I'm just starved for real quality, but it really
    shines in comparison to the past two episodes.  I just loved the
    whole baptism thing.  Plus the old Homer that we haven't seen in
    eons!  My grade: A-

Ivan Troy: This was the first episode in ages in which the characters
    showed normal personalities and were not just charicatures of each
    other.  The "Stupid babies need the most attention" and the "All I
    need is a little LSD" lines and the whole baptism scene had me ROTFL
    more than any new episode in quite a while.  Grade: A-

Dominik Halas: An absolutely _brilliant_ episode.  The plot was strong
    and well-knit, there weren't any unfunny tangential jokes that drag
    on forever, the characterization was right on, Homer wasn't a
    complete idiot, and there were tons of hilarious lines.  IMHO this
    episode will rank among the all-time greats.  Grade: A+.

Don Del Grande: A-minus - call me crazy, but I liked this one better
    than the previous two.  (For some reason, the episodes I like the
    best usually originally sound like they're going to be bad
    episodes.)  I do wish they would have come up with something better
    for Maggie to say than "Da-diddily-doodily".

Benjamin Robinson: Another fine effort of the kind that we used to take
    for granted two years ago.  In particular, the improbable
    coincidences that led to the kids' removal, and the scene where Bart
    and Lisa discover they miss their parents, were well handled.  In
    all, this episode is on a par with "Radio Bart" and "Bart the
    Lover."  (9/11 -> A)

Aaron Varhola: With the exception of "Lisa's Wedding", the first
    genuinely touching episode since "Homer's Triple Bypass".  Although
    some of the gags misfired, and the ending could have been better,
    the emotional parts hit home, the satire of child welfare agencies'
    mistakes was effective, and Akom did an incredible job with the
    animation.  A.

Keith Palmer: The characterization and gags complimented themselves
    quite nicely in this episode, and it was a pleasant flashback, to a
    time when the Simpsons were a dysfunctional family struggling to
    survive in a more perfect world.  I even liked Maggie's line.
    Grade: A.

Tony Hill: This was a fabulously funny episode, with the best lines
    being "stupid babies need the most attention" and Homer's remark
    about the starfish.  It was a classic OFF plot where the day begins
    nearly normal and then things start to snowball, a la "Stark Raving
    Dad."  There was hardly any deviation from the main plot.  I give it
    an A!

Yours truly: A very strong episode, character-rather than gag-driven.
    It was full of moving scenes, and when the jokes _were_ present,
    they were smoothly integrated and hilarious to boot.  And the
    animation was sharp.  I'd love to see Ned on Jeopardy answering
    questions from a biblical category.  Grade: A.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> "America Loves Ted Kennedy"

Tony Hill expounds, "Polls showed that Sen.  Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass)
    would be a leading contender for the 1980 Democratic Presidential
    nomination against Jimmy Carter in the summer of 1979.  In the next
    several months, just about _every_ newspaper, magazine and TV
    newscast did a report on the 1969 Chappaquiddick scandal - which
    voters had largely forgotten.  In that incident, a twentysomething
    female passenger in the Senator's car, Mary Jo Kopechne, had drowned
    in an unusual accident on Chappaquiddick Island off the coast of
    Massachusetts.  It is believed that Kennedy, while drunk, had driven
    off a narrow bridge while entertaining a woman not his wife, while
    unbeknownst to them, Kopechne was asleep in the backseat.  Kennedy
    pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of the accident.  Following all
    the fresh publicity, Kennedy's presidential campaign foundered, and
    he has never since been a contender, although he continues to
    represent Massachusetts in the Senate."

>> Springfield Bentley

Benjamin Robinson explains, "The car that Homer test-drove (or something
    close to it) actually exists.  It's a Bentley Azure, recently
    introduced as the flagship of the Bentley range.  Essentially the
    convertible version of the Continental R, I believe the Azure shares
    with it a turbocharged V8 good for about 385bhp.  The Azure also
    sports a price tag of around US$350,000.  I'm surprised Springfield
    Bentley (they sell Bentley but not Rolls-Royve?  How did that
    happen?) let Homer near the thing."

>> "40 Trampled at Poco Concert"

Aaron Varhola says, "This headline refers to the tragedy at a Who
    concert in Cincinnatti in 1978, where 12 fans were crushed to death
    in a stampede for general admission tickets.  (This event was
    handled well by a WKRP episode, when Herb Tarlek gives tickets to
    nerdy newsman Les Nessman, and he enjoys the concert, until he finds
    out what happened.)  Poco is a folk-rock group from the mid-late
    70's, and its fans would hardly cause a stampede."

>> The Swartzwelder statue

Aaron Varhola says the statue "is a perfect likeness of Simpsons writer
    John Swartzwelder.  He also appears as the author of `How to Make a
    Fortune Writing Cartoons' in 9F16; one of the writers goofing off in
    the writers' room in 9F16; and as one of Burns' `dead ringers' in
    8F13.  He also has the neighboring county named after him."

>> Captioning notes

When Flanders pulls the air horn from the emergency baptism kit, it
    plays a couple of lines of the "Hallelujah" chorus from Handel's
    "Messiah".  But as both Ricardo Lafaurie and I noticed, the closed
    captioning has the line "'Tis a gift to be simple" instead.  It is
    likely that the original tune was overdubbed with the more familiar
    one after the captioners had finished with the episode.

>> "Batman" references

Ricardo Lafaurie lists the following previous episode references to
    "Batman":

    - 7F21: Bart grabs comic book receptionist and says "I'm Bartman"
      (movie)
    - 8F15: spinning background and Bart's head
    - 8F20: "To the Simpson-mobile!"
    - 9F07: Adam West (the original Batman) guest stars, and drives the
      Batmobile
    - 9F15: Lisa smashes the mirror like the Joker
    - 9F15: Burns and Smithers slide down poles
    - 2F17: campy '70s Radioactive Man
    - 3F01: spinning background and state seal

       history project.
 Lisa: Wow, Mom.  You didn't have to go to _this_ much trouble.

    Ned: Looks like I'm going to have to baptise you myself.
          [breaks open the Emergency Baptism kit]
          [presses an air horn which plays a bit of the "Hallelujah"
         chorus from Handel's "Messiah"]
-- A poor substitute for Gabriel's trumpet, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-
    Dum-Doodily"

% Homer and Marge come home.  The police start dismantling the
% barricades while the parents go next door to get their kids.

Homer: Kids!  We're good parents now.  Get your asses out here!
Marge: We've missed you so much.
        [they gasp at the "Gone Baptizin'" sign on Flanders' door]
       He's going to baptize _our_ children?
Homer: Oh, no!  In the eyes of God they'll be Flanderseseses.
-- Homer confuses possessives, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

% On the way to the baptism site, Ned reflects on recent events.

   Ned: Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents,
        but now I know you kids need a less hellbound family!
 Maude: Just sit back, and before you know it, you'll be part of the
        Flanders flock.
  Bart: Ha ha, you're going to be Lisa Flanders!
  Lisa: You're going to be _Bart_ Flanders.
  Bart: Aah!
 Maude: Oh, relax, Bart.  Your sister Maggie isn't scared.
  Bart: That's because she can't talk.
Maggie: [pulls her pacifier out] Daddily doodily!
         [she turns her head 180 degrees to face Bart and Lisa]
-- Maggie "Linda" Simpson, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

% Homer and Marge are in hot pursuit.

Marge: Where are we going?  Where are we going?
Homer: OK, OK, don't panic.  To find Flanders, I just have to think like
       Flanders!
        [thinking] I'm a big four-eyed lame-o, and I wear the same
       stupid sweater every day and --
        [aloud] The Springfield River!
-- "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

% At said river, the Flanders family sings the final couple of lines of
% "Amazing Grace".  Ned is dressed in priestly garb.

Ned: Today we write a new page in the Flanders Family Bible!
      [he leads the kids into the water]
     Who wants to be the first to enter God's good graces?
      [Bart and Lisa point to each other]
-- You first, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

% Rev. Lovejoy has a couple of movers helping him move his train track.
% As they reach the middle of the road, Homer's car slams through the
% board on which the tracks are mounted, destroying it.  Lovejoy
% implores heavenward, "Why do you hate my trains?"
%
% At the river, Ned prepares to anoint Bart with water from a golden
% chalice.  Homer and Marge arrive, Homer spots the "I (heart) your
% children" bumper sticker on Flanders' car, and he growls and runs down
% the hill to the river.  On the way, he trips, and bounces down the
% rest of the way, coming to rest with his face in the mud on the bank.
% He looks up just in time to see Ned tipping the chalice.  "No!" he
% cries in slow-motion, diving toward Bart to knock him out of the way.
% He reaches Bart just in time -- but the baptism water lands on Homer's
% head instead.  He writhes around in the river and growls, finally
% coming to rest face down.
%
% Bart and Lisa run up to him and hug him.

 Bart: Wow, Dad, you took a baptismal for me.  How do you feel?
Homer: [reverently] Oh, Bartholomew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo
       after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan.
  Ned: [gasps] Wait!  Homer, what did you just say?
Homer: I said shut your ugly face, Flanders!
  Ned: Oh, fair enough.
-- Ned, forgiving Christian, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

% Homer looks toward the bank and sighs, "Oh, there's my sweet little
% Maggie."  She looks to his outstretched arms, then over at the
% Flanders family, who stand clean and dry on the bank with a butterfly
% flying and rabbit hopping around them.  In the water, meanwhile,
% Homer, Bart, and Lisa look sodden, and a frog jumps out of the water.
% Maggie starts to walk toward the Flanders, but just then, Marge walks
% around the corner.  Maggie reaches for her mother, and Marge scoops
% her up and spins around with her in the sunlight.  "Oh, Maggie, you're
% a Simpson again."  As if in agreement, she pulls out her pacifier and
% burps.
%
% The Simpson family, reunited at last, hug and walk away.

Marge: So what was it like at the Flanders' house?
Homer: Yeah, gimme all the dirt.
 Lisa: Let's see.  Dirt....dirt...well, there wasn't really much dirt.
 Bart: There was a bunch of old paint cans in the garage, though.
Homer: [laughs scoffingly] Old painty-can Ned.
        [the family laugh too]
-- Humorous epithets, "Home Sweet Home-Diddily-Dum-Doodily"

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:14]
%
% Over the credits, Homer continues, "I always knew he'd keep his old
% cans of paint."  Marge asks, "How do you like that?"
