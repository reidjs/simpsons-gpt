[=========================[Season Sixteen Summary]==========================]

Story cut episodes: FABF22, FABF21, FABF16, GABF01, GABF06, GABF10, GABF15.
Compressed episodes: All but FABF16.
Expanded .1 seconds of an episode: GABF10.
Missing lines: FABF23, GABF01, GABF10.
Added content: FABF21 (opening), GABF10.
Changed content: FABF20, GABF14.

Total time cut: 2:52 (2 min 52 sec) (lengthened intro time not counted)
Story time cut: 2:52 (2 min 52 sec)
Total time gained: 10:31 (10 min 31 sec)

Notes: As with the past few seasons, the TV rating bug is nowhere to be seen;
       however, I did notice that the original ratings (e.g. TV-PG-DLV) of
       each episode are still accessible by V-chip, and have been for some
       time. (For this season, however, the production code in the XDS info
       appears to be gone.)

       This season's compression trend is a little different; now it usually
       begins right at the start of the first act, without waiting for the
       running credits to finish, and generally stops about a minute before
       any given act does (perhaps for cleaner compression ratios to achieve
       a desired length?). I have not included the ending points for every
       single act, but if you really want them, ask!

       $ There was a minor bit of Fox censorship on some original airings of
       $ this episode. Near the end, when Homer tells Marge that she'll
       $ always be the best chef in their house, she responds "Eh, BFD."
       $ If you know what it means, then good for you! Anyhow, the first Fox
       $ airing was silenced at this point, so it sounded like "bee... -ee."
       $ According to my notes, the second airing was intact, though the
       $ third was more like "bee eh- dee-" (why it was apparently cut off
       $ again near the end I'm not sure). Fortunately, the full line is
       $ present in the syndicated version.

       ! For season 16, an unusual approach was used to handle some credits.
       ! Since Homer and Lisa continue to talk through the main cast credits,
       ! but then the theme kicks in, the syndicated version does not cut to
       ! commercial until between Harry Shearer's and Marcia Wallace's names.
       ! (Times for the last act and the credits are based on this break.) Do
       ! note, though, that the music starts while Harry's name is still on-
       ! screen, so in syndication it's silent there and picks up abruptly

         Homer: Sweetie, that's orphan talk.

         some grunts,
       %              we go inside, where there is more hammering, as Homer

       ! Complicated cut warning!

           Pilot: We have started our descent and will soon be landing in
                  Beijing.
       % Copilot: [Chinese accent with pilot inflection] If you look out the
       %          left side of the aircraft, you will see our monument to (*)
       %          warrior and (**) spicy chicken pioneer General Gao.
       %
       % At (**) above, the image changes to a shot of a giant Chinese

       % Music starts as we see the plane, which has landed, on the runway,
       % rolling in.
                     In syndication, the scene starts as the "na" in "Air
         China" is visible.

       ! Oh, if only it were as simple as it might look. In syndication, the
       ! visual shot of the plane in the clouds stays for a few seconds, till
       ! the point (*) would be reached if the audio stayed the same. The
       ! audio switches at that point to the music, which would have been
       ! dropped otherwise. It's about a 3-second overlap, with a net visual
       ! (or audio) cut of 11 seconds.
       !
       ! Note too how silly this is. I guess it was important to establish
       ! where they were, but a properly timed straight cut should do. Also,
       ! in the original, there are plane sound effects behind the music in
       ! the landing scene, so in syndication, suddenly you can hear the
       ! plane even though the shot never changes! Finally, it's a weird cut,
       ! because the pilot's line makes the viewer expect something that
       ! never happens. Argh!

       ! Oh, you thought that was all? At the Gracie Films logo:

       ! Original: "Shh!" Music starts, "and we're done," says Hawking.

      +!     Synd: No "shh!" or music; "badabing, badaboom, and we're done."
       !
       ! I do not know why the start of Mr. Hawking's quote is missing in the
       ! original version. Interestingly, the quote starts at the same point
       ! in all three (on the third Gracie note), even where the usual Gracie
       ! sounds are not underlaid, so timing does not seem to be the
       ! explanation. I also can't explain the music drop.

       ! In conclusion, WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY? Was the exclusion of the special
       ! credits intentional, a mistake, a legal thing? And what of the
       ! botched Gracie sound? That could maybe be explained if the credits
       ! were put together in a rush. But will we see a fourth version on DVD
       ! or one of the incomplete ones above, or perhaps several alternates?
