=======================================================================

    On vacation at the beach, Lisa plays dumb to make friends with some
    "cool" kids, leaving an envious Bart all burned up, with Milhouse
    as his only comrade.
    [Last first-run episode of the season.]

=======================================================================
> Opening Sequence
=======================================================================

>> COUCH SCENE

     A ringing sound is heard as the couch spits up a picture of
     OFF in sitting position like a FAX machine, which then slides
     under the couch.

       (Recycled from 2F17.)

[Okay, we rode out the season -- 7 blackboards out of 25 episodes?!
 What is the friggin' problem???  --ed]

=======================================================================
> Did you notice...
=======================================================================
   ... Milhouse swims with his glasses on?

Ricardo A. Lafaurie Jr.:
   ... the first time they've shown two new episodes in the same day.
   ... in the couch scene, the fax paper slides under the couch this
       time, unlike in 3F12?
   ... school starts at 9:00 and ends at 3:00?
   ... when the bell first starts to ring at the end of Hoover's
       lesson it sounds like a gun cocking?
   ... Samantha Stanky was in the circle of girls that Lisa tried to
       get to sign her yearbook?
   ... Becky is the former "girl with the ultra-skinny legs"?  (The
       one who plays hopscotch in 7F09.)  (They've thickened her
       legs too.)
   ... when Lisa says "Like, you know, whatever" she sounds like
       Gail Matthius?
   ... Marge is right... Bart _hasn't_ said "Don't have a cow" in
       four years?
   ... a shell covers the rear view mirror?

Haynes Lee:
   ... Marge also hates the Flanders?
   ... a scrod is a young cod or haddock, esp. as food.
   ... Homer ordering embarrassing stuff such as porno magazines, large
       box of condoms, panty shields, bottle of liquor, and two enema
       kits?
   ... Marge's hair scraping the top of the bumper car arena?

Lawrence Lam:
   ... Springfield uses septic tanks?
   ... Newsweek did an article on Springfield?

Dale Abersold:
   ... Lisa is aware of Gore Vidal's, uh, proclivities?
   ... once again, Milhouse appears to be insane (in Act 1)?
   ... Marge's irritation with Ned's notily-dotilies?
   ... "slacker" Lisa is adorable?
   ... Marge's quick 180-degree turn with the Rice Krispie treats and
       Tang?

Don Del Grande:
   ... the yearbooks have "leatheroleum" covers?
   ... Miss Hoover's clock does not have a second hand, but Mrs.
       Krabappel's does?
   ... there's a bell in Miss Hoover's room?
   ... neither Janey nor Allison signed Lisa's yearbook?
   ... Lisa's in the Camera Club now, but she wasn't in 7G10 when Bart
       had his photos developed?
   ... Marge did a very dangerous thing by holding Maggie in her lap
       the entire way to the beach?
   ... this is the first time Lisa has worn sandals?
   ... the kids Lisa meets appear to be older than she is, yet she has
       no problem fitting in with them?
   ... Lisa calls Bart her "little brother"?
   ... Homer buys an M-320, which presumably is 4 times as powerful as
       an M-80?
   ... Bart says "This is the worst Fourth of July ever!", just as Lisa
       said "This is the worst Christmas ever!" in 3F07?
   ... Lisa didn't pack her yearbook, yet Bart had it at the beach?

John Murray:
   ... Springfield is America's crud basket?
   ... none of the bedrooms are filled with Ned's helpful notes?
   ... Lisa will control the birds someday?
   ... Bart usually has matches and/or a lighter?
   ... Marge washing the cracked & black dishes from the dishwasher?

Adam Monteiro:
   ... Lisa was a member of the Junior Overachievement?
   ... Celeste at the water fountain in school?
   ... aside from the opening of the show, this is the first time the
       wheels of the car are animated to show the car turning out of
       the driveway?
   ... Homer's porn at the cabin is entitled "American Breast
       Enthusiasts?"
   ... Milhouse recoils from Bart's spit 2 frames before it hits him?
   ... a black haired version of our favorite bookworm and brainiac
       Martin Prince is visible on the Whirly-Gig at the carnival,
       wearing a pink shirt and dark blue pants?
   ... Little Jimmy from the "Meat Council" film in 3F03 is seated on
       the whirly-gig to Bart's immediate right?
   ... there is an empty seat on the Whirly-Gig?
   ... Homer wasn't drinking "Duff", he was drinking "Buzz Cola?"
		   
Veronica Marquez:                   
   ... Mr. Estes is dead?
   ... Sherri and Terri sign each other's yearbooks?
   ... Marge seems to be homophobic?
   ... the beachhouse's number is 916?

       makes?

   ... the Valu-Mart clerk looks like Apu, but with a beard and turban?
   ... the male kids Lisa hangs out with are named Ben, Dean, and
       Rick?  (They don't specify who's who.)
   ... Erin signs her name with a heart balloon emerging from the "N"?

Jose Lafaurie:
   ... Bart has an "old-school" skateboard, and his tricks are either
       impossible or pathetic?

Jason Hancock:
   ... Lisa cuts a yearbook cover as she opens the box?
   ... Milhouse is in a child safety seat, but Maggie isn't?
   ... Homer wears his seat belt in this episode, unlike 3F21?
   ... the "P.C. Donuts" display at the Lil' Valu-Mart?
   ... Uter in the picture of the German Table?
   ... when Lisa squirts the honey bear, _no_ honey comes out at all?
   ... one of the water-balloon clowns almost looks like Krusty?

Tom Baker:
   ... the caption below Lisa's picture states she is "sister of
       school's most popular student"?
   ... that, as editor of the yearbook, she either wrote that herself
       or approved it after someone else wrote it?
   ... Marge was savvy enough to -not- bother the kids with Rice Krispie
       squares and Tang when Erin said her mother did that?
   ... that Erin's forehead is as big as Christina Ricci's?  (She has a
       high hairline.)
   ... the fireworks "Yang Tze Doodle" and "Play More with Claymore"?

John Westergaard:
   ... the yearbooks were bound (at extra cost) in "Leatheroleum"?

Mark Richey:
   ... Sherri & Terri sign each others books?

   ... the fist skeleton in the sludge?
   ... Marge mopping up the mess in the kitchen?
   ... the honey bear?
   ... Homer throws a Buzz Cola can out the window?

   ... the anchor hanging on the wall in Ned's bedroom?
   ... the handicapped parking space outside L'il Valu-Mart?
   ... Flander's coffee table is a sheet of glass atop a lobster trap?

Three shots: 1) Right-hand page, then

		stay there to let you glance at it.
	     3) Quick glance at corner for Milhouse's signature.

Stylized signatures:

   Erin always drags the tail of the "n" up and makes it a heart.
   (awwwww) (typical pre-teenage girl signature)

  Dean always underlines quickly three times in a rightleftright
     motion.  It winds up looking like a squashed "Zorro" mark.

  (Rick, Ben and Milhouse didn't do anything special in their
   names.)

Little pictures:

  Erin added a sun peeping out from behind clouds in the upper
     leftt corner.  She added a scallop shell (like the "Shell"
     oil logo) in the upper right (with the hinge pointing to the
     corner).

  Dean added, to the left of his note, a "falling" star flying
     down with a short trail behind it (like a rainbow).

  Rick added, to the right of his note, a stylized          :
     skateboard.  (Pardon bad ascii art.)                  /o

  Ben added, to the left, in lower corner, a drawing of the

> Animation, Continuity, and other Goofs
=======================================================================

* According to the lineup chart in "Who Shot Mr. Burns, Part II
  (2F20)," Bart is 3 feet tall, and Lisa is a couple of inches shorter.
  If the title refers to Lisa, it's an exaggeration.  {bjr}

* When Lisa pulled out a yearbook, it was slashed diagonally, yet if
  the books were packed properly, the slash should have been
  horizontal.  {ddg}

* The girls in the yearbook office sure seemed to be Lisa's friends.
  {mar}

+ Allison is seen in the huddled crowd of kids waiting for their
  yearbooks -- and she doesn't even seem to notice Lisa!  {vm}

* Bart doesn't do personalized signings, yet he personalizes Skinner's.
  {mar}

+ Lisa has Janey and Allison as her friends; also, she has more friends
  in 8F08.

+ Lisa claims to have perfect attendance, yet in 3F21 she missed a day
  to attend Hullabalooza (not to mention her mumps back in 7F14,
  although that's when her teacher was "Mrs." Hoover)  {ddg}

* The Simpsons' house has its own septic tank, a truly ancient relic.
  (See below).  {jw}

= When Homer is loading the car, the tailgate is open, but in the next
  shot, it is shut.  {am2}

= When Marge is making the beds, the initial shot shows pictures of
  Maude and Ned hanging on the wall.  In later shots, a picture of Todd
  and Rod replaces Maude's portrait.  {bjr}

= Right after Lisa meets the other kids, her glasses disappear.  {mar}

+ Lisa has skateboarded, and skateboarded well, in MG21.

* It's impossible to skateboard through water using its tail.  {am}

= Bart didn't have his slingshot at the beginning of his skateboard
  ride.  {mar}

- Hermit crabs have long, fleshy abdomens.  {dh2}

* Didn't the door in Mystery Date lie flat on the board?  And you had
  to spin it?  Was there more than one version?  {tb}

* How did Bart get Lisa's yearbook?  {dga}

- In the scene after Bart reveals the truth to Lisa's friends, Marge's
  pearls are white.

- Milhouse's legs aren't under the table at the beginning of the
  morning-after breakfast season.  {mar}

- When Lisa tips the honey bottle over, the honey stops at a diagonal,
  but when she tips it back, it immediately reverts to its original
  position.  {ddg}

* The copyright page on the credits is missing the (c) symbol.  {vm}

=======================================================================
> Comments and other observations
=======================================================================

>> Outtakes

Tom Baker says, "About the ad scene which never was in the episode:
    The store ownere says: `This is the neutron cherry bomb!  It
    destroys heads but leaves smiles intact!'  A reference to the
    neutron bomb, which kills people but leaves buildings intact."

>> Revisionist History

Don Del Grande says, "Revisionist history!  There are some differences
    between this episode and 8F24, the first `last day of school' 
    episode:

    - In 8F24, Miss Hoover hands out the report cards and then "quietly
      runs out the clock"; in 3F22, she reads about Lincoln's
      assasination
    - In 8F24, Miss Hoover gave Lisa a B+ in Conduct; in 3F22, Lisa
      says she has "straight A's"
    - In 8F24, everybody leaves when the bell rings; in 3F22, a number
      of students stay to receive their yearbooks and have them signed
    - In 8F24, Bart and Lisa are at Kamp Krusty on July 4 while Homer,
      Marge, and Maggie are having a picnic; here, they're at the
      beach"

>> "Do I sound like that Bart Simpson character on TV?"

Don Del Grande makes a very pointed observation.  "Possible self-
    reference, although it's a stretch: when Lisa says `Don't have a
    cow, man!' and `Ay caramba!', the first thing I thought of was
    that Yeardley Smith originally auditioned for Bart (and Nancy
    Cartwright was there to audition for Lisa), but was told that she
    sounded `too much like a girl'."

>> It's what all the toons are wearing this year

Benjamin J. Robinson notes, "Lisa certainly looked cute in her
    beachcomber togs, but don't look to see her again in that outfit
    anytime soon.  According to `TV Guide,' animators prefer that the
    characters stick to solid-color clothing.  With patterned clothing,
    the artists have to meticulously make sure they draw the pattern
    in the same place frame after frame.  If they didn't, the pattern
    would seem to float around on the outfit.  Lisa's shirt had no
    fewer than three colors, and Lisa got an awful lot of screen time
    (in other words, more drawings) in this episode, too.  About the
    only saving grace, from an animator's standpoint, is that the
    pattern was irregular enough to provide some cover for mistakes.
    Well, at least Lisa didn't pick a paisley shirt!"

>> Ricci is Rich-i

Christina Ricci is a teenage actress, known for, among other things,
    her turned-up nose.  (At least for me.)  Her first movie was with
    Cher and Winona Ryder (Lisa's other friend in 1F17) and was called
    "Mermaids".  Her more famous roles are "The Addams Family" movies
    (Wednesday) and "Casper" (Kat).  Her other and more minor movies
    include "Now and Then", and "Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear
    Mountain".  IMHO she did an outstanding job in voicework in this
    episode; I didn't even know it was her at first!

>> Play More with Claymore

Tom Baker says "Claymore" "is a type of weapon. It's not really a bomb.
    Instead it's a directional charge suitable mostly for killing a lot
    of ambushed people.  You set it up to face a certain direction,
    then take the controls to a nearby hiding place. When you've got
    people in front of the claymore, you set it off. The blast goes off
    in the direction you faced it, and kills as many as possible.  It's
    really not suitable for blowing up things, just people. ... I
    thought the phrase `Play More with Claymore' was sufficiently absurd
    to be funny."

>> Septic Tank?  Surely you jest...

John Westergaard says of the Simpserosa, "Their house has a septic
    tank.  I'm a civil engineer, and I can say with some certainty that
    houses that are that close together would be attached to a sewer
    system (even the ancient Greeks had those), especially since all
    the houses in the neighborhood seem to have basements.  It DID
    provide yet another field of expertise for Ned Flanders, though.
    Is there anything this guy CAN'T do?"

>> Miscellaneous References

"Blossom"... a TV show that recently ended and held a high audience.
    The main character was Blossom Russo (played by Mayim Bialik) who
    always had a weird dress on.  Also starring Jenna Von Oy, the
    fastest talker on prime time today, and Joey Lawrence, Mr. Teen
    Flash-in-the-Pan-Heartthrob (groan).  IMHO, the show was OK but
    had the annoying tendency to go into these "sentimentality-and-or-
    uncomfortable-humorless-moments" mode.

"Baywatch"... Mark Richey: "is an insanely popular drama starring
    Pamela Anderson Lee and David Hasselhoff about people in bikinis
    running in slow motion for an hour.  OK, so there is a plot
    (lifeguards on a LA beach who have to save the lives of a bunch of
    kids and old people in really melodramatic storylines), but does
    ANYONE watch it for that?"  It's the Devil's Show.  PEOPLE called
    it the show "that launched a thousand diets".  And if anyone
    reading this thinks Pamela Anderson Lee is beautiful, they can eat
    quiche, because they are disgusting. 

Bastille Day... Bastille Day, July 14, commemorates the fall of the
    Bastille in 1789.  This event started the French Revolution which
    overthrew the old French monarchy and feudal system.

Aaron Varhola notes, "An M-80 is a firecracker equivalent to a quarter-
    stick of dynamite.  We can assume an M-320 is a full stick of
    dynamite."  In the Where is Springfield side, Aaron Varhola notes,
    "We can also assume OFF didn't go through Ohio or South Carolina,
    the fireworks capitals of America, on their trip. :)

Aaron Varhola ponders, "Lisa, Queen of Birds? Sounds like an REM song."

Tom Baker notes that "the long name, `Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport',
    is not that very out of place in the beach resorts of Maine (and
    perhaps other parts of the country).  Maine has places like
    `Damariscotta' and `Kennebunkport', and Native American names can
    get very long."

> Reviews
=======================================================================

Dale Abersold - A Lisa episode should show her progressing into
    depression, but end up hopeful.  This fulfilled those requirements
    beautifully.  Only the cornball ending kept this episode from
    perfection.  While it didn't get the publicity [3F21] did, this
    episode was deservedly the season finale.  Grade: A.

Tom Baker - Lots of jokes and Christina Ricci, too. A solid plot that
    I cared about; it made a difference that Bart, who was more hateful
    than Homer's ever been, was shown up, and that Lisa did get what
    she was after. Basic plot (Lisa finds some popularity, Bart gets
    jealous) supplemented by -very- good Homer antics and Marge
    eccentricities.  The downsides are two: One is the very same happy
    ending I mentioned [...] The other is this is because this was a
    theme "out of character".  My rating: A

Shawn Berry - Now, THIS one was *funny*!!! Much, much funnier than the
    Homerpalooza one. I give this episode an A. It was well written and
    I wrote down just about every gag that came along, which was pretty
    frequently.  More laughs per minute in this one than the one a
    half-hour ago.

Frederic Briere - As feared, Lisa was well out of character in some
    scenes, mostly in the first half. However, the true Simpsons humor
    we've been lacking of lately really shone in that episode, along
    with subtle meta-humor ("Don't have a cow, man!") which made me
    smile brightly. This is truly a golden episode, which only Lisa's
    behavior and a predictably moralistic ending (just be yourself and
    happiness will follow) prevented from reaching the status of
    excellence attained by its cousin, Lisa's Wedding.  GRADE: A-

Chris Courtois - "Summer of 4 Ft. 2" was the closest thing to a
    "classic" Simpsons episode that Season 7 had to offer. Once I
    overcame the initial continuity problem needed to set up the plot
    (Lisa has *no* friends? What happened to Janey (seen carpooling
    half-an-hour earlier) or Allison?), it was quite good. Good
    believable, yet funny, storyline; great goofy (not obnoxious) Homer
    sub-plot; quick (as opposed to dwelled on) meta-humor ("You haven't
    said [Don't have a cow] in over 4 years"); and all the family
    members acting as the real characters we came to love years ago,
    not just as gag foils. Even the predictable ending, which could
    have been unbearably sappy, was handled well. This season, they
    saved the best for last. An A.

Don Del Grande - B - somehow it seemed like a "plot clip show"; Lisa
    trying to become popular, Bart getting jealous and then breaking it
    up, Bart going out of his way to help Lisa...but I did like the
    "new look Lisa"

Jeff Gustafson - This is what the show is supposed to be like.  There
    were a great deal of funny gags, and it was rather touching.  By
    the way, when did Bart last say "Don't have a cow?" Grade: A+

Dominik Halas - A fitting end to the season.  Although it seemed as if
    this episode could get overly sentimental at times, this was always
    prevented (for example, Homer's shock at seeing his car covered in
    shells nicely saved that scene.)  The portrayal of Lisa was
    generally in character, and there were quite a few funny moments.
    Grade:  B.

Jason Hancock - Now _this_ was an _excellent_ episode, especially
    having followed the disappointing "Homerpalooza," and I'm glad this
    season of peaks and valleys has ended on a high note.  Milhouse's
    "Up yours, Krabappel!" and Homer's improvised swimsuit scene stood
    out as far as laughs go, but Lisa being in a situation that I know
    all too well put this one over the top.  Only "Mother Simpson" was
    better this year.  Grade:  A+.

Lawrence Lam - Homer's funniest joke was putting the sticker on
    himself. Can the Flandereses get any more stupid? I thought that
    Lisa would totally change for the next season but maybe she will be
    more self-confident or more depressed next season.  Marge pointed
    out that Bart hasn't said "Don't have a cow" for four years.
    Another okay episode. Better than the last one. B+

Norman J. Landis - "Summer of 4 foot 2" was classic Simpsons, with a
    return to really bad family values:)  It moved along at a nice
    leisurely pace, and every once in a while I had to sit up and take
    notice.  [...] My grade: A

Haynes Lee - I thought this episode couldn't top Homerpalooza but it
    did. One of the best episodes since "Lisa's Wedding".  GRADE: A+

Veronica Marquez - A good concept marred down by the fact that Lisa
    does have friends.  It looks like I'm alone on this, but I liked
    "Homerpalooza" better.  B-.

John Murray - We leave this season with a good taste in our mouths,
    thanks to this great episode.  This episode has a lot of classic
    Simpsons traits, mainly unexpected ROFLOL lines.  Also a good A
    plot that didn't continually try to show an obvious message, and
    also the main plot got broken up by a few small episodes that kept
    the main plot fresh.  Grade: A

Ryan Pederson - The show after the season finale was pretty good.
    [contradiction in terms --ed] I especially liked it when they were
    playing the dream date game and Homer gets the school hunk and then
    tells Marge not to wait up.  I couldn't stop laughing.  The show
    did start off slow and ran a little slow throughout.  [...] B+

Jeff Reis - Wow...back to back hits! I've been as harsh a critic as any
    this season, but this was a rock-solid episode. This one got nearly
    everything right; plenty of great comedy and a classic "sweet
    Simpsons" undercurrent that was neither sappy nor forced. Lisa
    cracking everyone up with Bart's catch phrases was riotously funny,
    as was Homer's shopping trip. And Lisa's new-found friends were
    nicely done. [...] The lame moments were very rare (what's up with
    Marge lately...something's just a little off) [...] This one's an
    A minus.

Mark Richey - A decent, if unremarkable, episode to end a decent, if
    unremarkable, season.  It's nice to see an episode finally taking
    place during the summer (and for all those concerned, Bart will be
    back in Mrs. Krabappel's class next year).  However, haven't the
    writers squeezed every drop from the "Lisa the friendless nerd"
    thread?  I liked this episode, but Lisa DOES have friends and ISN'T
    a total nerd.  Lets not have any more episodes that try to convince
    me otherwise.  A-

Benjamin J. Robinson - It's hard to watch this episode and not come
    away with the feeling that it could have been better.  A good
    concept -- Lisa recasts herself to fit in with the hip crowd --
    is weighed down by her off-target characterization and a too-
    formulaic ending.  That's curious, since Dan Greaney did better
    work in "King Size Homer (3F05)."  It's not so much that the script
    was bad, as it was that it wasn't quite true to "The Simpsons."
    Amusing enough to score a B-, but just barely.

Terrance Scanlan - Of course what good is a season finale with a
    dramatic finale: (a.k.a. Blood Fued, Secrets to a Successful
    Marraige, Who shot Mr. Burns). Lisa's first crack at friends and
    took seven seasons to even find out if she had any friends. Of
    course what really took the laughter advantage was Homer's Giant
    Firework Display, which would probably be his dream (to burn down
    _one of_ Flanders' house)  Grade: **.5,  C, 7.5/10

Devin Tuffy - Most of this was great; really good plot, and tons of
    stuff that had me ROTFL.  However, the total 180-degree turn by
    Lisa's new friends at the end was a bit unsettling; much like "Lisa
    the Vegetarian" in which an otherwise perfect show was marred by a
    hurried cop-out ending.  Still, a great episode overall.  A

Aaron Varhola - What else can I say? An excellent episode; Lisa was
    well within character in her going out of character, then back in.
    The episode was touching without being maudlin, and had many
    hilarious lines. It's interesting to note that Lisa was
    appreciated more by older children.  A++/A+; one of the 8 or so
    best episodes ever. Frosty Chocolate Milkshake Awards (tm) to
    Yeardley Smith and Dan Greaney.  BTW, I can't wait for cels of this
    episode to come out. Lisa looks so cool in her beach outfit. Z:)

John Westergaard - They might as well have advertized it as "A very
    special ... Simpsons."  But it worked.  A- from me, but WHY oh WHY
    does EVERY episode centering around Lisa have to have an obligatory
    scene ending with her running off crying?

Yours Truly - There might be a few people who say that Lisa was out of
    character, but I believe that she should not be expected to act
    like an eight-year-old adult.  Even adults need friends, and Lisa's
    dilemma was played out nicely.  (I also have a personal bias... I
    didn't go to the senior prom, and look at me -- I'm a Simpsons
    nerd!)  Nice work by Christina Ricci as Erin, too.  A+.

AVERAGE GRADE: B+/A- (3.67)
