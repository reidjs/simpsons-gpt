=======================================================================

    Bart wants justice done after learning that the animator (voice of

    Lionel Hutz takes the case.  Suzanne Somers has a cameo.

   ... John Swartzwelder is dressed like Barney?

       but not as the "I Didn't Do It" kid?
   ... "Manhattan Madness" was done by Lampwick Studios?
   ... when the cartoon finished, the film only appears to be halfway
       completed in the projector?
   ... when Bart calls Chester "the father of cartoon violence",
       Snowball II runs off in a cloud of dust?
   ... somebody did their homework, as Lisa's plate at dinner appears
       to be the only one without meat (depending on what Maggie was
       eating)?
   ... Lisa doesn't wear her bicycle helmet?
   ... the God Mouse has four fingers per hand?

John Murray:
   ... the ghost of Scratchy froze in the freezer, with no liquid?

Matthew Kurth:

= In the first shot of Itchy's table, there wasn't a knife on it.
  {mar}

* The street behind Kent Brockman should not have been visible as it
  was on television at 11:00 at night.  {ddg}

= During the night before the parade, the sidewalk in front of the
  chais grew.  {ddg}

= The piano Chester plays was in the back of the room in the first
  shot, but in the front in the second shot.  {mar}

* The print of the early Itchy cartoon that burned on the projector
  is cellulose nitrate stock, which degrades rapidly with time.
  It's unlikely that a print as old as this would survive at all, much
  less being carried around outdoors by a bum.  {pk}

* A copyright case would be heard in a federal court, not the local
  Springfield town court.  {pk}

* Copyrights do expire.  The rules have changed several times this
  century, but it's possible that the original copyright on Itchy and
  Scratchy have expired by now, and, depending on the statue of
  limitations, I&S Enterprises would not have to pay ongoing royalties
  to use the characters.  {pk}

* If Itchy & Scratchy is celebrating their 75th anniversary (and if
  Itchy & Scratchy Enterprises was established in 1921), explain how
  `Steamboat Itchy' was created and copyrighted in 1928.

+ In 2F01, Bart said Disgruntled Goat was created in the 1980's as
  part of the Itchy & Scratchy Friends Hour.  Here he is presented as
  one of Roger Myers Sr's original creations.  {mar}

+ How did Homer get $750 for the drawing Bart wants?  {jh}

* Why didn't Krusty have any I&S cartoons?  They had 75 years worth of
  backlogs to draw on, and Channel 6 could surely pay the royalties.
  {mar}

+ What about Marge's stand against cartoon violence in Season Two's
  "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge" (7F09)?  Why would she call I&S "cute
  little cartoon friends" now?  {mk}

+ Since when was Krusty married?  {jh}

=======================================================================
> Comments and other observations
=======================================================================

>> Guest Voices in this episode (aka Who is Jack Sheldon?)

Kirk Douglas is an acclaimed actor of the screen, who made films
    throughout the '50s, '60s, and early '70s.  He was `Spartacus'
    (I love you Spartacus!)  The most recent role I've seen him in is
    the TV movie "Queenie", starring Mia Sara, as her producer,
    director, and lover (*shudder*).  Oh yeah, and he's Michael
    Douglas' father.

Phil Hartman is a regular guest voice.  Somehow ads for this episode
    felt the need to hype him, since he's making quite a career for
    himself in commercials for McDonalds and Cheetos and in cheesy
    films such as "Houseguest" and "Sgt. Bilko".

Alex Rocco "is your regular grumpy old man next door type of actor.
    He did `The George Carlin Show', for which Sam Simon produced.
    Rocco also voiced Roger Myers in `Itchy & Scratchy & Marge'."
    {vm}

Jack Sheldon "did the voice of the Amendment.  He also played the Bill
    in the parodied Schoolhouse Rock cartoon and was somewhat of a
    singer." {vm}  He also starred in a number of failed sitcoms during
    the '70s.

Suzanne Somers was, um, the blonde one in "Three's Company" and acted
    in the failed sitcom "Step by Step".  She's made famous today for
    her work in pitching Thighmaster and Buttmaster.  (That's an
    embarassing name to see in a department store!)  She did good work
    in "Serial Mom" when Kathleen Turner told her off.  Maybe she's
    trying to get rid of her bimbo image by self-depreciating herself.

>> Mmmm... blintze.

Haynes Lee says a blintze is a Yiddish dish, a cheese-filled pancake
    served with jam.  (Yuk.)  Jason Hancock researches, "According
    to the Houghton Mifflin College Dictionary, a blintz is `a thin
    rolled pancake usually stuffed with cottage cheese and often
    served with sour cream.'  [Still yuk --ed]  It came from the
    Yiddish word for `pancake'."

>> The Reluctant Founding Fathers of Itchy

Benjamin Robinson says, "Working with Myers on `Steamboat Itchy' were
    two people destined to be famous.  George Gershwin was a noted
    American composer.  Joseph P. Kennedy was the father of _those_
    Kennedys -- John, Robert, and Ted.  Surprisingly, neither man
    mentioned their early work with `Steamboat Itchy'.  I guess they
    thought it was beneath their dignity."

>> The Fastest Thing on Wheels

Chester Lampwick keeps a rocket car that looks remarkably like the Blue
    Flame in his driveway (unprotected too!)  Benjamin Robinson gives
    us more information on this, er, car: "In 1970, Gary Gabelich
    drove the Blue Flame into the record books.  (Driving may not be
    the right word.  Gabelich was strapped into what amounted to a
    sub-orbital missile on wheels.)  Officials at the Bonneville Salt
    Flats clocked him at 622.407 miles per hour -- good enough for the
    world land speed record.  The Blue Flame was powered, and
    sponsored, by natural gas, which burns with -- you guessed it --
    blue flame.  The record stood until 1983, when the Thrust II
    managed in excess of 634 miles per hour."

>> Ted Kennedy Gay? Surely you jest.

Matthew Kurth says, "You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who will
    believe that Ted Kennedy is gay, as he has the reputation of being
    one of the biggest womanizers in the Senate."

>> Lester and Eliza: What the Hell is Going On?

Quoting a note written by law59@unlclass1.unl.edu on alt.tv.simpsons:

    "Lester and Eliza are obviously analogous to the major point of the
    episode that many cartoon concepts, or concepts in fiction, for
    that matter, are really rehashes of past characters.  It was very
    interesting the way Lester and Eliza were the original Bart and
    Lisa concepts (drawn the way they were originally on the Tracey
    Ullman show)."

>> Roger's Tirade

Mark Richey noticed that all of the characters and shows Roger Myers,
    Jr. mentioned are from Hanna-Barbera, who created Tom and Jerry,
    who Itchy and Scratchy is a parody of.

>> Wiggum the Cartoon Character

Mark Richey rambles, "Does this mean that everyone in the show realizes
    that they are cartoon characters?  Or does this mean... I have a
    headache now."

>> Lyrics for "Amendment-to-Be" (with Jack Sheldon, Pamela Hayden, and
   Harry Shearer)

	     Boy: [spoken] Hey, who left all this garbage lying on the
		  steps of Congress?
       Amendment: [spoken] I'm not garbage.

		  I'm an amendment to be
		  Yes, an amendment to be
		  And I'm hoping that they'll ratify me
		  There's a lot of flag burners
		  Who have got too much freedom
		  I wanna make it legal
		  For policemen
		  To beat 'em
		  'Cause there's limits to our liberties
		  'Least I hope and pray that there are
		  'Cause those liberal freaks go too far.

	     Boy: [spoken] But why can't we just make a law against
		  flag burning?
       Amendment: [spoken] Because that law would be unconstitutional.
		  But if we _changed_ the Constitution...
	     Boy: [spoken] Then we could make all sorts of crazy laws!
       Amendment: [spoken] Now you're catching on!

	 brief intermission as Bart and Lisa share comments

	     Boy: [spoken] But what if they say you're not good enough
		  to be in the Constitution?
       Amendment: Then I'll destroy all opposition to me
		  And I'll make Ted Kennedy pay
		  If he fights back
		  I'll say that he's gay
     Big Fat Guy: [running up] Good news, Amendment!  They ratified
		  'ya.   You're in the U.S. Constitution!
       Amendment: Oh, yeah!  Door's open, boys!
		   [many bills and amendments run in, guns a-shooting
		  and bombs a-flying]

>> Your Guide to Itchy and Scratchy, ep. 3F16 {fb}

[WARNING: If you haven't seen the episode, I strongly suggest you do not
 read what follows.  --ed]

   "Remembrance of Things Slashed"

      Itchy is moaning in sadness while reading about the death of
      Scratchy in the newspaper. [apparently since he didn't get to do
      it --ed] When the ghost of Scratchy appears before him, he tries
      to stab him with a knife, but to no avail. For once, it is
      Scratchy who is laughing, but Itchy has an idea. He sucks his
      beloved foe in the vacuum cleaner, and blows him into the
      freezer. After waiting for a moment, he stabs the frozen block in
      which Scratchy has turned into with an ice pick, dislodging the
      eyeballs which he uses as ice cubes for his drink. As Itchy
      drinks from it, Scratchy's eyes blink.

   "Itchy and Scratchy Meet Fritz the Cat"

      Scratchy is walking in some sort of "Bumtown", where he runs
      across a female chicken, obviously practicing the oldest job of
      all. "Hey, sister. Just give me a chance to get next to you." he
      declares, just before he sees Itchy driving by. After getting out
      of the car, Itchy grabs it and pours the gasoline on Scratchy,
      then takes a puff of his cigarette and throws it on him. Leaving
      Scratchy burning in flames, he drives away with Mrs. Chicken.
      "Hey, my threads, baby!" Scratchy wails.

   "Scratchy the Heretic"*

     A la Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, Itchy, carrying a large drill
     chases Scratchy (in rocket ACME shoes) across a desert landscape.
     Losing Scratchy, Itchy stops at a church and prays in Latin.
     Scratchy is smashed by a giant foot and thrown in the depths of
     hell.  Up above, Itchy and a God-mouse shake hands, and wink at
     the camera.  They then wink at the viewer.

>> Cartoon Biz References (or, Iwerks the Iconoclast)

"Fritz the Cat"... Mark Richey: "`Fritz the Cat' was created by
    underground cartoonist Robert Crumb.  It was turned into the first
    X-rated animated feature by Ralph Bakshi in 1972.  [Some may
    remember him also as the director of pervert-fantasy "Cool World"
    --ed]  According to the excellent documentary `Crumb', Crumb hated
    the movie version."

Damian Penny ponders, "I think the actual creator of I&S was based
    somewhat on the creators of `Superman', Jerry Siegel and Joe
    Shuster.  After they created the charcter, they sold the rights to
    DC for a piddling sum and later hit the skids.  They lost a court
    battle to regain control, but when the "Superman" movie was made in
    1978 attention was drawn to their plight, and DC started paying
    them royalties."

"Itchy the Lucky Mouse"... Matthew Kurth says this is a reference to 
    "`Oswald the Lucky Rabbit', created by Ub Iwerks, who was
    responsible for inspiring Walt Disney to pursue work in animation.
    Ub also worked with such influential people as Tex Avery, Walter
    Lantz, and Isadore (Friz) Freleng.

Matthew Kurth says, "Note the use of the `Manhattan Madness' and
    Lampwick Studios logo on every card.  This was pioneered by
    American Biograph just after the turn of the century as a technique
    to discourage other studios from `borrowing' portions of their
    films, or worse, taking their films and releasing them in their
    entirety under their name."

From Matthew Kurth (again!): "Chester J. Lampwick's assertion that
    Roger Meyers Sr. was a poor artist is a tie-in reference to Felix
    the Cat.  Felix was created by Otto Messmer, and marketed by Pat
    Sullivan.  Sullivan took all the credit for the work, though
    Messmer did most of the early work entirely by himself on his
    behalf.  This is bolstered by Lampwick's written message to Meyers
    describing him as being more ambitious than talented, because
    although Sullivan himself was an aspiring animator, his work was
    never above mediocrity.  Furthermore, Sullivan died well before
    Messmer just as Meyers did before Lampwick, and both Messmer and
    Lampwick survived in almost complete obsurity for decades following
    the deaths of Sullivan and Meyers.  The scenerio is also, however,
    another reference to `Steamboat Willie'.  Ub Iwerks did most of the
    work on the cartoon himself, because the other employees working
    for Disney at the time thought that Mickey's hijinks were too
    violent.  Go figure." (Whoa :)

"Schoolhouse Rock"... Jason Hancock provides us with information on
    this show: "a series of Saturday morning 3-minute cartoons seen on
    ABC in the 1970s and early '80s.  They were usually seen during
    long commercial breaks and were intended to teach children using
    some pretty memorable songs, like `I'm Just a Bill' (the sketch
    in which Krusty's `Amendment' cartoon is based on).  There were
    four different subjects: `Grammar Rock', `Science Rock', `America
    Rock', and (my personal favorite) `Multiplication Rock'.  (Yes,
    folks, THAT was how I learned my times tables!  I remember seeing
    them in the spring and summer of 1984, just before I entered
    third grade.)  Ah, memories..."  Veronica Marquez also notes that
    Jack Sheldon voiced as the bill in "Just a Bill", and played the
    Amendment here.  (Not the first time OFF has recruited the original
    actor to parody himself; recall Colonel Klink in 1F07)

Benjamin Robinson stated it first, but Matthew Kurth expounds: "Roger
    Meyers Sr.'s head being cryogenically frozen is a ref to the long-
    standing urban legend that Walt Disney was cryogenically frozen
    upon his death."  This legend has been made fun of many a time,
    including on the late ToonMUSH II.

Lester and Eliza... they were drawn like the sketchy, very early
    versions of Bart and Lisa on "The Tracey Ullman Show".  Note that
    Eliza has space around the pearls, the dress is a darker shade of
    red, and not strapless.  Veronica Marquez says: "I think the
    writers were trying to poke fun at the people who dislike detective
    episodes by making someone else solve them, and that someone else
    to still be, in a way, Bart and Lisa."  Matthew Kurth (again with
    the Kurth) notes: "If you carry that a bit, it is also a weak
    reference to an episode of `The Chipmunks' in which the 1990s
    Alvin, Simon, and Theodore meet their 1960s counterparts."  (You
    _watched_ that show?  Just kidding...)

Matthew Kurth (cartoon wiz, evidently) notes there is a relevance in
    the years used in this episode:

      1919 - Felix the Cat premieres in "Feline Follies", possibly on
	     Sept. 3
      1921 - Walt Disney begins animating early forms of what would
	     become known as the "Neuman Laugh-O-Grams"; Pat Sullivan
	     lands a deal to produce "Felix the Cat" cartoons on a
	     regular basis.
      1928 - Mickey Mouse premieres in "Steamboat Willie"

> Reviews
=======================================================================

Richard Cole - I don't know what I missed, but I didn't think last
    night's episode was particularly good.  I thought the story was
    weak.  What the hell was the purpose of Lester and Eliza --
    couldn't the writers come up with a way for Bart and Lisa to save
    I&S?  I couldn't really find any continuity in the story.  There
    were a few great lines and gags but I think the plot was really
    disjointed. ... I try not to be too critical of "The Simpsons"
    because I enjoy them as escapism, but, if I were grading that
    episode, I would give it a C+.

Chris Courtois - "The Day the Violence Died" was yet another wildly
    uneven offering from Swartzwelder. Some parts, especially the
    parodies, were as brilliant as anything from Swartzwelder's "Itchy
    & Scratchy: The Movie". Other parts, particularly the ending, were
    as tediously self-indulgent and overly self-referential as his
    "Bart Gets Famous". Balance the two extremes out, factor in the
    great guest voice work (3 guests, only one playing herself, and not
    an embarassment in the bunch), add a bonus point for a Disney
    reference (ok, so I'm biased, but hey, it's my list) and you get a
    B-.

Don Del Grande - A-minus - one of the better episodes this season,
    although it did slow down slightly at the beginning of the third
    act, and the ending was sort of "hanging".

Jason Hancock - This was a pretty good episode; why wasn't this on
    during sweeps month?  Lionel Hutz was great, as always; Kirk
    Douglas and Alex Rocco provided two good guest roles; and the
    writers managed to stay away from the overused "Bart and Lisa save
    the day" plot with an interesting twist.  Nice "Schoolhouse Rock"
    reference, too; it brought bac memories of the Saturday mornings
    of my childhood.  Grade:  A.

Norman J. Landis - If no one else wants to say it, let me say it.
    Brilliant!  There have been complaints lately, including from this
    corner, that OFF has gotten too predictable, too formulaic.  This
    ep bore no resemblance to any sitcom I've ever seen. ... Even the
    Constitution was handled in a wonderful fashion; the cartoon being
    a wonderful parody, and right wingers given the consolation of
    Bart's misguided but wonderful remarks. ... I know this doesn't
    count officially, but A+.

Haynes Lee - This would have been a good episode but Chester Lampwick
    had no redeeming qualities and was of no use for the last segment
    of the show.  Grade: B+

Veronica Marquez - Bar none the most surreal episode I've ever seen.
    I just sat there going "Eh?" after they brought in Lester and 
    Eliza.  I feel like I'm watching "The Outer Limits".  If I had to
    give it a grade, it would get a B-.

Daniel McCoy - I really liked the first parts of this episode.  
    Although the bum character got on my nerves, I thought that it had
    some of the funniest jokes I'd seen on the show in a long time.
    However, the endingwith the look-alikes left me cold.  The
    deconstuctionist-type ending was handled less creatively than in
    previous episodes when similar things happened.  I really wanted
    the kids to be the ones to save the studio.  On the other hand,
    the Schoolhouse rock parody almost singlehandedly redeemed it.
    A-/B+

John Murray - Grade: F-.  This episode was suckiest, bunch sucking
    episodes, that ever sucked.  Come on I didn't have a good laugh
    once in the two times I watched this episode, I am beginning to
    wish I hadn't bothered to watch it.  There a few decent scenes,
    like any of Hutz's but it's hard not to make Hutz not funny, and
    the Schoolhouse Rock parody was well done but not really that
    funny (it did give me a small laugh).  Even the comic guy was not
    funny and there was way too much of him, he only works in small
    spread out. 

Damian Penny - This episode had all the ingredients of a classic - a
    good, satirical plot; Itchy and Scratchy featured prominently; more
    meta-humour than I've ever seen in a single episode; and even an
    appearance by the great Lionel Hutz!  So what was wrong?  In my
    opinion, it was the same problem that marred "Bart the Fink" - the
    whole Lisa-and-Bart-as-detectives plot was taken almost a bit
    seriously, with the satire not as cutting as it could have been.
    All in all, a B- episode, raised to a B by an absolutely brilliant
    skewering of "Schoolhouse Rock" near the end.

Mark Richey - Usually, when the main story wraps up at the end of the
    second act, that means trouble.  However, the writers managed to
    pull off the last act by filling it with meta-humor and self-refs
    (something that the entire episode had a lot of).  Kirk Douglas
    did a good job as Chester, and it's great to see Alex Rocco back
    as Roger Myers, Jr.  Grade: B

Benjamin Robinson - A strange episode, to say the least.  Although not
    drop-dead funny, it has some good moments (the comic store guy's
    appearance, and the Itchy film are the highlights.)  The ending
    with Lester and Eliza was a novel twist.  The episode seemed too
    self-conscious, though, as if it were trying to telegraph "WE ARE
    GOING TO DEFY CONVENTION", rather than letting the viewer get the
    message naturally.  (B)

Rick Senger - A good story (possibly based on Simpsons Comics #1,
    which had a similar premise), and an okay episode.  Itchy and
    Scratchy were funny as usual, and the "I'm Just an Amendment to
    Be" HAD to be HILARIOUS to anyone familiar with 70s ABC School
    House Rock series.  However, this is Swartzwelder Lite again;
    JS is incredibly prolific, but only every second or third 'sode of
    late has had the balls of his older, more multi-layered outings.
    Still, overall, I'll take this one over many of this season.  B+

Yours Truly - Bart's words fit this episode best: "What the hell is
    going on?"  Many people are out searching to find the meaning
    behind Lester and Eliza, but I think the truth is the writers just
    threw it in.  (The 7F16 capsule has an interesting take on this.)
    As for the rest of the episode, it was kind of weak, especially
    the fact that there wasn't very much of I&S in it.  However, it
    is lifted up by the great I&S that _was_ there, Roger Myers, Lionel
    Hutz, and of course, "Amendment-to-Be".  B-.

AVERAGE GRADE: B-/C+ (2.85)

  Hutz: [screams]
-- He gave his word, "The Day the Violence Died"

% Chester claims that Myers stole all of his characters.

The only characters Myers could ever come up with were pathetic stick
figures with the words "Sarcastic Horse" and "Manic Mailman" printed on
them. And they stank.
-- Chester comments on Myers' talent, "The Day the Violence Died"

% But Myers Jr. calls this a lie.

 Hutz: Are you saying, _under oath_ Mr. Myers, that your father didn't
       steal any of the characters associated with your studio?
Myers: Well, I don't think I _am_ under oath, but... yes, my father
       created them all. Except for Flatulent Fox, that was based on a
       true story.
-- The inspiration of a cartoonist, "The Day the Violence Died"

Judge: Mr. Hutz, we've been in here for four hours. Do you have any
       evidence at all?
 Hutz: Well, your Honor, we've got plenty of hearsay and conjecture,
       those are _kinds_ of evidence.
-- The eternal question: where did he get his diploma?,
   "The Day the Violence Died"

% Myers' lawyer moves for dismissal, but Bart --guess what-- has an
% idea, and borrow $750 from Homer.

    Bart: Keep the trial going, I'll be right back.
    Hutz: Your Honor, I'd like to call all of my surprise witnesses
	  again.
Audience: [moans]
-- The usual, proven good ol' methods, "The Day the Violence Died"

% Bart goes to the comic store, and we hear the sound of a cash
% register.
%
% Back to the trial, Bart exhibits --surprise!-- the $750-worth drawing
% of Itchy he saw in the comic book store, which happens to be
% identical to the Itchy in "Manhattan Madness". However, the lawyer
% refutes this as being proof, since it isn't signed or dated.
%
% Chester helps him: "Look under the frame, Brad." After breaking the
% glass and tearing the painting a little, he finds something.

To Roger Myers, keep drawing, your moxie more than makes up for your
lack of talent. Your pal, Chester J. Lampwick, September 3, 1919
-- Chester's word of encouragement to Myers,
     "The Day the Violence Died"

% The audience is stunned.

Myers: Okay, maybe my dad did steal Itchy, but so what? Animation is
       built on plagiarism!
	[lawyer slaps his forehead]
       If it weren't for someone plagiarizing the Honeymooners, we
       wouldn't have the Flintstones. If someone hadn't ripped off Sgt.
       Bilko, they'd be no Top Cat. Huckleberry Hound, Chief Wiggum,
       Yogi Bear? Hah! Andy Griffith, Edward G. Robinson, Art Carney.
-- Er, don't forget Yogi Berra, "The Day the Violence Died"        

Myers: Your honor, you take away our right to steal ideas, where are
       they gonna come from? Her?  [points at Marge]
Marge: Uh... Hmm... How about... Ghostmutt?
-- I see your point, "The Day the Violence Died"

The court rules in favor of Mr. Lampwick. Itchy & Scratchy Studios will
pay a restitution of 800 billion dollars... though that amount will
probably come down a bit on appeal.
-- The judge delivers the verdict, "The Day the Violence Died"

% In front of Itchy & Scratchy Studios, Myers hands Chester his $800
% billion check, and lets it go after stuggling a bit.

  Myers: I hope you're happy, kid; the studio's bankrupt. You just
	 killed Itchy & Scratchy.
	  [closes the studio's gate, bearing a "Out of business" sign]
   Bart: We killed Itchy & Scratchy?
Chester: Good riddance. Wanna go celebrate? I feel like liver and
	 onions. [smacks his lips]
-- Can liver and onions be as funny as Itchy & Scratchy?,
   "The Day the Violence Died"

% As Chester walks away, every light and machine in Itchy & Scratchy
% Studios is shut down.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 14'43"]
%
% Back in OFF house, Chester repays Homer for all his troubles, and
% goes on the road, whistling "We're in the Money", to find himself the
% solid gold house he's always dreamed of.
%
% Meanwhile, others try to cope with the loss of Itchy & Scratchy, like
% Krusty...

Well, Itchy & Scratchy are gone, but here's a cartoon that tries to
make learning fun!
   [tries to laugh, then moans]
Sorry about this kids, but stay tuned; we've got some real good toy
commercials coming right up, I swear.
-- Krusty (At least he's not showing Worker & Parasite),
   "The Day the Violence Died"

% Until then, they have nothing else to air but an old Schoolhouse
% Rock.

Bart: What the hell is this?
Lisa: It's one of those campy '70s throwbacks that appeals to
      Generation Xers.
Bart: We need another Vietnam to thin out their ranks a little.
-- "The Day the Violence Died"

% They continue watching the atrocity until the end.

Lisa: So it's true: some cartoons _do_ encourage violence.
       [punches Bart]
Bart: Ow! We gotta get Itchy & Scratchy back.
Lisa: And soon!
       [punches Bart]
Bart: Ow!
Lisa: [chuckles]
-- And how, "The Day the Violence Died"

% Bart & Lisa go see Myers, who is now living at Worst Western, using
% some TV boxes as a desk.

 Bart: You've got to make more Itchy & Scratchy cartoons.
 Lisa: The judge says it's okay as long as you pay Mr. Lampwick
       royalties.
Myers: Royalties! Hah! I don't have the money to _produce_ the
       cartoons. I lost everything. I can't even keep my dad's head in
       the freakin' cryogenics center anymore.
	[shot of a thawing icebox, which starts shaking]
       [sarcasticly] You're comfortable in there, daddy?
-- So where's the rest of his body?, "The Day the Violence Died"

% Since they need money, Bart figures he could ask someone who has lots
% of it.

Chester:  [as Kent Brockman walks in front of his gold house]
	 Shoeshine, sir? Comb your hair for ya? Sir?
	  [Kents walks away in contempt]
	 Sir? Sir? Sir? Okay, catch you on the way back.
-- After all, he only won $130 million, "The Day the Violence Died"

% The kids try to get Chester into financing other Itchy & Scratchy
% cartoons, but he doesn't want to hear about it.

I don't need any more money, I'm not greedy. As long as I've got my
health, and my millions of dollars and my gold house and my rocket car,
I don't need anything else.
-- Chester, a simple man, "The Day the Violence Died"

% Ultimately, Bart turns to his father.

 Bart: Dad, can we have $183,000?
Homer: [Gets his wallet] What for?
 Bart: Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
Homer: Oh. Forget it!
-- "The Day the Violence Died"

% As a last resort, Bart reads through "Animation Legal Precedents", as
% Lisa investigates "Copyright Law: 1918-1923".

Lisa: [moans] I give up, there's nothing we can do.
Bart: Yeah, I agree. You wanna start on trying to get Apu out of jail?
Lisa: Okay.
       [they pull out "Public Nudity: Codes and Statutes"]
-- A side of him we didn't know, "The Day the Violence Died"

% But Marge knows them better.  "Wait, kids, you can't give up on Itchy
% & Scratchy, you're so good at these things."  Marge names several
% situations in which Bart and Lisa lend an, ahem, helping hand.
% Lisa agrees, and takes a look at Bart's book; it doesn't take long
% that she spots something. They both race their bicycles to Itchy &
% Scratchy Studios.

  Bart: What a perfect plan. Now, Roger Myers will tell as just...
 Myers: [announcing the studio's re-opening]
	And so when no one could think of a plan to resurect Itchy &
	Scratchy, a young boy, a wonderful irrepressible young boy,
	took it on his own to solve the problem. He discovered that the
	postal service's Mr. Zip. was just a rip-off of my father's
	stick figure character Manic Mailman.
	 [crowd murmors]
	So the government gave me a _huge_ cash settlement, and Itchy &
	Scratchy Studios is back in business.
	 [engines start up again]
	Thanks to you, Lester.
	 [a Tracey-Ullman-era Bart comes on stage]
  Bart: What the hell is going on?
  Lisa: I don't know, but it looks like you might have a little
	competition all of a sudden.
Lester: Thanks everybody, but I couldn't have done all this without the
	help of my brainy sister Eliza.
	 [a Tracey-Ullman-era Lisa joins him]
  Lisa: [gasps]
-- Bart and Lisa meet their alter egos, "The Day the Violence Died"

% Apu comes on stage:

I do owe many thanks to Lester and Eliza. This is a great vindication
for anybody who has ever taken a bath, went to get the paper, fell
down, and the door slam behind them and the doorknow break off.
-- A day in the life of Apu, "The Day the Violence Died"

Krusty: And I'd like to thank Lester for reuniting me with my estranged
	wife.
	 [applause]
  Bart: I never even heard about that.
-- They probably lost the script, "The Day the Violence Died"

% Effectively, Lisa is confused too.

 Bart: I guess you don't need it now, but, we had a plan too.
Myers: Hey, great, listen, write it down and mail it to last week, when
       I might've cared. I've got cartoons to make, kids.
-- That's his way of saying "Thank you", "The Day the Violence Died"

% It seems that everything has returned to normal, and Itchy & Scratchy
% is back on the air.  The episode shown is dedicated to Lester and
% Eliza, "for making all this possible". Marge suggests that Bart and
% Lisa must be happy to see their "cute little friends" back on the
% air. Lisa says that "technically everything worked out all right",
% but as Bart explains: "I wasn't the one who solved the problem, and
% neither was Lisa. There's something unsettling about that."
%
% At that moment, Lester rides on his skateboard in front of the house,
% and him and Bart stare at each other, while some dramatic music is
% heard.
