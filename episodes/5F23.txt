==============================================================================
Blackboard:     SHOOTING PAINTBALLS IS NOT AN ART FORM

Couch gag:      Tiny Simpsons climb up onto the couch, and giant Santa's
                Little Helper comes and takes Homer away.

==============================================================================
> Didja notice...
==============================================================================
   ... there are only a couple of titles in "Just Crichton and King Bookstore"
       but the titles available are stocked by the shelf-full?
   ... a bunch of people drawn with bald heads at the front of the crowd
       "welcoming" the team back?
   ... even the people with #1 foam hands join in the riot?
   ... Homer looks amazed by the orientation film even though he didn't
       follow it?
   ... the low protein gruel resembles the purple stuff OFF used to eat in
       the Ullman shorts?
   ... Lenny remains in the Christian church despite seeing the orientation
       film?
   ... Smithers doesn't seem that bothered after Mr. Burns falls from a very
       high up balcony after catching on fire?  (Seems uncharacteristic, for
       anyone really, since Burns could be dead. But especially Smithers.)
   ... Pimple Faced Kid starts the episode as luggage security, and by the
       time the Movementarians are taking over, he's security at the
       Movementarians agricultural compound?
   ... when "the Leader" (Marge) signals for the family, it looks like it's
       going to be Krusty due to the gloves?
   ... Maggie's pacifier drops out of her mouth when she sees the hover-bikes?

Anthony Dean:
   ... even Maggie was brainwashed by the cult (by Barney the Dinosaur, no
       less... make your own jokes here)?
   ... Gerald (the baby with one eyebrow) is seen?
   ... Frink still chanted the Batman/Leader chant while lying on the table?
   ... Smithers' eagerness about the idea of kneeling before Burns?
   ... both Lisa and Marge swear in this episode (and both say "damned")?
   ... Maggie knows how to ride a tricycle?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Bart was taken out of school to watch the team arrive, yet Mrs.
       Krabappel is there as well?
   ... Homer's eyes bulge when he hears about the free movie?
   ... in the picture of the Simpsons that Kent Brockman shows, Maggie doesn't
       have her hair ribbon?
   ... Ned's dartboard has dart holes on the wall around it?

Haynes Lee:
   ... airliner at airport is a three-engine L-1011?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... after Maggie drops her pacifier in the hoverbike scene, she doesn't
       bother to get it back?

- Lars Westergren investigates previous Scientology references:

   As most of you know, Nancy Cartwright, voice of Bart Simpson is a
   Scientologist. Being a fan of the Simpsons I have recently looked through
   old shows. I used to think that there was nothing either pro or con
   scientology in the Simpsons show. That in itself might say something since
   the Simpsons show could probably do some great things with the material, it
   is just the stuff they would love to joke about.

   But this time when I watched, I suddenly saw one thing I am pretty sure is
   Scientology related, and a couple of more that are somewhat indirectly
   related to the subject.

   "Moaning Lisa" [7G06]:
   In this episode, Lisa befriends Bleeding Gums Murphy. Homer and Marge are
   standing facing each other talking about what to do with Lisa. A painting
   is hanging between them on the wall in the center of the screen, depicting
   a volcano looking *very* much like the volcano on Dianetics covers.

   "Burns' Heir" [1F16]:
   Mr Burns decides to adopt Bart ("ahh...a creature of pure malevolence. A
   suitable heir to my fortune") and proceeds to brainwash him against his
   real parents. Homer and Marge try to get him away from Mr Burns' mansion
   and back into their own home. They hire a deprogrammer who is seen carrying
   in a small moving bundle into a motel room during the night. The next day
   Homer and Marge are anxiously waiting outside. The deprogrammer comes out
   assuring them that their son is back with them. Instead, Hans the Moleman
   comes out of the motel room with empty eyes saying "Mom, Dad, I missed
   you."

   "Sideshow Bob Roberts" [2F02]:
   Lisa: Because we all know you're a naive pawn -- puppet, if you will -- of 
         the most diabolical political genius Springfield has ever known:
         Birchibald T. Barlow! [Barlow stammers incoherently] You don't have
         the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you?
   Bart: You were just Barlow's lackey.
   Lisa: You were Ronny to his Nancy!
   Bart: Sonny to his Cher!
   Lisa: Ringo to his rest of the Beatles!

= The second Hare Krishna guy sitting on the floor next to the standing one
  seen moments earlier isn't visible when Homer walks past.

= When Marge is looking at the Movementarian information booklet over dinner,
  her legs are shaking (looks unintentional).

c CC says "way above normal weight" at Homer's bullbaiting session but is not
  in the soundtrack. {hl}

* Despite Skinner's accusation that Homer's failed at "everything he's ever
  tried", their Be Sharps careers (complete with a Grammy) would suggest
  otherwise. {ad}

* How can Homer give the deed to his house away when he has a mortgage? {ddg}

= The dust from the Rolls Royce has nearly cleared up, and it suddenly
  appears on Moe and Sideshow Mel instantaneously, in what looks like a
  single frame.

* Lisa should by in a different class to Bart, since they are in different
  grades.

* Burns says he hasn't heard of "The Leader" even though at the beginning of
  the orientation film you can see him seated.

* If everybody gave their houses and life savings to the leader, how did they
  get them back? {ddg}

? Ironic that Bart would make that "Church, cult, cult, church" comment, since
  he's voiced by a member of the Church of Scientology.

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold: A mixed bag, but a positive one.  There were some misfired
   and overused gags, to be sure.  On the other hand, the topical nature of
   the humor and the high quality of many of the jokes made up for it.  There
   has been precious little this season to compare with the creation of "Burns
   the God" or the great "Prisoner" reference when Marge escapes from the
   compound.  (B)

Anthony Dean: I'm not sure what to say about this episode; while portions of
   it were funny (the scene with Burns, for instance), other parts felt
   downright odd (the obstacle course in front of the compound). After seeing
   the gloved hand, I was kind of wondering if this would be another scam of
   Krusty's (a la Kamp Krusty), but alas it was not so (it might've been
   funnier, though). It was also nice to see Maggie used (instead of being
   either forgotten or used as an armpiece for Marge).  (C+)

John Isles IV: This episode was one of the better ones this season...
   Alongside "Bart Star".  In comparison to "Lisa the Skeptic", an episode
   which came out earlier this season, this one dealt with religious beliefs
   considerably better, since more than one person didn't go for the "the end
   will come sooner than you think" deal.   This is an episode where the story
   relies on humor, and this one clearly succeeds.  Many of the gags were
   pulled off well, specifically Mr. Burns' "God" outfit-- I must admit, when
   Mr. Burns did wear the plastic suit and the beard, he did look macho.
   Bart's brainwash attempt was also successful.  Just a bit of irony though--
   Wouldn't the Movementarians have <rejected> the lawyers?  In spite of not
   everyone liking this piece of work, I enjoyed it.  Not a true-clad classic,
   but very entertaining.  (B+)

Haynes Lee: More familiar territory covered. (C+)

Jake Lennington: A pleasant surprise.  I was expecting a rather dull outing
   and "Homer the Great" clone, but it stands out enough to be original and
   funny.  My only gripe is the way the town flocks together like they did in
   "Lisa the Skeptic".  It always seems to be Springfield vs. OFF.  (B+)

John Ogan: So many conflicting emotions regarding the latest episode.  I don't
   know how to grade this... for one thing, I agree with their messages about
   the dangers of cults and the importance in thinking for oneself, however,
   the way in which it was presented was strange, strange, strange.  Homer was
   such an idiot it was terrible.  The rapidity in which the townspeople were
   converted was kind of unbelievable; we're going to have to assume that
   there was something in that video that played on the subconscious. This is
   a half-hour show, and things have to be simplified accordingly, I can give
   the writers this one and suspend my disbelief and quibbles for
   argumentative accuracy.

   Well, now that we're done with that, we're left with Lisa.  She's converted
   because of her need to get good grades in "school", sort of in an
   irrational kind of way only seen before in "The PTA Disbands", though this
   conversion takes place only after a frustrated outburst in which her
   independent thinking conflicts with her need to be praised.  I'm displeased
   with this; this isn't the Lisa I know, the same Lisa who went against all
   authority and what she was expected to believe in "Lisa the Skeptic".  This
   isn't the same girl I remember from "Bart vs. Thanksgiving" and "Moaning
   Lisa".  So now, with Lisa under the control of the Movementarians, the role
   of the nonconformist is thrust into Marge's lap, who works with Ned,
   Willie, the powers of beer, and of course Rev. Lovejoy.

   Why did Marge get this role?  Well, I believe that the writers are trying
   to take some of the burden off Lisa's shoulders.  They might guess that
   the Simpson-watching population is getting tired of Lisa's moral crusades,
   and they're probably right.  It wouldn't have been a problem with me, but
   it might have just brought on more anti-Lisa posts, so OK, we'll give the
   position of head deprogrammer to Marge.  There are no words to define the
   scene where she escapes... what the hell was up with that bubble rising out
   of the river? [see references --hmw]

   So with the help of Willie, Marge brings Homer back by tempting him with
   beer, and brings the children back with flying bicycles.  Homer displays
   even more cleverness than he did in "Bart Carney" upon return to the
   cult.  The Leader flies away in a cheap ship, crashes, and everything is
   back to normal.  OK, while I prefer episodes that have to do with
   reality, I can appreciate wacky humor as much as the next messed up child
   of the 80's.  Still, I miss the days when Simpson plots were a little
   less screwed up and dealt more with intra-family relationships and had
   reasonable, believable characters written by intelligent, on-the-mark
   writers who could address some of the issues in my life and confirm
   my sense of reason...but I love politics and issues of the outside world as
   well.  It doesn't hurt me when they have plots dealing with social
   issues that need discussion, and this was one of them.

   I enjoyed the scenes with Smithers and Burns in this episode.  "We'll use
   this special "K" as our symbol!"  and of course, what is probably the
   most blatant 'Smithers is gay' remark ever, is Smithers' "With pleasure..."
   response to "Would you kneel before me?".
   I enjoyed this episode.  It discussed an issue that has been important to
   me in the past, namely thinking for oneself.  Not that I don't allow
   myself to listen to those that have brilliant thoughts.  As Patti Smith
   wrote, I seek to "Be A Gathering" while relying on my own judgment for
   organization.

   However, my declinist leanings create some inner dissonance in that I
   still have fond memories of what the Simpsons used to be.  I don't know
   if I can grade this.  There's no letter grade out there that describes
   what I think of this episode, an odd mesh of positive and negative.
   [Grade: Abstains]

Tom Rinschler: The first act was a bit slow, with only a few good jokes (the
   best was towards the end when the cultists say that Homer's mind must be
   the strongest they've seen).  The second and third acts, however, were a
   marked improvement, with lots of LOLs and ROFLs.  It was a great satire on
   cults, religion, and even deprogramming. The wonderful Simpsonesque ending.
   What we thought was a fraud wasn't a fraud... but really it was.  If it
   hadn't been for the slow start, this would be an all-time classic. The
   strength of the second and third acts more than make up for this however.
   (A)

Benjamin Robinson: This episode can serve as sort of a litmus test for
   "Simpson" fans. People who like the older shows will give a "C" or lower,
   while the "New shows rule" crowd will perhaps give an "A".  I'm in-between,
   so I'll award a "B-". The show's best sequence, curiously, is also the
   most superfluous, but it's generally funny when taken on its own merits.
   (B-)

Yours truly: A very outlandish episode, but also very funny. Too many great
   gags to count, but the story is too unlikely, and an episode can't just
   survive on jokes alone. Homer's constant shouting of the word "jerkass"
   towards the beginning of the episode was completely unnecessary and not
   funny in any way. However, in my opinion, this is a fairly strong episode.
   (B-)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Cult Favorites

Benjamin Robinson: The behavior and practices of cults general is the focus of
   this episode, and the show obliquely references a few cults in particular.

   * The Church of Scientology -- This religion, founded by science fiction
     writer (!) L. Ron Hubbard, has been much in the news lately.  This group
     believes in, well, I'm not sure just what they believe in because they've
     been quite secretive about that.  (What you read in the "Dianetics" books
     is supposedly just the tip of the iceberg.)  What <is> known is that they
     are not a group that takes criticism gracefully.  The Scientologists have
     a reputation for vigorously opposing their detractors, either only
     through their lawyers, or covertly by "digging up dirt" on their
     opponents.  Scientologists have also been accused of canceling other
     people's Usenet posts that they feel unfairly criticize the Church.  For
     their part, the Scientologists deny any covert action, but do concede
     that "certain individuals" may go overboard defending their faith.

     Just a few minutes ago, "60 Minutes" aired a report on a fight between
     the Church of Scientology and the Cult Awareness Network (CAN).  CAN
     accused the Scientologists of being a ruthless organization that kept its
     recruits in line through brainwashing and threats.  The Scientologists
     countered that CAN was a narrow-minded group of religious bigots who
     would kidnap people and "deprogram" them against their will.  In the
     legal fighting that ensued CAN went bankrupt.  They were bought out by
     ... the Scientologists, who now operate CAN as a wholly-owned subsidiary.

     In case you've missed reading about it in <alt.tv.simpsons> Nancy
     Cartwright [voice of Bart Simpson --hmw] is also a Scientologist (as is
     most of non-Jewish Hollywood, it would appear).  I suspect this alone had
     a chilling effect on how far the writers could go in spoofing Mr.
     Hubbard's new religion.

     * The Heaven's Gate Cult -- Another group of people who made the news
     recently, the Heaven's Gaters fit the more traditional definition of a
     cult:  A small, isolated group of people who revolved around the
     teachings of a charismatic leader.  In this case, the leader was a former
     college music teacher named Marshall Applewhite, who was known as Do (say
     "D'oh") to his followers.  Do's beliefs were unorthodox, to say the
     least, by mainstream standards.  The central tenet was that their bodies
     were just temporary vessels by which they were to accomplish their
     Earthly duties.  At the appointed time, a starship piloted by superior
     aliens was to release them from their tour of duty here and take them
     home.  Applewhite took the appearance of the Hale-Bopp comet as his cue
     -- he was convinced that the aliens were trailing along behind it.  Now
     the Heaven's Gaters had to shed their bodies here to join their alien
     brethren.  They gathered together on their rented mansion compound and
     poisoned themselves in a mass suicide.

     * The Unification Church (a.k.a. "The Moonies -- don't confuse this with
     the UNITARIAN Church, by the way) -- The original mind-control cult, or
     the first one that people heard of, anyway.  Led by Reverend Moon, a
     mysterious Korean, many of their practices came to define "cult" for many
     people:  isolation from society, the use of mind control and
     brainwashing, and the acquisition of all their followers worldly goods.
     In fact, most people felt that the cult was an elaborate scam to fleece
     people.

     One thing for sure, the Moonies sure knew how to grab headlines. In the
     Seventies, Rev. Moon paired up about four hundred (I'm fuzzy on the
     figure, so this may not be right) men and women and married them in a
     mass wedding ceremony.  Many years later, a television news program
     tracked down several of these couples to see how they did.  As it turns
     out, they did no better or worse than people who found and married each
     other the usual way.  The divorce rate among the Moonie couples mirrored
     that of the nation as a whole.  The Moonies have also made themselves
     felt in Hollywood -- they financed the movie "Inchon," about a battle in
     the Korean War.

     * M.O.V.E. combined elements of cults and black separatist politics. No
     one is certain what M.O.V.E. stands for -- one wag suggested "Movement
     Opposed to Virtually Everything."  They set themselves up in
     Philadelphia, where they made such a nuisance of themselves that the
     police laid siege to their headquarters.  The mayor of Philadelphia
     approved a plan to drop an incendiary device on the M.O.V.E. house --
     literally, to bomb his own city.  This was a bad move, for it was a row
     house (a series of houses adjacent to one another) and when one catches
     on fire, the entire row is vulnerable.  Several families who had nothing
     to do with M.O.V.E. lost their homes, and the city government would up
     looking worse than the cult.

     * Promise Keepers are <not> a cult, although you might get that
     impression from "The Leader's" lament that he did not stay with them.
     Actually, they're a Christian men's organization that promotes men being
     responsible fathers and husbands.  The Promise Keepers, like the cults,
     have run into some controversy -- some people feel that it promotes men
     being dominant over their wives. The Promise Keepers deny this and say
     they want to foster an equal partnership.  I suspect that people favoring
     both viewpoints have all found a home in this organization.

     In addition to these specific movements, "The Joy of Sect" demonstrates
     other cult tactics.  Many cults, for example, make their initial contact
     through seemingly benign meetings.  There, they try to wear down their
     recruits' will.  Often, new cult members will be asked to sign over their
     worldly possessions as a show of loyalty and faith. Cultists may also be
     asked to support the cult through their labor (like Homer and Marge in
     the bean field).  After they have joined, members find it difficult to
     quit.  Sometimes, the cult is physically guarded (as in the case of the
     Movementarians).  We also get to see deprogrammers in action.  Like the
     cults, the deprogrammers are controversial.  Their supporters believe
     that they rescue cult members from a life of exploitation, while
     opponents say they interfere with the free practice of religion.

     There is no truth to the rumor that alt.tv.simpsons is a cult.  Now if
     you'll excuse me, it is time to serve the Great Master Matt.


>> Just Crichton and King

Crichton and King are two well established and extremely popular authors,
   Michael Crichton and Stephen King.


>> Have you heard of Krishna Consciousness?

If not, I'll tell you a little about it. Krishna Consciousness is a term
   used by Hare Krishna devotees to describe their philosophy and way of life.
   The religion  -- Indian in origin -- spread to the West in the Sixties and
   Seventies when A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada travelled to America to
   spread the religion as requested by his spiritual master. The religion in
   many aspects is similar to Hinduism, especially the stories told by
   devotees of the religion, but the rules are a little stricter.


>> Car Watch, Part III

Benjamin Robinson: Lisa correctly identified "The Leader's" car as a Rolls
   Royce.  I'll narrow it down further:  It's a Rolls Royce Phantom VI.  (Want
   one of your own?  You'll have to hit the used car lots, because Rolls
   recently stopped making them.)  The Phantom VI is custom built -- Rolls
   Royce didn't even start making them until they had your order in hand --
   and cost over a half-million dollars.  Determining how Marge, Willie, and
   Rev. Lovejoy managed to get an identical Phantom VI for their rescue
   attempt is left as an exercise for the reader.


>> The next never-ending thread

Benjamin Robinson: I think we can stop debating whether or not Smithers is
   gay, and start debating on whether or not Burns knows it.  Notice his
   reaction when Smithers says he'd be glad to kneel before Burns.  I think
   the old man is beginning to catch on, but isn't sure yet.  Perhaps if he
   read this newsgroup... [alt.tv.simpsons --hmw]


>> Movementarians/Scientologists

Mark Dallara {md} compares the two groups:

   - Movementarian uniforms - the light blue shirt, dark blue pants, and dark
     ties worn by the recruiters were an echo of the clothing worn by members
     of the Sea Organization, an "elite" group within Scientology.  If you
     walk around downtown Clearwater, you will see these folks (commonly
     referred to as the Sea Borg on a.r.s) moving around in droves.

   - Orientation film - Homer and his family are recruited into the cult
     through a free film.  One of Scientology's "body-routing" tactics is to
     give people free passes to a nutball orientation movie at one of their
     missions or orgs.

   - Trillion-year contract - Homer mentions that he has signed over all his
     money, the house, and even himself for a trillion years.  Scientologists
     who become Sea Org members sign contracts that bind them to the church for
     one billion years, and members are routinely pressured to liquidate assets
     and take out loans to pay for $cientology courses.

   - Judgement session - the scene with the new Movementarian recruits
     shouting insults at Homer is reminiscent of a Scientology practice called
     "bullbaiting".  It is part of a "training routine" (TR), which is
     intended to teach Scientologists how to deal with verbal confrontations.

   - The lawyers - the Movementarians bring out their biggest guns towards the
     end of the show... the attorneys.  Scientology is known to be an
     extremely litigious cult, and the founder wrote several documents which
     explicitly direct the members to abuse the legal system to silence
     criticism.

   - Tax-exempt status - At one point, a reference is made to
     Movementarianism's tax-exempt status.  This is a hot topic with respect
     to Scientology, because the secret agreement between CoS and the IRS has
     recently been leaked, and the NY Times has done a front-page story on how
     they pressured the IRS into surrender.

   - Spaceships - a UFO theme was central to the Movementarian belief system.
     While UFO elements are not unique to Scientology, it does contain several
     separate references to spaceships, invasions, and extra-planetary
     stations.

   - The Leader - bore a vague resemblence to L. Ron Hubbard, and that the
     Movementarian claims that he invented morse code and other crap is
     similar to Scientology's absurd biographical sketch of the con man who
     started it all.


>> Miscellaneous

- MPAA rating: PG-L {ddg}

- Barney put his "liver back in" on the wrong side -- the liver is on the
  right. {mw}

- Haynes Lee's alterna-title for the episode is "I. Ron Butterfly".


>> Thoughts

- Ned's drinking habits here will probably be subject to more debate after
  this episode. {ad}

-- "The Joy of Sect"

Marge: But what if they try and talk us into something?
Homer: [Humored] Marge, Marge, Marge... remember when those smooth-talking

% fishing to the tune of the 60s Batman series theme song).  The Movementarian
% representatives arrive.

 Jane: It certainly is a beautiful day. We should thank the leader.

% looking spaceship with a visible string).

Once we collect enough money for fuel, our Leader will throw open the doors
of the forbidden barn where we will all board our intergalactic vehicle...
[quickly] rows one through thirty first. Upon our arrival, we will begin our

-- Movementarians orientation film, "The Joy of Sect"

 Carl: Hey, I don't know about you, but they're not exactly winning me over
       with these lousy production values here. I'm gonna slip out.
       [As soon as Carl stands up a spotlight shines on him in the otherwise
       dark room.]
Voice: Uh, you're free to leave whenever you want, but would you mind telling
       us why?
 Carl: Oh, I just didn't, uh.. I didn't think it, um.. oh, it's.. it's pretty
       good. [sits back down.]
 Otto: Man, this whole place puffs of the wacky tobbacy. I'm outta here.
       [As soon as Otto stands up, the spotlight highlights him.]

Loving serenity. It's about damn time!
-- Moe, "The Joy of Sect"

% Everyone seems to be in awe of the leader.

Homer: Wait, I'm confused about the movie. So the cops knew that internal
       affairs were setting them up?
 Glen: What are you talking about? There is nothing like that in there!
Homer: Oh, you see when I get bored I make up my own movie. I have a very
       short attention span.
 Jane: But our point is very simple. You see, when--
Homer: Oh, look! A bird! [runs out of the room, laughing, and chases a bird.]
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% They must try other methods to win Homer over. Everybody is sat around
% Homer in a circle.

   Jane: The circle of judgment never fails to destroy their self esteem.
         Then he'll be ours to mold.
   Glen: Let the judgment begin. I'll get the ball rolling. You're a fat
         idiot.
 Barney: Yeah, lose some weight!
         [Everyone is making comments about Homer's weight problem.]
  Homer: [Unaffected] Heh, yeah, I guess I could lose a few pounds. And
         I can be kind of thick sometimes. [laughs]
Skinner: You've failed at everything you've ever tried!
  Homer: Woah, you got my number on that one, buddy! This is a smart group!
    Moe: And your stink brings tears to my eyes!
  Homer: Now, wait a minute, Moe!
         [Homer points at Moe, getting a whiff of his armpit on the way.]
         Oh, my mistake.
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% They must try other means. Everybody sits at a long table, eating some gruel
% and looking very tired.

 Jane: Why isn't our low-protein gruel wearing down his resistance like all
       the others?
 Glen: It doesn't wear down your resistance if you eat a whole month's supply!
       He even ate mine!
-- That's no man, "The Joy of Sect"

% Homer is eating low-protein gruel like there's no tomorrow.

 Jane: Start a chant! Everybody loves a droning, repetetive chant.
 Glen: Attention, everybody. Let's all give thanks to the Leader for this
       glorious day!
 Both: The Leader is good, the Leader is great, we surrender our will as of
       this date!
  All: [Except Homer] The Leader is good, the Leader is great, we surrender
       our will as of this date!
 Jane: It's no use. He's obviously the most powerful mind we've ever dealt
       with!
 Glen: Or... nananananananana Leader! Nananananananana Leader!
  All: [Except Homer] Nananananananana Leader! Nananananananana Leader!
       [Homer starts gaining interest.] Leader! Leader! Leader!
                                                 Homer: Batman!  I mean,
       Leader! I love the Leader!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% Back at the Simpsons home.

Marge: You <what>?
Homer: Come again, Marge?
Marge: You <what>?
Homer: I've joined the Movementarians, and so have all of you!
Marge: We <what>?
Homer: All I had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house and
       a commitment of ten trillion years of labour!
-- What a great deal, "The Joy of Sect"

Marge: I can't go along with this, Homer!
Homer: [angry] Marge, when I join an underground cult I expect a little support
       from my family!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

 Lisa: Dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?
Homer: I have not been brainwashed! [zombie-like] Kill the girl...
Marge: Homer!
Homer: [Back to normal] What? What did I say?
-- Pass the potatoes! "The Joy of Sect"

Church, cult, cult, church. So we get bored someplace else every Sunday. Does
this really change our day to day lives?
-- Bart, "The Joy of Sect"

% Apparently, it does. Thanks to Homer's actions, the family have to move to
% the Movementarian agricultural compound to be closer to the leader in
% service.

Marge: I'm not leaving my home!
       [Some suit-men come in, holding the deed to the house.]
  Man: [Friendly] Oh yes you are! I'm afraid it's our home now. This house
       will become the new local welcome center for this district!
Homer: And it didn't cost us a dime.
-- Joy, "The Joy of Sect"

% Meanwhile, Kent Brockman reports the news.

Springfield has been overrun by a strange and almost certainly <evil> sect,
calling themselves the Movementarians. In exchange for your home and all your
money, the Leader of this way out and.. wrong religion, claims he'll take
believers away on his spaceship to the planet "Blisstonia". Excuse my
editorial laugh. [laughs] But-- [pause] Ladies and gentlemen, I just learned
of a change in this station's management! Welcome, Movementarians! Continue
to improve our lives! I love you, perfect Leader.. and new CEO of KBBL
broadcasting!
-- Kent Brockman news report, "The Joy of Sect"

% Over in the Movementarian's agricultural compound, the Simpsons are settling
% in.

 Glen: Homer Simpson, your family will be housed here for the first 100,000
       years. Then something might open in a double.
Homer: Hah! Why even unpack?
-- "The Joy of Sect"

 Lisa: Dad and all these other people are obviously the product of mental
       conditioning.
 Bart: Yeah, maybe it'll wear off, like his interest in CB radio.
Homer: That's a negatory, good buddy!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% Bart seems to think it's cool. Especially when he pretends he's in a zombie
% movie.

This is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical
havoc. These rogues in robes haven't met the likes of Bart Simpson before.
[Evil laugh]
-- Bart, "The Joy of Sect"

% Bart leaves the room, carrying his Li'l Bastard Mischief Kit, but returns
% momentarily, brainwashed by the Movementarian guy and his Li'l Bastard
% Brainwashing Kit.
% The Movementarians seem to have the majority of the town in their clutches.
% However, Reverend Lovejoy remains true to his Christian faith, and is
% conducting a sermon to a near-empty church.

This so called "new religion" is nothing but a pack of weird rituals and
chants designed to take away the money of fools.  Let us say the Lord's
prayer 40 times, but first let's pass the collection plate!
-- Reverend Lovejoy's church sermon, "The Joy of Sect"

% However, the collection plate only has a couple of coins after going
% around.
% Back at the agricultural compound, the family harvest lima beans.

Homer: See Marge, our lives are so much better now!
       [The Movementarian guy drives past with a megaphone.]
 Glen: You two, stop talking and resume the lima bean harvest!
-- So much better, "The Joy of Sect"

When we got married you promised by our harvesting days were over!
-- Marge, "The Joy of Sect"

% For the first time, the forbidden barn opens, and a Rolls Royce exits.
% The Leader's presence is felt!

              [The Leader's car blows dust all over Moe and Sideshow Mel.]
         Moe: I'm covered in the dust of the leader! He favours me!
Sideshow Mel: I am even dustier! Dustier than thou!
              [The Leader's car goes through some sloppy mud and Homer gets
              covered.]
         Moe: [Bitter] Oh, look who the new pet is!
       Homer: [Near tears] I've never been so happy!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% At SNPP...

Mr. Burns: Smithers, why haven't I heard of this "The Leader"? He's as rich
           and wicked as I, but he seems to enjoy tax exempt status!
 Smithers: Actually, sir, with our creative book-keeping and corporate loop
           holes we only pay three dollars a year.
Mr. Burns: [Shocked] You're right, we're getting screwed!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% Burns decides the only way to reach the same level as the Leader so he too
% can enjoy tax exempt status is to form his new religion.

Mr. Burns: You see me as a God, right, Smithers?
 Smithers: Absolutely, sir!
Mr. Burns: You'd kneel before me?
 Smithers: Boy, would I!
Mr. Burns: Yes.. uh..
-- "The Joy of Sect"

Mr. Burns: I'll form my own religion, with it's own symbol.
           [Burns starts sketching down a symbol.]
           We'll use this special K!
 Smithers: I believe that's already a breakfast cereal, sir.
Mr. Burns: Do people worship it?
 Smithers: In a way...
Mr. Burns: Alright, then... how about this?
           [Sketches another symbol, which is the Mickey Mouse ears.]
 Smithers: Ah, why don't you leave the symbol to me, sir?
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% Soon enough, the unveiling of Burns' new religion is afoot, complete with
% helicopters, dramatic music, fireworks, and giant statues of a muscular,
% bearded version of Mr. Burns. Smithers and Burns (who is wearing fake
% plastic golden colored muscles) make their way onto the balcony, high above
% crowds of people.

Mr. Burns: Ahoy-hoy, lowly mortals. In addition to working for me, you may
           now praise me as your almighty!
 Smithers: Amen, sir! Mmmmm...
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% A spark from a firework lands on Burns' beard, setting it alight, and in
% turn melting Burns' plastic suit. Burns is on fire. Smithers tries to put
% him out, while Burns rolls around, but he ends up falling from the balcony
% to their ground far, far below.

Meh, he's alright. But he's no bowl of Special K! [holds up box of Special K
and kisses it.]
-- Lenny, "The Joy of Sect"

% Back at the compound, the Movementarians are about to embark on a mass
% marriage. Everybody is dressed for the occassion, in wedding clothes.

Marge: This is ridiculous, we're already married!
Homer: But Marge, we're not <mass> married!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

        [Barney and Otto appear, with linked arms.]
Barney: At least you got to <choose> your mate, we got matched up on the
        printout!
  Otto: Remember our agreement. <I'm> the man!
Barney: You da man!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

         [Skinner is to be wed to his mother.]
Skinner: I could have done a lot worse, mother.
  Agnes: Speak for yourself.
-- "The Joy of Sect"

So. Do you enjoy comic books?
-- Comic Book Guy to his new wife in a cult mass marriage, "The Joy of Sect"

% Meanwhile, class is being taught... the Movementarian way.

Mrs. Krabappel: And who can tell me where thunder and lightning come from?
                Yes, Bart?
          Bart: The Leader, ma'am.
Mrs. Krabappel: Very good, Bart! And who invented Morse Code?
          Bart: Oh, I should know this one... the.. the Leader?
Mrs. Krabappel: Ah, correct again!
-- Movementarian class, "The Joy of Sect"

% Lisa can't take it anymore. She kicks her desk down, but then contemplates
% whether or not it's right to rebel -- after all, it could affect her grades.
% Meanwhile, the younger kids are entertained by Barney the Dinosaur, who
% apparently is under the Leader's influence, too.
% Homer and Marge eat dinner.

Homer: These lima beans are even better than the ones we had for breakfast
       and lunch! Oh! A lima bean that looks just like the Leader! I'll put it
       with the others.
Marge: Homer, you know I always try to put the best face on everything, but
       there's no face on that damn bean!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

      Marge: We hate it here, and your family wants to leave!
Bart & Lisa: [Zombie-like] No we don't, mother. We love the Leader!

      Marge: Noooooooooo!! [Suddenly cheerful] Alrighty, time for bed!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% Marge decides she's going to leave. It's night time, and she arrives at the
% exit of the compound. Pimple faced kid is on security, and tells Marge that
% she can leave any time she likes. But looking at the surroundings, the
% terrain is littered with landmines, vicious dogs, gators in water, and
% barbed wire. Marge uses a stick to propel herself from the ground over the
% fence, and then puts it in an alligators mouth and hops over their backs to
% reach land on the other side. Things are going fine until a giant balloon,
% ala the Prisoner, rises from the water and chases her. However, Marge
% escapes and the balloon thing has to make do with second best -- Hans
% Moleman.
% At the church, Reverend Lovejoy has apparently decided it's all over, and
% is pouring petrol around the church.

Ohh... I never thought I'd have to do this again.
-- Reverend Lovejoy, pouring petrol around the church, "The Joy of Sect"

% Marge runs into the church.

           Marge: [gasping for breath] Reverend Lovejoy, you have to help me!
                  My entire family has been taken in by the evil

               Marge: No, no, no, just the first two!
Groundskeeper Willie: Alright, I'll throw in the killing for free!
-- I'm beggin' ya! "The Joy of Sect"

% Back at the compound, a familiar looking Rolls Royce approaches Homer, Bart,

% window and signals for the Simpsons to come in. Once inside, Marge, Lovejoy,
% and Groundskeeper Willie are inside.

Marge, you're the leader? You don't look anything like the beans!

Groundskeeper Willie: Knock him out, Reverend!
                      [Reverend tries with a baseball bat, but to no avail.]
    Reverend Lovejoy: Oh, the devil has given him superhuman strength!
Groundskeeper Willie: Give me that, you noodle armed choir boy!
                      [Willie can't knock Homer out, either.]
    Reverend Lovejoy: Well that didn't do it, Mr. Kilt.

Kent Brockman: Alright, I'll get out my check book. [Ticked off] Mehh..
       Lawyer: What was that?
Kent Brockman: Mehh, I said "meh".

% Marge gives it a shot.

Marge: So you kids really love the leader, huh? Even more than your parents?
 Kids: [Various "yes"'s, such as "of course" and "at least twice as much"]
Marge: Alright already!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% Marge asks them if they love the leader more than... their brand new hover
% bikes! The kids are amazed. What seems to be bikes hovering a foot or so
% from the ground are making a hovering noise, and the kids are convinced.

Marge: What do you have to say about the leader now, huh?
 Kids: [Things like "what Leader?"]
Marge: And who do you love now?
 Kids: Hoverbikes!
Marge: Close enough.
       [The kids jump onto the hoverbikes, but they come crashing to the
       ground.]
Marge: [laughs] Sorry, kids! There's the no such thing as hoverbikes! They're
       just a couple of huffies on a fishing line!
 Lisa: But we heard them hovering!
       [Ned comes through the door.]
  Ned: I'm afraid I played a dirty part in this little charade.
       [He holds up a comb and paper, and blows into it making the hovering
       noise.]
 Bart: Can we at least keep the bikes?
Marge: Oh no, no-no, no-no-no, they're due back at the store by six, get off
       'em, get off, off, get off!

% Groundskeeper Willie starts Homer's deprogramming.

Groundskeeper Willie: Alright, what's so fine and great about your fancy
                      pants leader?
               Homer: The Leader knows all and sees all!
Groundskeeper Willie: Ooh.. well that <is> impressive!
               Homer: And he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet!
Groundskeeper Willie: Oh! This Leader, he sounds like a grand fella!
               Marge: Willie, I'm not sure we're making any headway here.
Groundskeeper Willie: Would you shut up, woman! He's talking about my leader!

% Flanders offers everyone a beer. Homer's brain tells him to resist, but his
% stomach urges him to drink some.

Go on, Homer. Our commandments clearly state that beer is alright. Try some!
-- Reverend Lovejoy, "The Joy of Sect"

% A small drop manages to land on Homer's tongue, just before the lawyers
% break in and smash the glass of beer on the floor. They grab Homer and
% begin to make their exit. Homer still seems to be under the influence of
% the leader -- he apparently <wants> to go.

[Angry] You know, I pride myself on being a good host, so I'm obliged to
offer you a beer, but I'm so darn mad, it's going to be mostly head!
-- Ned Flanders, "The Joy of Sect"

% Homer is whisked away.

Marge: Homer, come back! That's my husband!
  Guy: He's <our> husband, now.
-- Whatever peels your banana, "The Joy of Sect"

% Homer is returned to the agricultural compound, where a crowd of his fellow
% Movementarians cheer at the sight of his return. Homer stands up at the
% entrance to the forbidden barn in front of everybody.

           Homer: I'm glad I'm back, because the moment that sweet, sweet
                  beer hit my tongue, I was born again!
           Marge: [Gasp]
Reverend Lovejoy: Hallelujah!
           Homer: Now I can show all of you what I've come to realise! The
                  reason we're not allowed in the forbidden barn is because
                  there is no intergalactic spaceship! He's taken our money
                  just so he can--
                  [Homer opens the barn, revealing a huge flying saucer-type
                  intergalactic spaceship.]
                  -- build.. one hell of a spaceship!
-- "The Joy of Sect"

       [The spaceship takes to the air.]
Voice: Homer Simpson. Because of your lack of faith, you have ruined
       mankind's chance for salvation.
Homer: Oops.
-- Not again... "The Joy of Sect"

% Perhaps the Movementarians were telling the truth?

Oh mercy, he's the real deal! [takes his collar off, throws it to the ground
and starts stomping it down.]
-- Reverend Lovejoy, at the sight of the Leader in his intergalactic
   spaceship, "The Joy of Sect"

% Or perhaps not. The spaceship falls apart within moments of taking to the
% air, and underneath all the fancy machinary is the Leader peddling to
% make propellors go round, keeping him in the air. Oh, and the hovering
% noise -- a comb and paper.  The leader loses control above Cletus' house.

Cletus: [Pointing shotgun] Stranger, you're trespassin' on m'ah dirt farm.
Leader: Uh, do you happen to need a messiah?
Cletus: No, but I'll take them sacks o' money from ye.
Leader: Ohh... I should have stayed with the Promise Keepers.
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% Back at the compound, everyone has realised the Leader is a phony.

   Moe: Dammit! It fell apart like everything else I've ever believed in!
        Ahh, I guess it's back to good old fashioned voodoo.
        [He gets a voodoo doll of Barney, and pokes a small Duff bottle
        into it's stomach.]
Barney: Woah, I need a drink!
   Moe: Come with me.
-- "The Joy of Sect"

% Ned spots Lovejoy's collar on the floor, and Lovejoy quickly picks it up.

Come back to poppa, baby.
-- Reverend Lovejoy gets his collar back, "The Joy of Sect"

% Back at the Simpsons home, everything is back to normal. The family are
% watching TV together.

Homer: Just think. I turned to a cult for mindless happiness when I had beer
       all along.
Marge: Hmmm!
Homer: And you, Marge!  The bringer of beer!
-- That's better. Wait... "The Joy of Sect"

Lisa: It's wonderful to think for ourselves again.
Bart: You said it, sister!
  TV: You are watching Fox.
 All: [Zombie-like] We are watching Fox.
-- "The Joy of Sect"
