Blackboard :- `I will not sell school / property'.
              `I will not sell schoo' at cutoff.

Driveway   :- no oil on the driveway.
              Homer does not shake his fist at Bart.

> Didja notice...
===============================================================================

  ... Tracey Ullman provided the voice of the obedience trainer,
      Miss Winthrop?
  ... the Nev-R-Break dog collar that broke?
  ... While Sylvia Winfield is on the phone, Santa's Little Helper gets
      out of the pool, shakes himself dry, then jumps back in?
  ... at work, Homer kept his feet over the monitors?
  ... the studly way Marge threads a needle?
  ... the ad campaign for the sneaker was `Assasins:  Join the Conspiracy'?
  ... Homer's vanity sneaker license plate reads... `Homer'?
      (Ned's was `Ned'.)
  ... the camera angle from inside Lisa's mouth at the doctor's office?
      [Let's see you do <that> with human actors!]
  ... the Killer Babysitter on the news?
  ... Krusty the Klown is on the Joe Franklin Show?
  ... Nancy Cartwright provided the voice of the Big Cookie girl?
  ... not only did Homer say `macamadamia', but he also spelled it that
      way on his note?  (It also took him ten minutes write the note.
      He started at 8:55 and ended at 9:05.)
  ... Miss Winthrop was reading `JOCO', the Journal of Canine Obedience?

  ... the original airing was cut to make room for `Deep Deep Trouble'?

Dave Hall (dave@sys6626.bison.mb.ca) also points out:
  ... the `NEW-R-BREAK' dog collar cost 89 cents.
  ... the red light flashing on the console behind Homer.
  ... Jacques has also enrolled his poodle at Canine College.
  ... There appears to be a "Itchy" (or is it Scratchy?) painting above the
      fireplace in the T.V. soap scene.
  ... when Homer shows off his `Assassin' sneakers, there appears to be a
      hyphen separating the `A'. (Think about it.)
  ... when Homer brings his `Assassins' back, a man in the background, under
      the `Kick Boxing' sign", gives a karate kick to another man.  Note the
      next sign says: `Street Crime'.
  ... the Salesperson sort of reminds me of Side-Show Bob, or that guy from
      `Eraser Head'.
  ... the dog buyer does something with his left hand that causes SLH to yelp.

    Nice allusion to the Dead (and, of course, Robert Crumb) there.

Corby Page (spike@moriah.cs.dartmouth.edu) notes that Marge refers to it as
the Bouvier Family Quilt, which doesn't make sense because it is passed down
through the women of each generation.

> Is Dr. Hibert Dr. Huxtable?

Dr.H's kitchen is the same as Dr.H's kitchen.
He was wearing a Cosby sweater.

And, to rub it in, the next commercial break when the episode was first
aired was a Jell-O commercial with the man himself.

Bart:           Is my dog dead, Ma'am?
Miss Winthrop:  Ah ha ha, you don't know how often I'm asked that.

Look Mom, I've finished my patch.
It depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life.
[cough cough]
On the left is Mr. Largo, my music teacher at school?
He taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of
its beauty and soul.
And on the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy.
He taught me that music is a fire in your belly that comes out
of your mouth, so you better stick an instrument in front of it.

% The family meeting continues...

Lisa:  I'm sure Mom agrees with me.

Homer: You do?  [taunting and dancing]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
-- what to do about Santa's Little Helper? ``Bart's Dog Gets a F''

Lisa:  This is our pet.  We can question his integrity and disposition,
       but we can't question his heart.  Are you trying to teach us that the
       way to solve a problem with something we love is to throw it away?
Homer: [weeping] Oh, Lisa.  If they're ever going to pull the plug on me,
       I want you in my corner, honey.

% Marge says the pet can stay if and only if he passes Obedience School.

Um, take a walk.  Sniff that other dog's butt.
See?  He does exactly what I tell him.
-- Bart trying to demonstrate his control over the dog,
   ``Bart's Dog Get an F''

% Homer hardsells SLH to a guy on the phone.  Back at school, SLH is unable
% to restrain himself from consuming a Beef Wellington.  A potential customer
% comes by to inspect SLH.  Bart fails to talk Miss Winthrop into letting
% SLH pass, and balks at using the choke chain with the level of force that
% Miss Winthrop prescribes.  Lisa begins a new family quilt, its first panel
% depicting the destruction of the old one.  Bart despairs of training SLH,
% and Lisa suggests they spend their last few hours together in play.  In a
% Lassie-style miracle, this bonding experience breaks down the
% communication barrier between Bart and SLH.  Bart successfully trains SLH.
