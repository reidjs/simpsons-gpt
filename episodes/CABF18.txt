> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [tvguide.com] Julia Louis-Dreyfus is the voice of Gloria, a comely cop who
   catches the eye of Mr. Burns in this madcap romance. Thanks to a fortune
   cookie (written by Homer) that says he'll find true love on a particular
   day, Mr. Burns sets out for a night of "womanizing," much to Smithers'
   dismay.  He eventually meets Gloria, who agrees to a date but ultimately
   finds the tycoon too old.  Burns allays her fears by drafting Homer to
   testify to his youthful rowdiness.  The courtship commences, assisted by
   Homer -- and a vial of a "rare and powerful" physical stimulant. When Mr.
   Burns pops the question, a charmed Gloria accepts.  But not everyone is
   happy for the couple.  {sb}

                FUN DOES NOT HAVE         at cutoff

Couch:          The couch and TV are set up by a prison wall.  A searchlight
                pans left and right across the scene.  The family burrows
                under the ground towards the couch, leaving "tunnel mounds" in
                their wake.  They pop out of the ground, wearing striped
                prison uniforms, and jump onto the couch.  Shortly afterwards,
                the searchlight finds and locks onto the family.  [Recycled
                from CABF12]

Matthew Anscher:
   ... the color seems to have returned to Woody Allen's face, as compared to
       his last "appearance" in [BABF19]?
   ... all of Mr. Burns' so-called "wild man" schemes actually happened on
       screen?
   ... either Cletus has had reconstructive surgery on his fingers since
       [CABF14], or the animators forgot he had fingers missing?
   ... the scant three-day period between former guest star George Harrison's
       death and a tribute to him on screen?

Don Del Grande:
   ... at the restaurant, there's no place setting for Maggie?
   ... apparently everybody (except possibly Maggie) knows how to use
       chopsticks, although two spoons were on the table as well?
   ... the second fortune writer sounds like Khan from "King Of The Hill"?
   ... Burns got the name "Pennybags" right?  ("Uncle Pennybags" really is the

   ... apparently Marge's mother doesn't have her original hair and teeth?
   ... judging from the large sign, Stu's Disco DOES advertise?
   ... one of the bowling trophies was a bowler on top of a bottle of Duff?
   ... the bowling alley had the video games Time Waster, Pong 95, and Nuke
       Canada?
   ... bowling at Barney's New Bowlarama is still $1.75 a game, three games
       for $5, or $5 an hour?
   ... Eddie gets shot?  (Is this the first time one of the cops is actually
       shot by somebody?)
   ... Marcia Mitzman-Gaven now includes a hyphen in her name? (Presumably so
       people know to alphabetize it under M)

Alex Foley:
   ... Moe has an American flag?
   ... Smithers was not around during Burns's courtship of Gloria?
   ... Barney's Bowl-A-Rama has Pong?

Tony Hill:
   ... the Toys L Us store?  [See "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]
   ... Burns can remember Homer?

Darrel Jones:
   ... how Seinfeldian this episode was?  (Appropriate, considering the guest
       star.)

Joe Klemm:
   ... the Picasso portrait of Burns as Homer carries him and Gloria up the
       stairs?
   ... a supermarket candy/toy dispenser among the items in Snake's hideout?

   ... the last name "Collins" is used twice?  (Thomas/Joan)
   ... Smithers rolls his eyes at Monty's "lift my wiper" quip?
   ... Maggie removes her pacifier when Marge brings the food to the table?
   ... the dog at the amusement park (that Monty sees) and the dog that Homer
       chases are one and the same?
   ... Monty can play a musical instrument, presumably similar to a piano?
   ... Snake knows the word "trilobite"?  (He had some "student loan payments"
       in the past ... possibly an archaeology student)
   ... Burns calls Homer his best friend?
   ... Snake considers "gravel and dirt" a lawn?
   ... both Snake and Burns use the word "totally"?
   ... the bong on Snake's shelf?
   ... the surfboard against Snake's wall? ("totally" explains the surfer
       talk, dude)
   ... the Star Trek-like wetsuit on Snake's couch?
   ... the barrel with the radioactive symbol on it on Snake's floor?
   ... Lou wears his police cap backwards?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... even Maggie grabs a fortune cookie?
   ... the socialite Monty woos must be a divorcée, since she had a husband in
       "Children of a Lesser Clod (CABF16)"?
   ... we don't learn Gloria's name until Snake says it toward the end of the
       show?
   ... Homer's backside is still scorched from the fire when he and the family
       walk into the sunset?

Ted Schuerzinger:
   ... Chinatown is apparently in an entirely different part of Springfield
       from Ethnictown?  (Then again, Ethnictown *did* appear in the non-
       canonical THOH XII.)
   ... Flanders didn't seem disturbed by Homer and Marge's apparently loud
       sex?
   ... the "Nuke Canada" video game at the bowling alley?

Amir Vardi:
   ... Gloria, a cop, went out with Snake, a criminal?

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Stephen Burks:  I guess it all kinda boils down to what makes a good Simpsons
   episode.  Some people like it when Homer does all kinds of Zany things,
   some people like references to pop culture and the like, some people like
   subplots, some people want one concise story, etc.  Well, tonight's episode
   had a clear coherent storyline that lasted the entire show, but there was
   very little (if not any) or any of the other stuff that makes a Simpsons
   episode good in the eyes of many of its fans.  It seems as though that is a
   step in the right direction, but I don't think that the show should be on
   valium.  I can only really summarize this in [...] an old Burns line:  "You
   know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate.  And ... I don't hate
   this."  (B)

Don Del Grande:  one of the best this season, although it rates a "low"
   A-minus because of the copout ending ("Monty, you're my hero, I know I said
   I'd marry you, and that Snake is a woman-beating low life, oh who am I
   kidding, Monty who?").  "Swartzenegger" is back with this one.  (A-)

Alex Foley:  Huge improvement over the last two episodes.  The first two acts
   featured a lot of great gags (such as the dragon, Homer trying out Burns
   sexual stimulant, Burns cheerfully firing Carl).  The show does lose it's
   footing  once Snake takes Homer & Gloria hostage (though I LOL'ed at
   Homer's "mmm ... pistol whip" line).  Overall John Swartzwelder's best
   episode in a few years.  (B-)

Joe Green:  One of the more enjoyable Season 13 episodes so far, even though
   Swartzwelder got bogged down in cliched plot elements.  I'll say this much:
   it was one of those rare eps that actually made me sympathize with Mr.
   Burns.  (Just why is it that women are so self-defeatingly attracted to
   "bad boys"?  The world may never know ...)  (B)

Tony Hill:  This episode had promise, but in the end it wasn't there.  Why was
   Gloria only a cop in the first scene?  Shouldn't the others have recognized
   her at least?  The dedication to George Harrison was nice.  I give it a
   (C)

Darrel Jones:  Maybe it was because I was surfing the Net while watching it,
   but I didn't enjoy this one.  Nothing was bad about it, though not much was
   good, either.  Homer's "Pistol Whip" fantasy was good, though.  I give it a
   C+ (6/10) for effort.  (C+)

Anthony Kusich:  Finally, the first laugh-out-loud episode of the season!
   After a spotty Halloween special and two unfunny episodes that had me
   almost wincing at the screen, "Hunka Hunka" reminded me of the Simpsons of
   old.  The fortune cookie intro segued into the rest of the episode nicely,
   and Homer was up to his usually hysterical self ("That dog has my gum!").
   I hope the rest of season 13 is like this.  (A-)

Andrew J. Milner:  A distinct improvement over the season's earlier episodes.
   Nice to see Homer be a little dumb without being repellent ly stupid, a few
   very good sight gags ("TOYS 'L' US") and it's always good to see Burns'
   character fleshed out.  Wish they'd developed the whole fortune-cookie
   subplot further into the storyline, though.  (B)

Ted Schuerzinger:  Surprisingly good, considering it's a CABF episode and
   presumably a hold- over from Season 12.  Homer didn't seem like too much of
   a Jerk*ss -- after all, everybody complained about the odd fortunes in
   their fortune cookies, and this is the sort of thing I could see people
   commenting upon.  The satire on the 24-hour news networks (Kent Brockman
   arriving at "Minute 2" of the hostage situation, and the "Insta-Poll" which
   is all that seems to pass for "news" these days") was understated but on
   target, and Homer and Marge's implied sex scene had me laughing out loud!
   I'd give this episode a B+; one of the better episodes in quite a long
   time, with the exception of "Trilogy of Error".  (B+)

Todd Willis:  Very nice episode!  Finally, we get a coherent plot for the
   first time in a long time.  It was nice to see a lot of Mr. Burns, which
   hasn't happened recently.  The first two acts were solid, but the final act
   suffer by an overkill of Snake's appearance.  Not the best episode ever,
   but one of the best in a long time.  (B+)

Yours Truly:  It takes a while to hit its stride, but this episode does build
   both momentum and laughs.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a good run on the show,
   playing a funny character not that far removed from "Seinfeld's" Elaine.
   Homer and Burns team up to good effect, and for once the third act doesn't
   peter out.  Toss in some good moments (Smithers' attempted flirtation with
   Burns, and the aphrodisiac scene stand out), and "Hunka Hunka" shapes up to
   be a good episode.  (B+)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B (2.94)   Std Dev.: 0.5619   (12 reviews computed)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Those Eternal Threads

 - Where is Springfield?

Tony Hill:  If the Chinese New Year parade really took place in February,
   there was no snow on the ground, suggesting a more southerly locale.


 - Is Smithers gay?

Benjamin Robinson:  When Burns reads that he will find true love on Flag Day,
   Smithers immediately suggests that it is he and Burns who will be lovers.


Tony Hill:  Smithers moans in *agony* when female strippers shake their butts
   at him.


>> Meta-Reference corner

Tony Hill, man of few words, writes:  Burns thinks everything is excellent.


>> Musical References

And NRBQ fan going by the moniker "InMyPants102" notes the song playing during
   the Burns-Gloria dating montage was, "If I Don't Have You."


>> Perhaps if "fun size" were larger ...

Chad Lehman wonders:  Reading the chalkboard gag, I always ask myself: what
   did Bart do to get that punishment?  Apparently, Edna is getting liberal in
   her detention-giving ... Bart brings an offensive candy bar to class!  ;)


>> Toys "L" Us

Joe Klemm:  The Toys 'L' Us is a reference to Japanese language.  While
   Americans have different sounds for R and L, there is no distinction
   between the sounds of R and L in the Japanese language.  Thus, it is
   sometimes common that some Japanese names can be spelled either with an R
   or an L.


Surly Duff asks:  Wouldn't it be Chinese, since they were in Chinatown?


Richard Kim answers:  The L and R similarities are present in Asian languages
   like Chinese, Korean or Japanese


Dr. Steve:  Didn't anyone notice that this is sort of racist?  I really don't
   care most of the time, but as far as I know this is a reference to when
   Asian people that have just learned English have problems with words that
   have an R in them ... they pronounce it as an L ...

   As said before, this is because R and L have the same sound in Malay, but
   this was also a pretty bad ethnic slur/stereotype from a long time ago when
   Americans made fun of Asian people like, 40-50 years ago.


Chad Lehman:  IMO this is why P.C. is so distressing.  The Simpsons has
   lampooned P.C. subjects from time to time, and P.C. itself.  We recognize
   the reference, and laugh because it comes from our world.  Does this mean
   we'll come away from the episode with a determination to treat Asian people
   worse?  Is the joke a good excuse to openly mock a group of people when we
   get the chance?  Is this reference a precursor to hate? IMO absolutely not.
   It's ridiculous.  Thinking people with good hearts would treat everyone
   kindly, but laugh at the ridiculous stereotypes lampooned on The Simpsons.


>> Alligator in the toilet?  Grab a plunger, Grampa

Chad Lehman:  Flushing things down the toilet results in huge, deformed,
   sewer-living mutants.  Ranks right up there with "keep digging, and you'll
   reach China" and "keep doing that, and you'll go blind."


>> It's like Valentine's Day, but with more flags

Joe Green:  Given the references to Flag Day (which is on June 14, for you
   non-Americans), this episode was clearly meant to take place in June.
   Could this show have been rescheduled from broadcast in some other part of
   the year?  (Contrast this with [AABF05], whose original broadcast date was
   during Ramadan.)


About the holiday itself, Benjamin Robinson writes:  In the United States,
   Flag Day falls on June 14th.  If you own a U.S. flag (and a lot more of us
   do nowadays), you're supposed to fly it on this day.  Flag Day is a minor
   holiday; you don't get off work, schools and banks remain open, and even
   the greeting card companies don't make Flag Day cards.


>> Is it Flag Day already?

Hey, speaking of Flag Day, Don Del Grande wrote:  There are (at least) two
   explanations for showing Flag Day soon after the Chinese New Year parade.
   First, not every city has its parade right on Chinese New Year (San
   Francisco, for example).  Second, it's possible that months passed by
   between when Homer started writing the fortunes and the scene with Mr.
   Burns opening the cookie.


Bucky Jones has a third explanation:  They [the Simpson family] see that big
   dragon creature that looks like something that would be in a parade, and
   Marge says, "Ohh, it must be Chinese New Year's."  Then we find out that it
   really is a big dragon, meaning that it is not part of a parade, meaning
   that Marge's assumption was wrong.


David Werner:  Besides, Lisa probably knows what day Chinese New Years was,
   and would have said something like "It's the year of the dragon" after
   hearing Marge's remark, had it actually been the Chinese New Years.  And
   yes, I know that the year of the dragon was last year, not this year.  Then
   there's the question of where the big dragon came from to begin with ...
   I'll say a wizard did it.


>> Parlez-vous Chinese?

A couple of viewers pointed out that, since Homer was writing the fortunes in
   English, Lisa didn't have to puzzle out what the ideograms on a Chinese
   keyboard meant.


Chad Lehman:  Fortunes can have both the English and the Chinese on them.
   With all the Chinese-born people in Chinatown, would the clientele be
   strictly English-speaking?  You'd think Homer and Lisa would have to at
   least make both English and Chinese versions.


Benjamin Robinson:  Do native Chinese (and recent immigrants) eat fortune
   cookies, or is this mainly a Western convention?  [Zan Hecht answers,
   "Actually, fortune cookies are a strictly American invention.  They were
   invented in San Francisco, IIRC." -- Ed.]  I know the menu at most American
   Chinese food restaurants is subtly different that what you'd find in China.
   There might not be as much demand for Chinese-language fortunes in that
   case.

   (Of course, if the fortunes needed to be in both languages, Homer could
   just compose them in English, and then have them sent out for translation.
   But that wouldn't have been as funny.)


>> Hunka Hunka Car Watch

Benjamin Robinson:  Gloria's ride is a Ford Thunderbird, circa 1958-1960.  The
   headlight and taillight details are a little off, but the car is still
   recognizable.  Pretty nice ride for someone on a parking cop's salary --
   maybe Snake stole it for her before he got sent up the river.

   It must have been Old Ford Day on the show -- Snake walked past not one but
   two 1957 Ford sedans.  (Or rather, the same sedan twice since the
   background was recycled.)

   Burns says that the car seen in this episode is a "Bugatti Sexarossa." As
   you might suspect, Bugatti never made a car by that name. Moreover, the car
   we see doesn't resemble any Bugatti that I know of. It does make sense that
   Burns would have a Bugatti in his garage, though.  In their day, Bugattis
   were exclusive motor cars aimed at the very upper crust.  Today, the cars
   can fetch six or even seven figures at auction.


Joe Green adds:  One of the cars in the Barney's Bowl-A-Rama parking strongly
   resembles a Volvo 870.


>> The Burns Uncertainty Principle, explained

As noted in the Goof section, Burns can inject himself with a syringe, even
   though doctors at the Mayo clinic could not.  Obviously, this is just a
   consistency goof, but it inspired some interesting reconciliation attempts.


Matt Drury:  Yes: if you want something done right, you have to do it
   yourself.  An appropriate Burnsian philosophy, supported by recent advances
   in quantum mechanics and metaphysics.


Brian Beck:  Going into more depth, using the Burns uncertainty principle --
   if another person measures his arm, then it changes the position of the
   arm, this making it impossible to stick with a needle.  However, because
   Burns knows everything about himself, he is able to find the arm to stick a
   syringe in it, and Homer is too dumb to know what a measurement is to screw
   it up.


Rory Molinari writes:  A syringe worked fine in the X-Files episode, when
   Burns was hopped up on goofballs.  Perhaps it is only syringes in Minnesota
   that fail.


>> Marge is "sexist" ... hee hee!  He said a bad word!

Chad Lehman:  Marge can't stand seeing a MAN single ... have the years of
   waiting and expecting her sisters to "do something with their lives" worn
   Marge down on the women-married issue?


>> No man is an island.  No woman, either

While we're on this topic, Benjamin Robinson writes:  Marge insists everybody
   should be "paired up," while Lisa is equally convinced that some people are
   happiest when alone. Maybe I'm reading too much into the conversation, but
   I get the idea that later in life, Marge will be pestering Lisa to get
   married, whether Lisa wants to or not.


Chad Lehman asks:  Did Marge pair Maggie and the cactus for their "spikiness"?


>> Opposites Attract

David N. Werner:  By the way, the  whole "cop and criminal in love" bit can be
   explained by Stockholm Syndrome, a phenomenon in which a hostage falls in
   love with the captor.  Snake probably has done this before ... or maybe the
   writers just forgot she was a cop.


Elson writes:  Hmm ... was she a cop, or just a meter maid?  It's only in big
   cities that the Police Dept and Parking Enforcement are different entities.


Tony Hill:  Meter monitors don't work at 11:59 PM where I live.


>> They may rule the Earth, but they're not good dating material

Joe Green writes:  When Snake calls Burns a "trilobite", this is a reference
   to a prehistoric creature from over 300 million years ago.  You can find
   out more about this species at http://www.aloha.net/~smgon/trilobite.htm .


Benjamin Robinson:  [They] are small creatures that lived in the oceans by the
   untold millions, *before* the age of the dinosaurs.  They were oblong-
   shaped, had a hard shell, and lots of little shrimp- or lobster-like legs.
   The trilobites mysteriously died out long ago, and their fossils are a
   common find today.  I'm impressed that Snake knows about them.


>> Why we need copyright lawyers

Kevin Muckenthaler found some interesting coincidences:  Last night's episode
   seemed very similar to the episode Dumbbell Indemnity

   - Both episodes have unappealing men (Moe and Burns) looking for love.

   - Both men are about to give up when they meet a beautiful women with the
   voice of a guest star.

   - Moe and Burns both use Homer to help them.

   - Both episodes contain scenes of the couple going out with a musical
   backdrop.

   - Both episodes include a disco scene.

   - In both episodes, everything seems to be working out (Hawaii and
   marriage) when something bad happens (Moe tells Renee about using Homer to
   steal the car/Snake kidnaps Gloria).

   - Both episodes contain the Springfield police and an arrest being made
   (Homer and Snake).

   - Homer gets into trouble in both episodes (arrested and taken as a
   hostage).

   - Both episodes include a burning building (Moe's bar and Snake's house).

   - Both episodes have a gag about carrying somebody out of a burning
   building (Barney with the beer kegs and Gloria carrying Burns).

   - Both women leave the men at the end.

   - Snake's even in both episodes (he's trying to steal Moe's car).


>> Does this guy have a newsletter I can subscribe to?

Tongue (presumably) in cheek, Punkass Crab writes:  CABF18 contained an
   obscure criticism of the legitimacy of the Bush administration.  As it has
   become increasingly dangerous to criticize Bush, it is understandable that
   the writers would choose a cryptic yet unmistakable reference to election
   fraud.

   Let's examine the reference.  The love story that ultimately matters in
   this episode is that of Gloria and Snake (and yes, the characters
   themselves were the inspiration for this love story).  Now, with a bit of
   West Texas drawl, "Gloria-Snake" becomes "Glorious Neck", or the
   description of Shrikantha, one of the many names of Shiva.  Shiva, in fact,
   has 108 names.  The 108th Simpsons episode aired was Sideshow Bob Roberts
   (2F02) in which Bart and Lisa expose the election fraud that carried
   Sideshow Bob into office.

   Foreshadowing of this reference was achieved when Apu said, "Shiva H.
   Vishnu!" in Bart the Fink (3F12).  "H", of course, is the middle initial
   that separates George Herbert Walker Bush from George Walker Bush.  The
   former was legitimately elected, while the latter, the writers would
   insist, was not. That's an "H" of legitimacy.  In that episode, Bart
   reveals more dirty dealings (financial, this time), such that Krusty
   decides to fake his own death.  Of course, just as George W. Bush was
   mysteriously AWOL from his Air National Guard airplane, Krusty is not in
   his airplane when it explodes.  The Apu quote was in fitting response to
   seeing Krusty in his airplane.


>> Coming Attractions

user54165 asks:  In the previews, Burns tells Homer that he'll "take it from
   here" as Homer carries them upstairs.  Was this in the episode?  I don't
   remember that part.


Gary A answers:  I think that it was a audio splice -- Burns says he'll take
   it from there when he's sitting in the chair.  When they're still climbing,
   Burns tells Homer to go left up ahead.  Similarly, the bit where they're in
   the bar and Homer has to put Burns' hand on "'my' 'knee'" was definitely
   compressed for the commercial (almost no pauses between lines).


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Joe Green alterna-title for this episode is:  Queen of Burns' Castle


Anthony Kuisch:  The episode received an 8.2/13 [rating] (13.2 million
   viewers).


Chad Lehman:  "This is the happiest day of my life. Nothing could spoil it ...
   ABSOLUTELY NOTHING."  This line could make someone coin the term "anti-
   foreshadowing".


Benjamin Robinson:  Rudolph Valentino was the Mel Gibson of the silent film
   era, a handsome leading man who made ladies' hearts flutter.


>> RIP, George Harrison

Don Del Grande:  Dedicated to the memory of A PLATE OF BROWNIES - er, uh,
   GEORGE HARRISON


Benjamin Robinson:  As speculated, tonight's episode was dedicated to George
   Harrison, the musician and ex-Beatle who passed away late last week.  In my
   opinion, he got a better dedication episode than did Linda McCartney
   ("Trash of the Titans (5F09)").

-- "A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love"

% Snake still pleads his case with Gloria.

Snake:	I swear I can change, Gloria.  I'm taking classes in 
	computer fraud.
Gloria:	That's what you said about the telemarketing scam.  But 
	you didn't stick with it.
Snake:	I don't like bothering people at home.
-- And now that they have that do-not-call list ..., "A Hunka Hunka
   Burns in Love"

% While Snake and Gloria argue, Homer sidles the chair up to a wood
% burning stove, and tries to use the heat to burn through the ropes. 
% It works!  The only problem is, Homer's clothes are on fire, too. 
% He jumps up, and hops around the room with the burning chair still
% strapped to his back.  Eventually, he falls down, and the chair
% breaks apart.  Flaming pieces of the chair land on the stolen
% merchandise Snake has stored in the cabin.  Soon, the whole place is
% aflame.  Both Snake and Homer rush out the front door and fall on
% the grass.  Unfortunately, Gloria is trapped inside.

Burns:	My Gloria's still inside!  Save her!
	[the porch on the cabin collapses]
Wiggum:	It's too dangerous!  But I got a sister you might like.  
	She's completely hairless, like those cats.
Burns:	I don't care if she's Miss Hairless America, I'm spoken 
	for.  Now, step aside.  I'll save Gloria myself.
Wiggum:	You?  Uh, no offense, but you're a decrepit monkey 
	skeleton.
Burns:	Perhaps, but this monkey skeleton is in love!
-- "A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love"

% Burns runs to the cabin to save his girlfriend, but can't push aside
% the timbers of the collapsed porch roof.  Just as he admits to
% himself he's just a "feeble old man," he sees Gloria stirring in the
% cabin.  With his resolve strengthened, he forces his way into the
% burning building.
%
% Soon, the shadowy figure of one person carrying another to safety
% appears at the front door.  It looks as though Mr. Burns has rescued
% Gloria.  Lisa is impressed with his heroism.  When the figures step
% into clear view, we see that it is Gloria who is carrying Mr. Burns. 
% "Well, the important thing is, they're both safe," says Lisa.
%
% Gloria rests Mr. Burns on the ground.  Kent walks her over in front
% of the cabin.

I know you've been through a lot, ma'am, but we need you to stand in 
front of the burning house and say, "Channel 6 News is hot, hot, 
hot!"
-- Kent Brockman, "A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love"

% Homer is still impressed with Burns's rescue attempt.

Homer:	Wow, Mr. Burns, how did you do that?
Burns:	Never forget, Homer, there's no muscle stronger than the 
	human heart.
Homer:	What about the wiener?  A guy on TV lifted a can of paint 
with his.
-- "A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love"

% Gloria runs up to Mr. Burns as the police put snake in the back of a
% cruiser.

Gloria:	Oh, Monty, you saved me!  And to think I was once in love 
	with that dirty low-life, with his arrogant smirk, gutter 
	mouth, tough-guy attitude, macho tattoos, hair that can't 
	be tamed, [sighs] prison-sculpted body ...
Marge:	Uh, oh.
Gloria:	I'm sorry, Monty.  [kisses him goodbye, and leaves] Oh, 
	Snake, don't ever change.
-- "A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love"

% Burns splutters a bit after Gloria runs to join Snake.  The Simpson
% family walks over to comfort Mr. Burns, and they walk into the
% sunset together.

Burns:	I don't get it, Simpson.  I'm a bad boy.
Homer:	Oh, I know.
Burns:	I'm absolutely evil.
Bart:	You're preaching to the choir, man.
Burns:	What do I have to do, grow a devil beard?
Marge:	Devil beard?
Burns:	You know, a little goatee thing.
Homer:	You mean a Van Dyke?
Burns:	No, a Van Dyke has a moustache, doesn't it?
Lisa:	I think it can.
Bart:	Are you talking about a soul patch?
Burns:	No!  Wait, maybe.

% [End of Act Three.  Time:  20:21]
%
% George Harrison, both a former Beatle and "Simpsons" guest voice,
% passed away shortly before it first aired in North America.  The
% producers dedicated this episode to him, briefly showing a still
% picture of Homer and Harrison from "Homer's Barbershop Quartet
% (9F21)."  Otherwise, there's no change to closing credits.  The
% Gracie Noise is the normal "Shhh," too.
