> "TV Guide" Synopsis  {jmb}
==============================================================================
   The Simpsons make friends with a kitsch collector.  But the fact that
   he's gay makes Homer fearful of his potential influence on Bart.

==============================================================================
> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Couch      :- On a MacIntosh computer screen, an empty couch lies within
              an "America Onlink" window.  The pointer is dragged and
              clicked on "Load Family", which starts downloading
              artwork.  "Please wait..." instructs the program, as the
              first item out of five is fetched.  The Simpsons theme
              stays on hold as the process bar fills up at snail pace.
              The pointer is then dragged on "Exit", with several
              frustrated clicks, to no avail.

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
   [Due to the highly controversial nature of this episode, I decided to
   forgo any space contraint, and include every publishable review that
   was submitted. --ed]

Dale G. Abersold:  I may not know good social satire, but I do know what
   makes me laugh my butt off, and that's what "Homer's Phobia" did for
   me. I thought Homer's reaction to homosexuality was well within
   character: he was bumbling and ignorant, but not malicious. The only
   jarring note for me was presenting the Simpson family as a "camp"
   artifact: aren't they just the "average nuclear-age family"?  (A-)

Greg Bigoni:  Well, I have to admit that it unnerved me a bit to see
   Homer being such a jerk, but his raves were much funnier when I
   watched the show for a second time on videotape. His attitude was
   also nicely balanced out by the rest of the family. One of my
   favorite things about this show was that Lisa was gentle in her
   disagreements with Homer, rather than becoming the annoying, preachy
   Lisa that we've seen before. John Waters was also the best-cast guest
   star the show has featured since Kirk Douglas. Several viewers
   doubtlessly found the show very politically incorrect, but I think
   that's always been the charm of "The Simpsons"... even though the
   ending was a little dumb. "Is it safe to come out, Mr. Gay Man?"
   (A-)

Jennifer M. Blaske:  I was pretty bored during most of this episode,
   especially the second half. It was basically a one-joke show - making
   fun of stereotypes about gays and people's reactions to gays - and
   personally I just don't find that funny, at least not for twenty
   minutes straight. The ending was *very* predictable. This will
   possibly be one, like "Two Bad Neighbors," that I will skip in
   syndication.  (D+)

Jesse Burgheimer:  A funny episode, lots of great gags.  The end seemed
   a little too pat, but I think you need to think about it in terms of
   what Matt Groening said about the end of "Mr. Lisa Goes To
   Washington" -- sometimes pat Simpsons endings are really spoofs of
   typical pat TV endings. The line that completely broke me up was
   "Dad, why did you take me to a gay steel mill?" A hysterical capper
   to a funny scene.  (A-)

Alex Byrnes:  I thought this was one of the funniest episodes this
   season! I also thought that it would be a little offensive to the gay
   community. I thought that the show jumped to quickly from what was
   happenning in acts 1 and 2 to Homer, Moe, and Barney taking Bart
   hunting. I also thought that how John save the group was a little
   hokey, but Bart's line, "It's Santa all right, and he is kicking
   ass!" was funny. The best part of the whole episode was when Bart was
   dancing with that huge, black wig on his head! It was a little
   disjointed but some of the gags saved it (i.e.: the whole steel mill
   scene).  (B+)

Vince Chan:  This is not good. The second episode that has met my
   disapproval this season. (The other is 4F12) This episode was only a
   bit funny, not the material that could make you squirt milk out of
   your nose. What got me the most was that the whole epsiode was all
   just pointless gay bashing! This episode did however, answer the age
   old question, "What is on the Simpsons kitchen curtains?". The
   writers aren't putting as much effort into their work as they use to.
   (C)

Chris Courtois:  "Homer's Phobia" was quite a pleasant surprise. My
   phobia was we'd be subjected to either a 3F03-style PC rant or a
   numbingly obvious "Star Trek" style "message" episode. Instead we got
   something that's been missing for awhile called satire, where the
   points were shown to us instead of spelled out with platitude laden
   speeches. Homer's attempts to straighten out Bart were hilarious in
   their absurdity. And John Waters did a great job, surprising
   considering he's known for being a writer/director and not a actor
   (although he is a great public speaker). There were a few rough
   spots, like the abrupt transitions to talking about John's being gay
   (seemed like they weren't sure how to bring up the message aspect of
   the episode), and the Smithers gag felt tacked on and obligatory. But
   overall, this was one of the more solid and more enjoyable episodes
   of the season.  (A-)

Steve Frayne:  I don't know that this one will go down as one of the
   greatest but it sure was funny. The way Homer reacted to the idea
   that Jon might be gay was terrific as it can be seen in so many
   people today. All the stereotyping was just hilarious and the gay
   steel mill left me dying of laughter.  (B)

Timothy Goddard:  Another encouraging episode.  It was pretty funny, yet
   at the same time rather sad to witness Homer's homophobia, and
   subsequent paranoia concerning Bart's sexual orientation. However,
   Homer did "learn his lesson" in an ending which was, thankfully, not
   terribly preachy.  (B+)

Jason Hancock:  I just did not care for this one.  The couch gag was
   hilarious (and easy to relate to, as a former AOL user), but it was
   all downhill after that. Besides, Homer as a homophobe irritated me.
   This definitely could have used a subplot.  (C)

Ryan Johnson:  Mabey I was giddy again but this was actually a pretty
   solid episode aside from the steel mill tour and party.  The ending
   was a bit weak, but it seemed to work. I notice that the writers are
   taking shots at everyone these days =)  Vegetarians from incest?  It
   was funny, but they'll screw up one of these days and offend a large
   group of people eventually at the rate the rate they're going
   (although I can't speak for gays or steelworkers at this point).  (B)

Margaret Jones:  I found this episode to be humourless, predictable, and
   very disappointing. And how did Marge "know" the gay man's sexual
   orientation just from his interests? At least IMHO, this only served
   to perpetuate the stereotypes our society has about homosexuals. It
   would have been far more plausible for Homer to have found out by the
   man's telling him directly.  (D+)

Mark Kinash:  Very funny.  Although the thing with the reindeer left
   something to be desired. Also, a few too many gay stereotypes.
   Funniest parts included Bart dancing to "In his kiss" and the
   steelworkers "We work hard, we play hard". Ha!  (A)

Joe Klemm:  The episode lacked some scenes that would have spiced the
   episode up. Yet, it had some funny moments like the AOL couch gag and
   the gay steel workers dancing to "Gonna Make You Sweat".  (B)

Haynes Lee:  The best of a mediocre line of 4F episodes. Should also
   prove to be the most controversial episode ever.  (A+)

Ondre Lombard:  "Homer's Phobia" is that controversy Simpsons needs.  It
   was hilarious, care-free fare. Act three was real flat, however, and
   needed a lot of work. I was ROTFL at the Steel Mill scene and Bart in
   that wig. I have to say I haven't laughed so hard at a Simpsons
   episode since 3F22. John was a fun character, and that could never be
   ruined by Homer's homophobia. Still not as good as anything written
   by Jon Vitti in season 4, but good for what the writers are capable
   of in this day and age.  (B)

Blaine Moller:  Good episode. A lot of good gags and a good story line
   made this one a well rounded show. I'm sure some so called simpson
   fans are sitting at home with there VCR's on slo-mo pointing out all
   the flaws as we speak, but despite the critisism this season has
   really been good.  (B+)

Sean O'Neal:  This was indescribably horrible. Just when I was beginning
   to get optimistic from last week's inside joke-themed "Itchy and
   Scratchy and Poochie," along comes an episode full of lame, "In
   Living Color"-style routines about homosexuals. Did Ron Hauge win a
   "Write a Simpsons Episode" contest or something? This was the first
   episode where I've ever hated any character, and here I had three to
   choose from : Homer, in super-doltish Al Bundy mode; Moe, who had
   nothing but lame bile and not one good line; and John Waters, who is
   the last person I would choose to do a voiceover. His "hoo!"s had me
   muting the TV halfway through. Simpsons episodes are about memorable
   lines, and this one had absolutely none. Please, get Ron Hauge a
   writing partner.  (F)

Nate Patrin:  Wow, this one was weird. I mean, weird. It wasn't all the
   gay refs that felt odd ("The Anvil" was still funny, even if it was
   coming from a mile away), but the kitsch-o-rama that pervaded the
   whole thing. But then, I s'pose an ep with John Waters has to be
   kitschy. The pacing was alright, the jokes were not laugh-out-loud
   funny but still amusing- especially the "Clank Clank You're Dead"
   robot and the mushroom cloud cafe, not to mention the couch gag- and
   the flow of the story was pretty good. Not a classic, but I ain't
   taping over it, that's for sure.  (B)

Werner Peeters:  It's always a bit dangerous when they try to include a
   message in an episode, because sometimes they make it too preachy.
   This episode however worked over the whole line: Homer's bigoted
   despise of homosexuals, and the stupid reactions (going out hunting
   with Moe and Barney!) are really in the line of character of Homey!
   Of course the obligatory Smithers is gay-reference was there, and the
   homosexual steel workers had me chacking up!  (A)

Mark Aaron Richey:  I was extremly worried that this episode would turn
   out to be a shrill "message" episode, where most of the humor would
   be knocked aside for the "gays are people, too" message. Granted,
   it's an important lesson far too few people seem to realize
   (political discussion over), but one that I couldn't see successfully
   being intergrated into the show without preaching (the last time they
   tried that was the self-rightous [3F03] "Lisa the Vegetarian"). I
   shouldn't have worried. Homophobia was lampooned mercilessly, and
   there were plenty of laughs to be found. Homer's homophobia, while a
   bit on the extreme side (which was needed for plot purposes), I
   didn't find out of character, and his fears that Bart would turn into
   one of "them" simply by hanging around John seemed exactly like the
   thought process of someone ignorant. Homer managed to redeem himself
   as he hilariously (and painfully) learned his lesson. An excellent
   job by John Waters as John, and one of the best jobs in a while from
   Nancy Cartwright.  (A)

Benjamin J. Robinson:  A curious mix of what I like and what I hate
   about today's "Simpsons" episodes. Some of the characterizations
   (Bart especially) are right on, John Waters has a good guest spot as
   a kitschy store owner, and the premise is the daring sort of material
   "The Simpsons" is known for tackling. Homer's over-the-top reaction
   blunts much of the promise the episode has, though, and the last two
   acts aren't all that funny.  (C+)

Matt Rose:  Another great couch opening (there have been a lot of good
   ones this year) but it was downhill from there. That had to be the
   most annoying Homer has ever been. It was totally out of character
   for him to be that way. "Three simple words: I am gay". Remember
   this? And on top of this there was little to laugh at, except for the
   couch gag and some of Bart's actions and words. And the involvement
   of Smithers was good too.(GET THE MESSAGE YET?) They can't all be
   great.  (C-)

Donni Saphire-Bernstein:  I liked this episode a lot. Although it had
   some irritating minor flaws, the overall flow and nonstop jokes made
   it quite worthwhile. Homer's vocal homophobia did bother me, as he
   has previously (perhaps unwittingly) demonstrated some effeminate
   characteristics himself, but it stitched itself together well in the
   end. Homer's brain appeared to be as homophobic as he was, which is
   somewhat disappointing, seeing as how it has shown better judgement
   than him many times in the past ;). The steelworker bit was
   hilarious. the hawaiin shirt bit was funny. BTW, how come Marge is so
   tolerant now? In past episodes, she's been prudish and ignorant,
   especially in Bart After Dark.  (B)

Liam J. Scanlam:  This was a great episode. "Homer's Phobia" was full of
   heady goodness and John Waters was great. (Although I thought he was
   an old man) The scene at the gay steel mill was a ROTFL, even though
   I sat on the couch during the entire episode and the couch gag was
   funny. It proves Ron Hauge worthy of the Simpsons writing crew and as
   the best. It slightly surpasses "Burns, Baby Burns" as the season
   favorite.  (A+)

Andy Signore:  It's without a doubt an instant classic! Homer is so the
   man, it's not even funny, two words, "Hello? China?". What made this
   episode so great was how smart it was. The little subliminal messages
   (ie: Homer- "Where'd you get that shirt?" Bart - "Out of the
   closet"). It played with the topic of homosexaulity so close to the
   edge, and yet at no point did it make the viewer feel uncomfortable
   like some of the other gay themed shows on TV. This time and so many
   times before, it dealt with a hot topic in our society. They showed
   how we tend to deal with the topic and then rip our way of dealing
   with it to shreads. Whats so amazing is that they did it without
   being preachy. They just showed how idiotic our way of dealing with
   gays is. Hilarious, smart, and somewhat touching, Homer's Phobia is
   easily one of my all time favorites.  (A+)

Aaron Varhola:  The best this season, and one of the better ones of the
   past four. I was a bit leery of Homer's transformation from ignorant
   about gays to homophobic, but a second viewing showed it to be better
   done than I thought. Ron Hauge slipped a lot of nice details into the
   story as well; Bart showed good playfulness in taunting Homer, and
   Marge and Lisa showed the time-tested maxim that the best way to
   attract a woman is to be a flaming homosexual. :) Excellent social
   commentary; Homer dislikes gays, but doesn't know a thing about them,
   and no "moment of sh*t".  (A)

Yours Truly:  When I first watched this episode, it left me disappointed
   to see Homer behave in such a stereotypical way. It was only much
   later, through a second viewing, that I realized how mistaken I was.
   Ultimately, atop of the brilliant gags and one-liners inserted in
   this episode, what would win me was, in fact, Homer's character.
   (Start of Act II notwithstanding.) He was a father trying to protect
   his son, with what little knowledge he had, from what he considered
   could end up hurting both of them; he may have been wrong, but his
   intentions were right. Paradoxically, he was not acting out of hate,
   but out of love, which makes him one of the few two-dimensional
   homophobic characters I have ever seen.  (A-)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Give us a censorship story...

Haynes Lee forwards us a BBC interview with executive producers Josh
   Weinstein & Bill Oakley:

   Usually we can negotiate with the network. We have to say "ok we
   won't have Bart say pissed if you let us say this". And so forth. We
   have one show coming up next year where Homer is forced to confront
   his own homophobia by a character played by the movie director John
   Waters. Homer reacts in a predictably Homer/homophobic way. That show
   had probably the most censor notes of any show we've ever had - two
   solid pages of single spaced notes. We were able to negotiate them
   down to just a few which are probably reasonable, and then we changed
   a few lines. But most of the edge of the show was still there.


>> WebTV without a TV

Jason Hancock:  America Online, or AOL, is the nation's largest Internet
   Service Provider. Before it went to a flat rate last December, it
   charged $2.95 an hour after the first five hours. Unfortunately,
   large chunks of that time can be spent simply downloading "artwork,"
   as the couch gag illustrated -- and large bills can be the result,
   especially if you had a slow modem or were stuck with a slow access
   number. (This was the main reason why I decided to leave AOL at this
   time last year, as my bills reached over $100 a month.) Of course,
   now that AOL has a $19.95 per month flat rate, its main problem has
   been busy signals due to the growing number of members.

Mark Aaron Richey:  America's most popular Internet provider (mainly
   because it's one of the few national Internet providers), AOL offers
   real-time chat and other stuff you can't get on the real Internet
   (the chat rooms are the only special features I remember from my
   brief time on AOL a year and a half ago). The drawback was they
   charged $2.95 per hour. However, in December, they switched to a flat
   monthly fee (like just about every other service provider), only to
   find that nobody could get on anymore, and earning the new nicknames
   "America Onhold" and "America Offline".


>> Writer Watch

Dale G. Abersold:  This is the first episode written by Ron Hauge, who
   has previously written for such Nickelodeon shows as "Ren & Stimpy"
   and "Kablam!" His next episode is "The Canine Mutiny" [4F16].


>> Cult favorites

Dale G. Abersold:  John Waters is a cult film director whose films have
   featured filth, depravity, and Divine, the morbidly obese
   transvestite actor. Among his titles are "Mondo Trasho," "Pink
   Flamingos," and "Polyester" (the only movie ever filmed in
   Smell-O-Rama). His more recent efforts have been the mainstream
   "Hairspray" (a movie in which Marge's hairstyle would be
   inconspicuous) and "Serial Mom."

Mark Aaron Richey:  For most of his career, his films were decidedly
   strange and violent. He got his start making 8 and 16 millimeter
   films with friends, and eventualy got to the point where his films
   were hitting the midnight circuit, and then on to regular runs in
   specialty theaters. His first major film was "Pink Flamingos", a 1972
   film about a contest to determine "the filthiest person alive". The
   film (which is due for a 25th anniversery re-release later this
   year), concluded with Divine, a transvisite who was one of Waters's
   best friends and a regular in his films until his 1988 death, eating
   real live dog gifts. His 1981 film "Polyester" was the first to
   recieve a regular release, and moviegoers were given a "scratch-off"
   card with certain smells that would come into play as the movie
   progressed (I'll leave it up to your imagination as to what those
   smells were). In 1988, Waters went mainstream (at least for him) with
   "Hairspray", a comedy starring the then-unknown Ricki Lake as an
   overweight early 60's teenager who lands a spot on the local teen
   dance show. His next two films, "Cry-Baby", a musical about teen
   delinquents in the 50's, and "Serial Mom", a comedy about a sweet
   wife and mother who has a nasty homicide habit, were not commericial
   successes, despite actual real stars in the films (the former had
   Johnny Depp, the latter had Kathleen Turner and Sam Waterson, and
   both had the now-known Ricki Lake). In case you are curious, yes,
   John Waters in real life is gay.

Aaron Varhola:  Other posters have commented on John Waters's film
   career; he also collects kitsch like that in real life. I remember
   several years ago, he was a guest on Letterman, and showed Dave some
   disgusting items he picked up in stores, including (I am not making
   this up) a roll of chocolate candies called "Dingleberries". (Waters
   is one of the few true classic Letterman guests because of his
   ability to utterly embarass Dave every time he is on the show).


>> The Story of Lupe Velez

Benjamin J. Robinson:  "The Simpsons" just expects you to know who Lupe
   Velez is. "Frasier," which referenced the same person (in the
   premiere episode, I believe) was kind enough to provide an
   explanation. Lupe Velez was an actress in Hollywood's early years.
   Despondent over the lack of recognition she was getting, Velez
   decided to end it all. She had a final meal, arranged her bedroom
   just so, overdosed on pills, and waited for the inevitable.
   Unfortunately, something she ate didn't agree with her, and she ran
   into the bathroom to throw up. There, with her head in the commode,
   is how Lupe Velez passed away. It was hardly what she planned, but
   she certainly got recognized for it.

Leisha Sibley:  Lupe Velez was a starlet in the 1940's, who was best
   known for the title role in the "Mexican Spitfire" series of films. I
   believe she was married to Johnny Weismuller ("Tarzan"), and was
   infamous for getting drunk in public, having multiple affairs and
   constantly forgetting to wear panties. Anyway, she got pregnant by
   someone other than her husband and attempted suicide by taking
   sleeping pills. What actually killed her was a violent reaction to
   the pills, leading to her drowning in her own toilet when she tried
   to get up and vomit. It's a very lurid story, which l originally read
   in Hollywood Babylon, and l wouldn't be surprised if that's where
   "John" got his information, too.


>> Some come out of the closet, and some others get back in...

Whereas Homer seems very keen at pointing out "clues" about Bart, it's
   funny how he chooses to ignore or forget those he exhibited himself
   throughout all those years...

   - [7F02]  Never minded about his male secretary, Karl, being gay. Of
             course, he didn't even realize this fact, but being kissed
             by a man might have lit up a few lights.

   - [7F08]  Failing to be the father of a boy who wins the putting
             tournament, mows his neighbor's laws in his wife Sunday
             dress.

   - [8F14]  Kisses Chief Wiggum when returned Maggie safe and sound.

   - [8F16]  Homer contributes to Edna's letter: "P.S. I am gay."

   - [9F08]  Sings "Girls Just Want to Have Fun".

   - [9F13]  His simple advice to Lisa: "Six simple words:  I'm not gay,
             but I'll learn."

   - [9F16]  During negociations with Burns, thinks his boss is coming
             onto him, and declares himself "flattered, maybe even a
             little curious".

   - [9F20]  When fresh out of clean clothes, resorts to Marge's wedding
             dress.

   - [1F12]  Marched with his family in a gay parade.  {jr}

   - [1F14]  Imagines himself wearing a Marge wig, and taking his wife's
             role. ("Heh heh, I don't need her at all any more.") Later
             kisses Ned.

   - [2F08]  Favorite song is "It's Raining Men"  {dm}

   - [2F08]  Stands in a lesbian bar without any remorse.  {jr}

   - [2F09]  His father is the president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
             "for some reason".

   - [2F21]  "Marge, you being a cop makes you the man...which makes me
             the woman. I have no interest in that, besides occasionally
             wearing the underwear -- which, as we discussed, is
             strictly a comfort thing."


>> Let's keep it clean, boys!

There's no single episode of which all alt.tv.simpsons denizen will have
   the same opinion. The episode you like is the episode someone else
   hates, and vice versa. Follow the "Worst ever", "all-time classic",
   "stop whining about characters and enjoy the jokes", "you have no
   idea what The Simpsons is about" and other usual threads.

   Nonetheless, there's nothing like as controversial a subject as
   homophobia to stir up the eternal flames. Here are two reviews, at
   the extreme opposite of each other. Both were written by otherwise
   "sane" people -- as long as you think of us Simpsons fans as sane :)
   -- and showcase the variety of opinion you can expect from a.t.s., as
   well as the casual loss of temper and name-calling.  [My dearest
   apologies to the authors for dragging them in the mud like this. :)]

Graham KGW:  Man, I'm sure there'll be a million Purists up here in a
   couple of minutes bitching like mad about the incontinuity of
   characters or something on this episode, but let me just say that I
   thought it was the funniest episode I've seen in a really long time.
   It was so great, non-stop comedy, little to no crappy sentiment, and
   great jokes. Congrats, writers, on a job well done. I'm still
   laughing... prove me wrong, guys. Prove to me that this kind of stuff
   isn't over your head. I'm talking to you, Boswell, Varhola,
   Lepenguin, etc... (A+)

Damien Ryall:  If I called Matt Groening a fag for producing this trash,
   maybe he would realize how awful it really is! If I could, I would
   have bashed Homer's thick skull in with a sledge hammer halfway
   through the second act! Since when is Homer afraid of homosexuals,
   after 'Homer the Smithers' you would think he didn't care. When the
   hunting business came up I wanted to turn off the television. By the
   end, I wished that I had. (Z) (You can't get any lower than that)


>> The Eternal Threads
 
   - Is Smithers Gay?

Haynes Lee:  It seems like John broke a date with Smithers using the
   excuse that he was seeing his sick mother.


>> Loose Ends

Daniel Sheiner:  It would be nice if some time in the future, they
   display a similar couch scene which is loading #2... and of course
   some more furious clicking. Perhaps a reboot of the computer...

Haynes Lee:  According to the Urban Legends FAQ, there are no legal
   limits on how much of your debts you can pay in coins in the US,
   though some Treasury PR flack did imply otherwise for pennies and
   nickels, and there have been legal limits on how much coin a creditor
   must accept. For some strange reason, Canadian law is much clearer on
   this topic, stating that a quanity over 25 pennies is not legal
   tender.

Joe Klemm:  A price of around $8,000 for a TV Guide Jackie Kennedy once
   owned may be a reference to an auction that happened last summer. All
   the stuff that were bid on were stuff that the Kennedys once owned.

Mark Aaron Richey:  Laverne & Shirley-Promently featured on Jackie O's
   TV Guide, this late 70's spin-off of "Happy Days" had Penny Marshall
   (yes, the Babysitter Bandit) and Cindy Williams undergoing wacky,
   slapstick adventures in 1950's Baltimore.

Steve Shiue:  The humor of the old Batman live action show (Adam West,
   Eartha Kitt as Cat Woman, Julie Newmar as Batgirl etc.) was pure
   camp. (Easier to give examples than to explain the concept.) Also,
   the John Waters film "Hairspray" if you've seen it, which achieved
   quite a bit of mainstream popularity. Debbie Harry and Sonny Bono as
   suburban parents? The Corny Collins dance show?

Benjamin J. Robinson:  If you picked "corn" as the vegetable on Marge
   Simpson's kitchen curtain, you won! Plus, you're better educated than
   the folks who put together Fox's "Simpsons" web site -- supposedly,
   they claimed the mystery vegetables were carrots. D'oh!

Joshua Fruhlinger:  It is quite appropriate that, immediately after
   Homer says "I like my gays flaming," John honks is horn which plays
   "Somewhere over the rainbow" from _Wizard of Oz._ In some circles,
   obsession with Judy Garland is consider as much a pointer of gay
   sexual identity, as, well, Abba. (See Smithers and "Waterloo" in
   "Mother Simpson.")

Bob Beecher:  A change from the script was the tune that John's car horn
   played right after that line! In the show that aired, it played,
   "Somewhere Over the Rainbow"; but in the script, it called for "Don't
   Cry For Me, Argentina".

Carol Anne:  Homer remarks that he likes his "homosexuals flaming." In
   case you didn't know it, in the New York city area, "homo" has been
   reduced to "'mo." (ie, he's a real 'mo). So homer is really talking
   about "flmaing 'mos", and that's where the next scene took place.

Mark Aaron Richey:  Fat Man & Little Boy, the names of the specials at
   the restaurant, just happen to be the names of the atomic bombs we
   dropped on Japan to end World War II (it's also the name of a rather
   dull movie starring Paul Newman about the building of the bombs).

Mark Aaron Richey:  Wow, Moe knows Cabinet Members.  Or at least former
   cabinet members. Warren Christopher is the former secretary of state
   under President Clinton.

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Moe sarcastically thanks Warren Christopher for
   the current lack of armed conflict. Actually, he should be thanking
   Madeline Albright, who replaced Christopher a short while ago.

To those who claimed the ending was predictable, Dave Traubert replies,
   tongue-in-cheek: The minute I saw the TV guide, I knew that they were
   going to get attacked by reindeer and have to be saved my a Japenese,
   rocket-launching Santa. :)


>> Partial lyrics to "Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)"  {ol}

      Does he love me I wanna know
      How can I tell if he loves me so?
      (Is it in his eyes?)
      Oh no, you'll be deceived
      (Is it in his eyes?)
      Oh no, you make-believe

      If you wanna know if he loves you so
      It's in his kiss
      That's where it is
      (Oh yeah)

      (Or is it in his face?)
      Oh no, it's just his charm
      (In his one embrace?)
      Oh no, that's just his arm

      If you wanna know if he loves you so
      It's in his kiss
      (That's where it is)

Come on, cantaloup!
-- Milhouse, the unknown gambler, "Homer's Phobia"

% But all dryer has its limits, and this one starts rattling wildly out
% of control.  Bart leans over the dryer to reach the "Off" button, but

No refunds, force majeure, read the back of your tickets.
-- Bart, "Homer's Phobia"

% After a visit from the Springfield Gas Company, Homer examines his

Skinner: Hmm.  These campaign buttons are all partisan.  Don't you have
         any neutral ones? "May the better man win?" "Let's have a good,
         clean election?" That sort of thing?
   Lady: Uh, no, but we do have some old shirt buttons.  They're kinda
         kooky and fun!
Skinner: Missy, you just talked yourself right out of a sale.

% shows off what he's found.

 Bart: [walking on pogo stilts]  Hey, Lis, check it out: pogo stilts.
       These were banned in all 50 states.

% Lisa and Bart spot a huge, elementary 50s robot.

-- "Homer's Phobia"

% The clerk introduces himself as John.

Marge: I have something that I'd like to sell.
 John: Please tell me it's your hair.
Marge: [flattered, giggles] No.  It's an heirloom my grandmother passed
       down to me. A very rare, old figurine from the Civil War.
 Lisa: Please don't construe our ownership of this as an endorsement of
       slavery.
 John: [eyes the doll] Hmm.  Well see, here's the thing on this.  It's a
       Johnny Reb bottle, early 1970s, one of the J & R Whiskey
       "Liquor Lads."  Two books of green stamps, if I'm not mistaken.
Marge: Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  It's a very, very old figurine.
 John: No, it's a liquor bottle.  [untwists a cap from the bottle]  See?
       [pours himself some whiskey and drinks it]
       That'll make your bull run.
Marge: Well... I guess it'll always be a monument to Grandma's secret
       drinking problem.

Fifty bucks for a toy?  No kid is worth that!
-- Homer's value of children, "Homer's Phobia"

 John: But this is the Rex Mars Atomic Discombobulator.  Don't you just
       love the graphics on this box?
Homer: No.  How can you love a box, or a toy or graphics?  You're a grown
       man.
 John: It's camp!
        [Homer stares nonplussed]
       The tragically ludicrous?  The ludicrously tragic?
Homer: Oh, yeah.  Like when a clown dies.
 John: Well, sort of.  But I mean more like inflatable furniture or
       "Last Supper" TV trays, or even this bowling shirt.
        [John is wearing Homer's "Pin Pals" t-shirt]
       Can you believe somebody gave this to goodwill?
        [Marge sneaks away]
-- Just because it's got your name and picture on it doesn't mean...,
      "Homer's Phobia"

Homer: And that kinda stuff is worth money?
 John: Boy howdy!

Homer: Do I know you?
-- Short term memory, "Homer's Phobia"

% John surveys the house, taking pictures.

John: Oh, the color scheme and the rabbit ears!  And the two point three
      children, I mean, where's the Hi-C?
Lisa: [walking in, holding a tray]  Hi-C and fluffernutters!
John: Oh!  And pearls on a little girl!  It's a fairy tale!
-- If you say so, "Homer's Phobia"

% In the kitchen, John admires the curtains.

 John: Oh, I've got the exact same curtains, only in my bathroom.
       Didn't you just die when you found these?
Marge: Not really.  They just had corn on them.  Kitchen...  Corn...
 John: Oh!
        [slaps Marge on the arm in an "Oh You!" manner]

Homer: [stops] Oh.  I'll just be another minute, John.  Have a seat.
       [resumes strangling]
-- Company rules, "Homer's Phobia"

% John looks at the Simpsons' vinyl collection.  Homer asks him if his
% records have "camp" value, and John thinks they do and comments, "You
% yourself are worth a bundle, Homer! Why I could wrap a bow around you
% and slap on a price tag." Homer laughs and starts dancing with John to
% a record.
%
% The rest of the family watch from inside the kitchen.  The kids
% comment on his love of Itchy & Scratchy -- and in Bart's case, of toy
% robots. Marge comments that Homer's "certainly taken a shine to him."
% To prove her right, both are laughing together in the living room.
%
% The next morning, Homer, enjoying John's company, decides one day to
% invite him and his wife over for drinks. But Marge doesn't think he's
% married.

Homer: That John is the greatest guy in the world.  We've gotta have him
       and his wife over for drinks sometime.
Marge: Hmm, I don't think he's married, Homer.
Homer: Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh?  Well, there's lots of foxy ladies
       out there.
Marge: Homer, didn't John seem a little... festive to you?
Homer: Couldn't agree more.  Happy as a clam.
Marge: [insisting]  He prefers the company of men!

       me!!
Marge: You're being ridiculous.
Homer: Am I, Marge?  Am I?  Think of the property values.  Now we can never
       say only straight people have been in this house.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

Marge: I'm very sorry you feel that way, because John invited us all out
       for a drive today, and we're going.
Homer: Woah-ho-ho, not me!  And not because John's gay, but because he's a
       sneak.  He should at least have the good taste to mince around and
       let everyone know that he's... that way.
Marge: What on Earth are you talking about?
Homer: You know me, Marge.  I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my
       homosexuals fa-laming.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% From outside can be heard a car horn, playing "Over the Rainbow."  Of
% course, it's nobody else than John himself, who's brought with him the
% Rex Mars Atomic Discombobulator.  Homer peeks out the window curtains,
% and John greets him with a friendly Discombobulator "zzzzzap!"

Homer: I'm not setting foot outside this house until _that_ man is gone!
 Bart: Oh, Dad!  You are the living end!
        [Homer narrows his eyes at Bart]
-- The first signs are always subtle, "Homer's Phobia"

% The whole family -- Dad excepted -- hops into John's car, complete
% with pine freshener and zebra-like interior.  Bart is seated next to a
% very weird robot, which kinda looks like a cross between Santa Claus,
% a cash register, and that alien creature from tonight's 3am horror
% movie.

Bart: Hey, where'd that cool creepy Santa come from?
John: Japan.  Except over there they call him "Annual Gift Man" and he
      lives on the moon.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% John drives the family through the more tinsel part of Springfield...

John: And that's where Kent Brockman was caught cheating in the
      Springfield marathon.
 All: Ooh...

John: And there's where Lupe Velez bought the toilet she drowned in.
 All: Ohhhh!
-- So many commonly ignored sights, "Homer's Phobia"

Smithers: John!
    John: Uhh, oh, Waylon!  I'd like you to meet the Simpsons!
Smithers: I know the Simpsons.  [sotto voce]  So this is your sick

    John: Don't do this to me, Waylon.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% The family's home, and Homer is literally waiting up, ready to spew
% more venomous homophobia.  Marge tries to calm him down, but to no
% effect. His worries grow worse when Bart shows him John's
% Discombobulator he got.

Bart: Hey Dad, look what I got!  [points the gun to him]  Zzap!  Zzap!

       Zzap!  Zzap!
-- The clues are adding up, "Homer's Phobia"

I hope you all saved room, because I made your favorite dessert.
Store-bought snack cakes -- both kinds.

% Homer examines Bart's selection between pink Snoballs and Cupcakes
% expectingly. He grits his teeth worriedly when Bart moves his hand for
% the Snoballs, then smiles when he reaches for the cupcakes. Back and
% forth goes Bart's hand -- and Homer's gestures. Finally, Bart picks
% the Snoball. Homer goes mad.
%
% In bed, Homer chews on his pillow, and Marge gets him to tell her
% what's wrong.

Homer: Marge, the boy was wearing a hawaiian shirt.
Marge: So?
Homer: There's only two kind of guys who wear those shirts: gay guys and
       big, fat party animals.  [sad] And Bart doesn't look like a big,
       fat party animal to me...
Marge: So, if you wore a Hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?
Homer: Right.  Thank you.

% Homer blames it all on his wife.

Do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?
-- Homer to Marge, "Homer's Phobia"

% Marge decides that if there is actually a problem with Bart worth
% worrying over, it must be that he's not spending time with his dad.
%
% The next day, Homer walks down the stairs, humming along to "Shoop
% Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)", which is indeed playing in the house.
% All smiling, he's all ready to spend some time with his son when,
% horror of all horrors, he finds him *dancing* on that song, wearing

%
% A short trip to the kitchen shows the source of all evil, chatting

 John: Well, good morning, sunshine.
Marge: Homer!  John brought us cactus candy!
Homer: Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all, just stay
       the hell away from my family.
 John: Well, now you don't get any candy. [pauses]  Naw, that's cruel.
       Take a teensy piece.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

 John: Homer, what have you got against gays?
Homer: You know!  It's not... usual.  If there was a law, it'd be
       against it!
Marge: Oh Homer, please!  You're embarrassing yourself.
Homer: No I'm not, Marge!  They're embarrasing me.  They're embarrassing
       America.  They turned the Navy into a floating joke.  They ruined
       all our best names like Bruce, and Lance, and Julian.  Those were
       the toughest names we had!  Now they're just, uh...
 John: Queer?
Homer: Yeah, and that's another thing!  I resent _you_ people using that
       word.  That's _our_ word for making fun of you!  We need it!!  Well
       I'm taking back our word, and I'm taking back my son!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% The case requires immediate treatment, so Homer drives away with the
% boy.

Homer: Don't worry, boy.  We're gonna set you straight.  By tomorrow

 Bart: What are you talking about, Homer?  Where are we going?
Homer: Just a couple of good old-fashioned manly places.
       [puts his arm around Bart] Father and son!
Brain: [thinking]  You're leaving the arm there too long!  You wanna

        [time passess...]
Homer: Well, it's been two hours.  How do you feel?

 Homer: Bart, I want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?
Roscoe: Roscoe.
 Homer: Roscoe here runs this mill.  He's gonna show us around to let you
        get a first-hand look at real all-American Joes doing what they do

  Bart: Why the hell would I wanna see that?
 Homer: [sotto voce] You'll thank me on your wedding night.

        Broadway.
-- The world today, "Homer's Phobia"

Barney: I always hoped Bart would grow up just like us.  What happened?
   Moe: Aw, it ain't no mystery.  The whole modern world's got a
        swishifying effect on kids today.  And their MTVs and their diet
        sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight, neither.  You gotta do it
        yourself, Homer, and you gotta do it fast.
 Homer: But what would turn Bart into a man fast?  You have to think for
        me!
   Moe: Well, let's see now, uh, time was you sent a boy off to war.
        Shooting a man'd fix 'em right up.  But there's not even any wars
        no more, thank you very much, Warren Christopher!
Barney: Hey, better yet, Bart could shoot a deer!  That's like shooting a
        beautiful man.
   Moe: Hey, he's right, Homer.  After the boy bags a deer, all the diet
        sodas in the world won't turn him back.  And you just sit right
        back and watch the grandchildren roll in.

Homer: Stand aside, Marge, I'm taking the boy deer hunting.  He's going to

Marge: What?!  You never went hunting before, and you're perfectly
       straight.
Homer: Oh yeah?  How long since you've had a baby?
 Lisa: But Dad, it's barbaric.  How does killing a deer make you more of a
       man?
Homer: It just does.  Name me one gay Indian.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

 John: Uh oh.  Something's gonna die.
Homer: Butt out, Buttinsky.  What would _you_ know about hunting?
 John: I know this much.  I wouldn't wear that hideous hat.  Here, take

Homer: Hang on to it, Toy-Boy!  You might need it when it starts raining
       naked ladies!

 Homer: [chuckling nervously]  No, boy.  You can't drive.  You're only
        ten.  You're going hunting.
   Moe: You ever been hunting before, there, Barty?
  Bart: Nope.  Something about a bunch of guys alone together in the

 Homer: That is a *very* immature attitude, young man.
-- You tell him, Homer, "Homer's Phobia"

% The virile campers reach their destination.

Remember, guys, the truck only holds six carcasses, so don't shoot
nothing but trophy bucks, huh?
-- Moe, "Homer's Phobia"

% But as the day goes by, everyone sits on rocks waiting for deer, while
% Barney drinks beer, the empty cans multiplying as the hours go by.
% Late at night, one has to admit that the whole exercice was pointless.

Barney: Aw, we should've just stayed at the bar and shot some rats.
   Moe: Hey, those ain't your rats, Barn.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% Homer isn't ready to call it quits yet, as the whole idea was for Bart

% Homer scoops Bart into his arms and the quartet drives home

  Moe: Come on, don't take this so hard, Homer.  You still got that
       other kid, uh... Lisa.  Let's, uh, take her out hunting tomorrow;
       make *her* into a man.
Homer: Aw, she'd never go.  She's a vegetarian.
  Moe: Oh, geez!  Homer, geez!  You and Marge ain't cousins, are you?
-- As least the tots have four fingers, "Homer's Phobia"

% Homer scolds himself for being a lousy dad.  However, Moe spots a sign
% advertising live reindeers for a Santa's village. "Cheer up, Homer!
% Christmas is coming early this year."
%
% Despite the sign "Closed for Season," Moe drives on, breaking the gate
% and entering Santa's Village.
%
% Meanwhile, at home...

John: Did he say where they were going?
Lisa: No.  They were just going to find a deer and make Bart shoot it.
John: Deer?  Ha!  Not around here.  They all migrated north when the
      state park converted to Astroturf.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% John continues: "The only thing around here that's even close to deer
% is..."
%
% Yup, reindeer.  The hunting group breaks into the reindeer's pen.

Homer: Hey, boy, wake up.  Your old man found some deer.
 Bart: Huh?  You did?
 Bart: Hey, wait, man.  Those are reindeer!
Homer: Yep.  And it's your shot, son.
        [hands Bart the gun]
 Bart: What?  I'm not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.
        [Moe nudges Homer]
Homer: Come on, boy.  Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?
 Bart: [pleading] Dad! [starts whimpering]
  Moe: Oh criminy.  Here come the waterworks.
Homer: Bart, I'm gonna turn my back, and when I turn around, I wanna see
       a whole PILE of dead reindeer!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% They all turn their backs and block their ears.  Moments later, a bang
% goes off. Homer congratulates his son, but Bart replies he's not even
% fired a shot.  Seems the sound is one of antlers colliding together,
% as the whole reindeer flock is acting angrily.

Hey, they're going nuts, like in those nature films!
-- Barney, National Geographic subscriber for life, "Homer's Phobia"

% "Must be mating season," Moe adds.  The reindeer line up against
% Homer, Bart, Moe and Barney, who all scream. Immediately, Barney and
% Moe find hiding places, but Homer's stuck in the middle.  As a father,
% he protects his son by raising him in the air.

 Bart: No, don't!  You have to protect yourself!
Homer: Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must...
        [a reindeer rushes him]
       Argh!
        [a reindeer from the other side of Homer rushes him too]
       Urgh!
 Bart: Dad, are you hurt?
Homer: Just... my bones... and organs.
-- And whatever's left inbetween, "Homer's Phobia"

% The reindeer keep knocking Homer around when the attack is interrupted
% by the toy-keyboard sound of "Jingle Bells."  The reindeer back away
% as this thing nears closer to a beaten up Homer, deadpanning "Ho ho
% ho..." Yup, it's the mechanical Santa, Mr. "Annual Gift Man" in person.

Homer: Look, Bart!  It's Santa Claus!
        [robot fires two missiles, which makes reindeer back-up]
 Bart: Woah, it's Santa all right.  And he is kicking ass!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% All the reindeer run away.

Homer: It's a miracle!
 John: [holding the Santa remote] No, ultrasuede is a miracle. This is
       just good timing.
Marge: Oh, Homie, I'm so glad you're safe.  [hugs him]
       Hmm, you feel softer than before.
Homer: [in pain] I've been tenderized.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

  Bart: How'd you know that thing would work?
  John: Well the sound is just _brutal_, and I figured reindeer would
        naturally be afraid of their cruel master Santa Claus.  I mean,
        wouldn't you be?  Ha!
Barney: Is it okay to come out now, Mr. Gay Man?  Sir?
   Moe: I'll do anything you say!  *Anything*!
-- "Homer's Phobia"

% All is well that ends well, as everyone heads home.  However, some
% wounds will take some time to heal...

Barney: Aw, Moe, we were saved by a sissy.
   Moe: Yeah, yeah, we'll never live it down.  Oh, boy, it looks like
        it's suicide again for me.
 Homer: Hey!  We owe this guy, and I don't want you calling him a sissy.
        This guy's a fruit, and a... no, wait, wait, wait: queer, queer
        queer!  That's what you like to be called, right?
  John: Well, that or John.
  Lisa: This is about as tolerant as Dad gets so you should be
        flattered.
-- "Homer's Phobia"

Well, Homer, I won your respect, and all I had to do was save your life.
Now, if every gay man could just do the same, you'd be set.
-- John sums up the situation, "Homer's Phobia"

% On the ride home, Homer delivers a long-awaited message to his son.

Homer: You know, Bart, maybe it's the concussion talking, but any way
       you choose to live your life is okay with me.
 Bart; Huh?
 Lisa: [whispering] He thinks you're gay.
 Bart: He thinks I'm gay?!
        ["Everybody Dance Now" plays on-screen]
-- So do some people on a.t.s., it seems, "Homer's Phobia"

% We cut closer and closer to Bart's mystified face in accordance with
% the song, which plays on as John's car drives off. The words
% "Dedicated to The Steelworkers of America Keep Reaching For That
% Rainbow" appear on screen as the song plays during the credits.
