    ... the signs that went past while Bart and Lisa were riding
        to the comic convention?  [I sure didn't.]
    ... the kid at the comic convention dressed as Krusty?
        [mandorallen@st1.vuw.ac.nz]
    ... the Itchy and Scratchy poster at the convention?
    ... Buddy `Fallout Boy' Hodges smokes?
    ... the goofy face Bart makes when he says `fine'?
        ``You really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a <fine> restaurant
        like Krusty Burgers?''
    ... Maggie smashing french fries into the table?
    ... young Marge was wearing a Lisa-dress?
    ... Millhouse sleeps with his glasses on?
    ... Marge's custom hood on her jacket?
    ... the crooked cops not only accepted Bart's bribe, but they
        also littered the street with the empty beer cups?  [Not
        to mention drinking on the job.]
    ... when Marge serves the boys milk and s'mores, it sounds like they're
        eating rocks!  (I.e., not the satisfying `crunch' followed by `munch
        munch' but rather the sound of, well, rocks being eaten.)

    ... the surly Krusty Burger employee at the counter?  (complete
        with cigarette and ketchup-stained uniform.)  [Gianni Schicchi]

    ... Patty and Selma didn't have raspy voices until they started
        smoking?  [Chuck Mosher]

and perhaps the single most important DYN of the entire episode...

    ... Radioactive Man had FIVE (count 'em!) fingers after the atomic
        bomb exploded! {cjb}

Truly inspired moments:

    The Wonder Years voice-over.  Yes, that was Daniel Stern's voice.

    At the very end when it looks as if we're going to have a moral
    sledgehammered into us, we get a nice twist.

Dave Hall {dh}:

Marge's apron is drawn rather badly.  From the front, you see where the
apron clearly tied and the two straps go over her shoulders, but from the
back, the straps are gone.  [And since when did apron have shoulder straps?

> The Awesome Powers of Bartman

sep00@outs.ccc.amdahl.com (Stephan E J Papa):

1) Ability to make whishing noise when moving into camera view.

2) Ability to change into always carried super-costume in a phone booth.

> The Wonder Years Voice-over

>> For non-American viewers

The program `Wonder Years' consists of the reminiscences of a now-adult
Kevin Arnold, who looks back on his childhood (circa 1970) and provides
voice-over narration of the action.

In the program, Kevin's narration is never interrupted because the adult
Kevin is telling the story in retrospect, and therefore can insert pauses
in the action wherever he wants.

>> Bart's version of the Wonder Years

David Tamkin explains:

What was really out of place for Bart's retrospectives is that an adult Bart
cannot yet exist, or it would violate the time line established in "The Way
We Was," "Principal Charming," "Bart Gets an F," "Three Men and a Comic
Book," "Moaning Lisa," "Some Enchanted Evening," and other episodes that have
given us ages or dates.  We have to view it as a flash-forward in Bart's mind
(like the one in "Bart Gets an F"); Bart zones out into thinking about how
he'll look back on these events when he reaches adulthood, but unlike the
narrations of a grown-up Kevin Arnold, who can hit the pause button on his
memories of childhood whenever he pleases, Bart <is> in his childhood and
cannot violate his childhood's timing.  Thus, his fantasy flash-forwards are
interruptible by the real events of his childhood but Kevin's retrospective
narrations are interruptible only by the real events of Kevin's adulthood,
but not by those of his adolescence, which are fitted around the narration.

> Rock, Scissors, Paper

Corby Page notes that `best 3 out of 5' doesn't make sense when there are
three players.

Andrew Tannenbaum (trb@ima.isc.com) notes:

I thought the writers intentionally goofed to add to the cathartic
irony of the scene, since the methods got successively more ridiculous.
They could have chosen to rotate Sundays, then they could have chosen
to reroll on zero, then they could have chosen a simpler game than Rock,
Scissors, Paper for three people.  Only when the method got silly
enough, did the three of them agree to it.

> rrauenza@polyslo.csc.calpoly.edu observes that the bank clerk's line ``Let
the good times roll!'' was spoken so that the word `times' came out like
`dimes'.  Pun?  Happy coincidence?  You make the call.

> Questions
===============================================================================
What are imitation marshmallows?  Marshmallows are already one of the most
artificial foods on the face of the earth!

mandorallen@st1.vuw.ac.nz asks...

    ... why was it that Marge got her gravel voice from birth, while
        Patty and Selma only developed it through smoking?
    ... any speculation on the _special_ relationship that seems to have
        existed between Dirk "Radioactive Man" Richter and Buddy "Fallout
        Boy" Hodges?

% Marge chauffeurs Lisa and Bart en route to the Springfield Comics
% convention...

Lisa:  If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will
       be gone!
Bart:  Ah, what do you care about good comics?  All you every buy is Casper
       the Wimpy Ghost.
Lisa:  I think it's sad that you equate friendliness with wimpiness, and
       I hope it'll keep you from ever achieving true popularity.
Bart:  Well, you know what I think?  I think Casper is the ghost of
       Richie Rich. [shows comics of Casper and Richie Rich]
Lisa:  Hey, they do look alike!
Bart:  Wonder how Richie died.
Lisa:  Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money really is and
       took his own life.
Marge: Kids, could you lighten up a little?
-- driving to the comics convention, ``Three Men and Comic Book''

% At the convention, Bart and Lisa stand in line for tickets, and discover

Too bad you didn't come dressed as a popular cartoon character.
-- Lisa to Bart at the comics convention, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''
   [a little meta-humor for your enjoyment]

% So Bart ducks into a phone booth and emerges as BartMan.  But it doesn't
% get him a discount.  Diamond Joe Quimby delivers the opening address for the
% convention.  Martin goes to the lost-and-found table in search of a left
% Vulcan ear.  At a table where prospective artists have the opportunity
% to show their work to an industry professional, Bart happens upon Otto.

Bart: Oooh, what's that?
Otto: My very own idea for a comic book, little man.
      [unveils his conception of Busman, which bears a distinct resemblance
      to Otto despite some anatomically awesome features]
      It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night,

Bart: Cool!

% Bart attends a film exhibition of one of the early Radioactive Man

    smoke Laramies.
Radioactive Man: Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're sixteen.

% The convention's celebrity guest is none other than Buddy `Fallout Boy'

% After the seminar, Bart checks out a dealer's display table.  The dealer

       childhood had slipped away, forever.
Homer: Bart!  What are you staring at?
Bart:  Uh, nothing.  [Daniel Stern continues]  He didn't say it, and neither
