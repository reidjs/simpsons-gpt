    ... the lighting behind Lisa makes it look like she has a halo around
        her head? {cjb} (Towards the end of the show, when she

===============================================================================

Yours Truly {rjc}:  Absolutely stupenderiffic.  Lots of lines that are
hilarious in context, like ``Man, this place has got everything!'' and
the fall-out-of-my-chair, ``Hey, listen, lady!''

Paul McCartney on the tombstone is a reference to the `Paul is Dead'
hoax of 1969.  (According to the hoax, Paul was killed in a car crash in
1966 and was replaced by an exact duplicate.)

Further, many Beatles songs supposedly featured ``clues'' to Paul's
demise.  ``Number nine'' (Revolution #9) backwards says ``Turn me on,
deng men'' and the babble at the end of ``I'm So Tired'' backwards says
``ul is debneh, miss him, miss him, miss him.''  And the best clue,
``the Walrus *was* Paul'' from ``Glass Onion.''  According to the
rec.music.beatles FAQs, all four Beatles have vigorously denied any
connection to the hoax (I suppose Pete Best was unavailable for comment).

Matt Groening wanted the title for the Alien book to be ``How to Cook
for Forty Humans and then Eat Them,'' but it was vetoed.

For this capsule, the text of the Raven used is that which is listed by
the E.A. Poe Society of Baltimore as `T'.  It was the last version printed
before Poe's death.  The full poem may be found here:

===============================================================================
% On a stage, Marge pops out from behind a curtain.

Hello everyone.  You know, Hallowe'en is a very strange holiday.  Personally,
I don't understand it.  Mm mm...  Kids worshipping ghosts, pretending to be
devils.  Oooh, things on TV that are <completely> inappropriate for younger
viewers.  Things like the following half hour.  Nothing seems to bother <my>
kids. But tonight's show, which I totally wash my hands of, is really scary.
So if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed
early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow.  Thanks for
your attention.

% ``The Simpsons Halloween Special''.  Thunderstorm.  Pan across Springfield
% Cemetery...  Push in on the Simpsons' home, panning upward to the treehouse,
% where Lisa's distinctive hairstyle can be seen in the window.  Down below,
% a sheeted ghost approaches.  It's Homer, carrying a bag of treats.

Ooh, what a haul this year.  I <love> Hallowe'en!
-- Homer returns from a night of trick-or-treating, ``Treehouse of Horror''

% He spots the light on in the treehouse and investigates.
%
% Inside, Lisa holds a flashlight to her face and concludes telling her
% scary story to Bart and Maggie.  Bart is hardly impressed and says it
% wasn't scary.  After a brief ``Is not!''/``Is too!'' argument, Lisa
% hands Bart the flashlight and tells him to give it his best shot.
% ``Here's a story that's reeeeeeeeeeeeally scarifying.''  (``Oh, brother.'')

Bart:  Are you my conscience?

% Meanwhile, the house tells Lisa, ``Lisa... The butcher knife, Lisa...''
% Lisa takes a butcher knife out of her drawer.  (``Weird kid,'' observes
% Chris Baird {cjb}.)  She tests its sharpness and grins evilly.
%
% In his bedroom, Homer wields an axe.  ``They are all against me...  They

% In the kitchen, Marge reaches for a serrated bread knife...
%
% Homer wanders into the kitchen, followed by Bart (cleaver), Lisa (butcher

% teeth.  The four march in a circle, laughing maniacally.  In the kitchen,
% Marge lowers her knife...
%
% To spread mayonnaise on a sandwich.  She emerges into the living room
% and asks, ``What's going on out here!''  Everyone apologizes to each
% other.  (Maggie sucks apologetically.)

This family's had its differences, and we've squabbled,
but we never had knife fights before.

GROUND!  ...   NO YOU DIDN'T!  ...  Well, that's not <my> recollection. ...
Yeah?  Well, all right, goodbye!  [angrily hangs up]  He said he mentioned

-- Homer, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''

% Marge is about to leave.

You will diiiiieeeee.  You will die slowwwwwwwly.

House: What?
Bart:  Make the walls bleed.
House: No!
Bart:  Hey, man, we own you.  Let's see some blood!
House: I don't have to entertain <you>.
Bart:  Come on, man, do it.  Do the blood thing.  Come on, do it.

% The house rejoinds, ``Hey, listen, lady!''  Marge tells the house that
% that will have to learn to live together.  The house asks to think about

% The house folds in on itself and explodes.

-- Bart watches the house self-destruct,

% [End of Act One]

% Lisa is unimpressed, so Bart decides to show her...  ``This severed finger!''

% The Simpsons are having a barbecue on the back patio.  Homer turns on the bug

% A drooling, green, octopus-like alien introduces himself.

Alien: Greetings.  I am Kang.  Do not be frightened.  We mean you no harm.

-- Lisa pleads for mercy from the aliens,

% But her plea is interrupted by a buffet cart.  ``Take all you want, but

% For Homer, pork chops.  And for Marge...

% Dinner is announced.  Lisa asks why the aliens never eat, and they explain

%
% While the aliens weigh Bart and Homer, Lisa explores.  She discovers the

% She rushes back to the dining room and shows the family her discovery.

% Lisa blows off more dust:  ``How to Cook <Forty> Humans.''  Kodos blows
% off yet more dust.  The full title reads ``How to Cook <for> Forty Humans.''
% The aliens are shocked and hurt that the Simpsons thought they were going
% to eat them.  (``Frankly, you people made pigs of yourselves.'') Serak the

% Homer:    "'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door --
%                                                  This it is and nothing more."

Narrator: Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
Homer:    "Sir,"
Narrator:        said I,
Homer:                   "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
          But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
          And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
          That I scarce was sure I heard you "
Narrator:                                      -- here I opened wide the door; ----
Homer:    [throws open the door and covers his eyes]
Bart:     [impatiently]  This better be good.
Homer:    [peeks through his fingers]
Narrator:                                      Darkness there and nothing more.
Homer:    Huh?
-- ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''

% Sitting outside the treehouse is Homer, clearly scared.  Bart complains,
% ``You know what would have been scarier than nothing?''  ``What?''
% ``ANYTHING!''
%
% Narrator: Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
%           Soon again I heard a tapping something&lt;1&gt; louder than before.
% Homer:    "Surely,"
% Narrator:           said I,
% Homer:                      "surely that is something at my window lattice;
%           Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --
%
%
% Homer opens the window.
%
% Narrator: Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
%           In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
%
% The raven bears a striking resemblance to Bart.
%
% Narrator: Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
%           But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door --
%           Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door --
%                                           Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
%
% Homer chuckles.

Homer:    "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"
Narrator:                                               I said,
Homer:                                                          "art sure no craven,
          Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore --
          Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
Narrator:                                        Quoth the Raven
Bart/Raven:                                                      Eat my shorts!
-- ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''

% Lisa tells Bart that the Raven says ``Nevermore'' and nothing else.
% Bart reluctantly gives in.
%
% An odor wanders past, and Homer catches a whiff of it.
%
% Narrator: Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by some&lt;2&gt; unseen censer
%
% The `unseen' censer whaps Homer upside the head.  (``D'oh!'')
%
% Narrator: Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
%
% The seraphim in question are an angelic Lisa and Maggie.
%
% Homer:    "Wretch,"
% Narrator:           I cried,
% Homer:                       "thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee
%           &lt;3&gt;respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;
%
% Homer orates before the portrait of Lenore.
%
% Homer:    Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"
% Narrator:                                          Quoth the Raven
% Bart/Raven:                                                        "Nevermore."
% Homer:    D'oh!
%
% Homer is really angry now.
%
% Homer:    "Be that word our sign of&lt;4&gt; parting, bird or fiend!" 
% Narrator:                                                             I shrieked, upstarting --
% Homer:    "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
%           Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has&lt;5&gt; spoken!
%           Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door!
%           Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
% Narrator:                                          Quoth the Raven
% Bart/Raven:                                                        "Nevermore."
% Homer:    [trying to stay calm]
%           Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
% Narrator:                                          Quoth the Raven
% Bart/Raven:                                                        "Nevermore."
% Homer:    Why you little...!
% Bart/Raven: Uh-oh!
%
% Homer lunges for the Raven, who flits off.  Homer chases the bird across
% and around the room, who remains barely out of reach.
%
% Homer:    Come back here, you little Raven!
%
% Homer's chase makes a mess of his chamber.
%
% Homer:    D'ah, grf, son-of-a, d'oh!
%
% Homer throws a potted plant at the Raven, who dodges the projectile.  In
% true cartoon fashion, the plant hits Homer on the head.  Tiny Ravens dance
% around Homer's head, chanting, ``Nevermore, Nevermore, Nevermore...''
%
% The chase continues.  The Raven plucks books from the shelf and drops them.
%
% The Raven has returned to its place atop the bust of Pallas.  Below lies
% the carnage it has wrought upon the room.
%
% Narrator: And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
%           On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
%           And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
%           And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
%           And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
%                                                  Shall be lifted -- nevermore!

% &lt;2&gt; Original says ``from an'' not ``by some''
% &lt;3&gt; Original has ``Respite -- '' at the beginning of the line
% &lt;4&gt; Original says ``in'' not ``of''

%
% The Raven chuckles evilly.
%
% Fade back to the treehouse.

Bart: Lisa, that wasn't scary.  Not even for a poem.
Lisa: Well it was written in 1845.  Maybe people were easier to
      scare back then.
Bart: Oh, yeah.  Like when you look at ``Friday the Thirteenth, Part 1''.
      Pretty tame by today's standards.

% Marge calls the kids to bed, and Bart brags that he won't have any trouble
% falling asleep tonight.  As the kids descend, we see Homer sitting outside
% the treehouse, shivering.
%
% Maggie, Lisa, and Bart all sleep soundly in their respective rooms.  Homer
% begs Marge not to turn off the light, with no success.  Through the window,
% he sees the Bart/Raven, which chuckles before flying away.  ``Oh, I hate
% Hallowe'en.''
