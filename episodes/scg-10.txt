[===========================[Season Ten Summary]============================]

Story cut episodes: 5F19, AABF02, AABF03, AABF07, AABF09, AABF10, AABF13.
Compressed episodes: All episodes were compressed.
Changed content: AABF10.

Story time cut: 3:03 (3 min 3 sec)
Total time gained: 29:45 (29 min 45 sec)

Notes: One will notice the lack of cuts in Season 10. Woo hoo! It seems that
       they've opted more for compression than cuts. By Season 11 we notice
       that cuts are almost non-existent. Too bad we can't apply this type
       of syndication to some butchered classics. *Sigh* [-ed]
