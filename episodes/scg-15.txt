[=========================[Season Fifteen Summary]==========================]

Story cut episodes: All but EABF21, FABF11, FABF15, FABF18.
Compressed episodes: All but FABF03, FABF08.
Expanded episodes: FABF06, FABF08.
Missing lines: FABF02.
Added content: EABF19, FABF01, FABF12 (openings); EABF22, FABF03 (recycling).
Changed content: FABF01, FABF06, FABF07, FABF09, FABF12, FABF17.

Total time cut: 6:28 (6 min 28 sec) (lengthened intro times not counted)
Story time cut: 6:28 (6 min 28 sec)
Total time gained: 10:10 (10 min 10 sec)

Notes: Careful viewers will note that the edited openings are no longer
       "voiceless," as in seasons 13 and 14. Like seasons 13 and 14, however,
       the TV ratings are still missing.

       I would like to note that I only had access to a few original full-
       length credits; as they all seem to be 48 seconds anyway, it's
       probably fine. I also have not included the time "un-cut" by
       lengthened openings in the episode headers, so you know.

       A few trends: For some reason, three episodes were given longer
       opening sequences, even though two of them needed absolutely no help
       there; if someone can explain this, please let me know. (Like 7F01 for
       season 14, DABF02 is the opening filler of choice, often overriding
       existing elements.) Also perhaps to add time, there seem to be pauses
       of a few seconds before the first acts of FABF04/05/09/08/10/13 and
       maybe more, which I imagine is a nationwide trait; again, information
       would be useful.

       One thing I have not noticed before is that almost every time
       compression is used in Act I, it does not begin until just after the
       running credits end. There must be a reason for this; I know it not.

       As if to round off the insanity, it seems that this season's favored
       method of dealing with continuous credit music (see also the class
       of 2F03 et al., CABF12, DABF03, EABF07 and EABF08, and so forth) is to
       excise it entirely after the commercial break, and replace it with the
       usual theme music. (FABF10 stands out as an exception.)

       ! As you may already know, the original run (and perhaps the rest)
       ! featured a fun editing glitch. In the transition between the
       ! newspaper closeup ("...4th Street overpass midnite") and a wider

       ! a blue background, "THE SIMPSONS / TAKE 02 / SC 075 / AKOM" (slashes

          Bart: Lis, you made this school even worse! And it wasn't exactly
                San Diego State to begin wtih.

       % In her room, Lisa has discarded her outfits (the pink suit and brown
       % jacket, plus purse, necklace, earrings) on her bed and is back in
       % her red dress and shoes. She is sitting on the bed and brushing out

       %        postage stamps. [grabs a stack of sheets, each with 12-20

       %        [bat voice] No, don't kiss me! [more kissy sounds and moan]

         Lisa bursts into Skinner's office.

       ! Note that besides being an important plot point, this cut introduces
       ! a bit of a continuity error, when Lisa is suddenly dressed her own
       ! way.

 ~~
         Chief: [to Lou] Well, I can't take that rattlesnake out of his
                mailbox _now_, now can I?

          Kent: The Springfield student strike has entered its fourth day
                with no end in sight.

       ! Note that the cut line makes--made--a nice parallel with Chalmers'

         Homer puts out the fire, grabs a torch, and pushes the back wall,

       ! In syndication, this cut might be obvious; on my first pass, I
       ! thought I caught a glimpse of something between the two bounding
       ! scenes. Going frame by frame revealed nothing, but my VCR doesn't
       ! skip by fields (half-frames), and I suspect that it's a leftover in
       ! one of the fields. If someone with such a capability could check
       ! this and send me a note, I'd be happy. (See also EABF18.)
