   [For the sake of reference, here is a TV Guide-like synopsis: When Krusty's
   attempt at observational humor fails horribly, he decides to speak his mind
   -- and it's funny! Back on the scene with more impact than ever, Krusty is
   faced with the option of staying respected and funny, or selling out.]

       all four microphones from the podium?

Anthony Dean:
   ... Maggie only appears at the mall scenes (if I'm not mistaken)?

Don Del Grande:

John Isles IV:

   ... when Krusty hair came undone while he was talking to the business
       execs, he happens to have two extra rubber bands with him, since I

= In the last shot at The Pimento Grove, Krusty throws away a cigarette he

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Miranda Buckle:  I was thrilled to see that the writers had come up with
   something this good! Some of the highlights were Homer's lines "You have
   to EARN the cracker!" and "Don't you hate pants?"  I also loved Mel's line
   "You can be so cruel when you're sober."  I was laughing out loud at so
   many scenes, it's hard to remember them all!  And that commercial at the
   end was simply classic.  I was glad to see Krusty again!  We haven't seen
   him for so long, it's about time we saw him in his purest sense- the guy
   who merchandises everything!  And I was also glad to see Mel actually
   WITH Krusty this time.  In some of the other more recent episodes, we've
   seen a lot of Mel by himself.  I was always wondering where Krusty was.
   And by the way- I don't care what you say, I thought the plot was superb.
   No unsatisfying open endings, no dramatic changes at the end, not too
   far-fetched, and with plenty of gags.  (A+)

Steve Bunnell:  I was left a little dry by "Das Bus" last week, but this
   episode filled in the gap left by it. The celebrity cameos were great,
   every Homer line was funny, and Krusty's short-lived new style of comedy
   was hilarious! (A+)

Ben Collins:  A mostly pointless affair; indubitably the worst "Bart Saves
   Krusty" episode ever. Marge was far out of character in the shoe store
   scene; the rest went on a stumbling, badly paced autopilot with dumb gags
   and an uninteresting story. "Observational" humor about stand-up comics
   is not what made the Simpsons great.  (D+)

Chris Courtois:    Maybe "The Last Temptation of Krust" should have kept the
   alternate title "Clown Time is Over", as there certainly isn't much life
   left in the "Bart helps Krusty recover from a career dip" plotline.
   There really wasn't too much wrong with the episode outside of a few rake
   scenes (Dr. Hibbert laughing at the mall, Homer not getting the jokes),
   but there wasn't too much that was great about it either, other than the
   quite funny Canyonero commercial, which  despite being the highlight of
   the show was still too little, too late.  The celebrity cameos were
   mostly wasted and seemed to be pure ratings ploy, as only Jay Leno and
   Janeane Garofalo got more than one line. All in all, a thoroughly
   mediocre C, bumped up to a C+ by the Canyonero commercial.  (C+)

Anthony Dean:  Tonight's episode was quite an improvement from the last few
   weeks' episodes. It was interesting to see Krusty finally realize (albeit
   temporarily) that his crass commercialization of literally everything
   finally caught up to him.  The Sports Utility Vehicle commercial seemed
   pretty dead-on commentary on this current status symbol item; Krusty's
   impromptu stand-up performance at the news conference was the best part of
   the episode. Jay Leno appearing didn't do too much for me, though (though
   this is probably the only time one would get to see what Leno might look
   like with a chin-ectomy :-)  (B)

Nathan Mulac DeHoff:  This episode really didn't have much in the way of a
   plot, and the special guest stars didn't do that much for me, since I'm
   not very familiar with their work, but it was pretty funny.  Among the
   highlights were the opening scene in the mall, Kent Brockman's filling in
   for Krusty, and the commercial at the end.  I was also pleased in that it
   did not turn out to be a remake of "Krusty Gets Kancelled."  (B)

Jordan Eisenberg:  On my first viewing, I hated this episode.  It seemed
   formulaic, slow, forced and nauseatingly disregardful of the characters'
   traits.  I thought this right up to the first scene of my second viewing,
   when I began to appreciate it.  It made a clever statement about 'new
   age' comedy and I related to every word of it.  Not since "Easy Bake
   Coven" have I related to its satire so well.  On the Simpsonesque scale,
   it rates somewhere in the middle, for the hidden references and shoe
   store scene.  Not many things are quotable, although there were some
   clever lines ("You kids are WAY overdue for a growth spurt!",  "Excuse
   me, sir, [To Dr. Hibbert] do you like to laugh?").  Ingenuity showed
   with many things such as Krusty's new hairdo and the 'Is this thing
   on?' gag.  This episode goes from a C+ to a B- because I've been
   humming 'Canyonero' all day.

Jeremy Gallen:  Excellent episode!  It packed quite a laugh!  I personally
   liked the part at the end about the "Canyonero"!  (A+)

Don Del Grande:  It felt like an episode of "Dr. Katz", only with the
   characters moving around, the backgrounds in color, nobody squiggling,
   and Bart and Lisa much better than Ben and Laura... but at least on "Dr.
   Katz", the routines are good.  (B-)

John Isles IV:  I thought that Leno's voice did have a good, long on-tape
   time, but really wasn't enough.  This episode was mediocre at best;  The
   ONLY good laugh I had was when Krusty was at OFF's house-- Krusty looks
   into a poster of him and says, "I have a tack in my forehead" or
   something like that.  Also, the other comics-- Janeane Garofalo, Steve
   Warner, Bruce Baum, and Bobcat Goldthwait-- deserved, and should have
   gotten, more time.  A disappointment in the trails of "Das Bus" & "Joy of
   Sect".  I liked Krusty's hair when it was like George Carlin's -- Held
   together in the back of the head with a rubber band.  (C+)

Darrel Jones:  I liked this episode! The best part was the car ad at the end.
   I also liked Homer's line about "Bart, why didn't you tell me you were
   washing a clown with two men and a monkey?"

Joe Klemm:  A very clever episode thanks to Krusty's act and the Canyonero
   song by Hank Williams Jr. However, when it come to Jay Leno, I think the
   five minute short where he is with the kids of South Park is better.  (A-)

Diego Kontarovsky:  I loved Krusty's Carlin routine!  I am a HUGE Carlin fan!
   All the subtleties of his act were there.  Hope the Spanish soap opera
   isn't cut in syndication, cuz I finally got to hear my name on the show.
   Better than last week; not amazingly good, but not too shabby, either.
   Meaning they had some good gags, but it's lacking the magic that's present
   in past episodes, such as Deep Space Homer (1F13), or Duffless (9F14).  I
   miss Homer's angry outbursts.  But I liked it, because it seems they can't
   do any better right now.  (A-)

Haynes Lee: Slightly better than this season's offering but nowhere close to
   "Krusty Gets Kancelled".

Jake Lennington:  Overall, an episode that is all glitter and no substance.
   This episode could've done so much more with the comedians, but they
   decided to waste too much time doing another "Krusty Gets Kancelled".
   Honestly, the only time I laughed was when the Sport/Utillity Vehicle was
   running over the deer in the commercial.  (D-)

Andrew Milner:  Okay, not unwatchable, but a notch below the last two
   episodes. The Blum, Garofalo, Goldthwait and Wright cameos weren't enough
   to write home about.

Michael K. Neylon:  Overall, another weak outing, not strictly anything wrong,
   but so much that could have been done better.

Jeremy Reaban:  Not painful, and had some funny moments. However, the plot
   wasn't that original. Didn't Krusty cease being funny a couple times
   before? Oh well. Homer has some great moments "Impeach Churchill!",
   "Don't you hate pants?"  (C+)

Tom Rinschler:  Another so-so effort.  The first two acts went really slowly,
   and only the third picked up a little.  There were only a few good laughs
   here and there -- but the second "Canyonero" ad was classic ROFL! (Great
   meta-humor joke: "you're due for a growth spurt any time now!";  after
   nine seasons I hope so!)  The plotting wasn't bad, and the characterization
   was actually quite good (Lisa was portrayed very well), both of which drag
   the episode back from the abyss. But you think with so many comedians,
   they could have come up with a bit more humor.  (C+)

Benjamin Robinson:  We've seen the premise before, and we'd like to see more
   of the guest stars, but "Clown Time is Over" is a hilarious episode.
   (Which is apt, since it's about comedy.)  Krusty's attempts to remake
   himself for the Nineties are accompanied by a steady stream of good jokes
   from the cast.  It's Donick Cary's best "Simpsons" to date.  (A-)

Matt Rose:  A dismal effort. Joke after joke failed to make me laugh, with
   all those comedians up there you'd think something would. But the only
   laugh I had at all was for "Java the Hut". Celebrity cameos do nothing for
   me, and neither does stand-up type of humor. A very weak outing in a very
   weak season... something has to change.  (D)

Yours truly:  A pretty good episode. Some bits (Bart's "funniest man alive"
   etc.) annoyed me a little, just due to the cheesiness, but most of it was
   funny. Wrapped up a bit soon, too, but one of the highlights of the season.
   (B)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Bill Hicks / Krusty

An in-depth, informational and interesting investigation on whether or not
   new-style Krusty was based on Bill Hicks, by Tom Brown:

   Last Temptation of Krust is clearly an episode about the financial
   pressures comedians face which cause them to compromise their material.
   Krusty temporarily transforms himself into a rebel comedian so for a brief
   moment we can see on TV what a comedian would look like who doesn't sell
   out. It seems there has been some discussion on which comedian(s) this
   character has been modeled after.  Was it Dennis Leary, George Carlin,
   Dennis Miller? Or was it Bill Hicks?  Most people have never heard of Bill
   Hicks, primarily because just as he had reached a certain level of
   popularity, his material was censored from the CBS version of David
   Letterman (after 11 appearances on the NBC version) because it was too
   controversial and he died of pancreatic cancer in February, 1994.  At the
   beginning of 5F10, the family runs into publicity volunteers for the
   Springfield Comedy Festival at, of all places, the mall.

   Bart: "Hey, somebody screwed up bad.  You've got all these big comics lined
          up for your show, but there's no Krusty!"
   Festival Volunteer: "Who?"
   Bart: [irritated] "Krusty the clown!...Funniest man alive..."

   Bill Hicks appeared on TV through the help of Jay Leno.  Jay appeared
   several times on British Channel 4's documentary "Just a Ride":

   Leno: "He really wasn't a comedian when I met him, he was, starting to be a
         comedian, I mean I knew him, god, twelve, thirteen years, he was
         still a kid, he was in high school, and I was playing in Austin, and
         he would come and listen, you know, when you're a comedian, you've
         been on TV, inevitably, the comedy club owner always says, oh,
         there's a group of people in the city, would you talk to them about
         comedy? Okay, so, one of the afternoons, you go down, you talk to
         them about comedy, I think he had a comedy workshop at this club, and
         ah... I always find when you're teaching comedy, the one who sort of
         gets up in disgust and leaves and thinks you're a jerk is usually the
         best comedian in the room." (reference #1)

   Bart asks to see the organizer to vent his incredulity about the absence of
   Krusty:

   Bart: "Well, if you're running the show, how can you leave out Krusty the
          Clown?"
   Jay Leno: "Ahh, Krusty the clown...that takes me back.  Didn't he die in a
          grease fire?"
   Bart: "No, he's alive and he's so funny..."

   Also appearing as a guest in 5F10 is Janeane Garafolo who has described
   Hicks as perhaps her biggest stand-up influence.  Garafolo describes Hicks
   who never made it to the point of Seinfeld presumably partly because he
   refused to sell out (reference #2):

   "And then there's people like Bill Hicks, the late Bill Hicks, who tried to
   do something really important, and that's why he never made it to the point
   of Seinfeld or DeGeneres. He tried to do something that was so very
   important. I mean, it was my honor and my privilege to open for him. I
   opened for him a couple of times when I was younger and it was among the
   greatest stand-up experiences I could have ever retold to a tape recorder...
   Bill Hicks used to walk the room like you've never seen and for those who
   stayed and those who hear what he's saying, it's like a gift. Bill Hicks is
   giving you something. He means something. His life was not squandered. He's
   one of the most important people, in his way, in his short life he lived,
   to be a social critic, I guess, if that's what you want to call him. He was
   so important. And that's why so many people would leave, because they don't
   get it."

   Bill Hicks was not an overnight success.  He spent several years working on
   his act without making a name for himself.  Finally, as Mike Sager writes
   (reference #3):

   Frequently, after a show, Bill would go home and cry. "I suck, I'm not going
   anywhere," he'd tell Laurie. He felt that he had gained all this knowledge
   but didn't know what to do with it. "I can't feel anything," he wrote to
   Dwight. One night at the Comix Annex, Bill approached Steve Epstein. Eppy
   was a big partyer, as were the Outlaws. For many years, Bill had stayed
   clear of cigarettes, alcohol and drugs. He had always been a man on a
   mission. He never wanted to waste time. But lately, he kept wondering why
   the real geniuses of comedy-Bruce, Pryer, Carlin, Kinison--had been into
   drinking and drugs.  "I wanna get drunk," Bill told Eppy.  Twelve shots of
   tequila later, Bill stumbled out of the wings with a cigarette dangling
   from his rubbery lips. He was in a rage. "You people, you're the ones
   responsible for Gary Coleman! You're the reason why Diffrent Strokes is the
   number-one show on TV!"  Drunk, slurring, Bill was angrier than anyone had
   ever seen him. Religion, parents, television, war, fire and brimstone. It
   was as if the flood of alcohol had broken a dam inside."

   Likewise on 5F10, Krusty must go on a binge to transform into the rebel
   comedian dressed in black:

   Krusty: "I'm going to go on the bender to end all benders!"

   Krusty then proceeds to have a night on the town, drinking from boots, the
   Stanley Cup, and gasoline.

   In Rant In E Minor, the last released album of material from Bill Hicks,
   Hicks rails on Jay Leno for doing the Tonight Show and doing Doritos
   commericals.  In one of the bits, Jay Leno commits suicide on the air after
   yet another bad interview with Joey Lawrence.

   In 5F10, Krusty rails on Leno:

   Krusty: "Comedy isn't funny anymore...You've got some big chinned slob
            reading typos from the Palookaville Post!  Well, here's a headline
            for ya.  Nobody cares!"

   Jay Leno: "Hey, I washed your hair!"

   Finally, when Krusty is temporarily the rebel comedian in black, his
   material reflects Hicks's classic bits about about marketing where Bill
   says "If you're in marketing or advertising, kill yourself.":

   Krusty: "There's nothing those Madison Avenue grave robbers won't do to get
            us to buy their crap!"

   Although it is not certain or perhaps not even important who the rebel
   comedian in black was in "Last Temptation of Krust", one thing is certain.
   It was not Dennis Leary.

   I noticed the original airdate was 2/22/98.  bill left us on 2/26/94.
   Spooky.


>> Comedy Tonight!

Benjamin Robinson takes a closer look at the show's all-star line up:

   * Jay Leno:  Probably the best-known of the guest stars, Leno is the
     amiable host of "The Tonight Show."  He's generally thought of as being
     a nice guy, and his willingness to help out Krusty may have been the
     writers' comment on this reputation.  (Notice that when the other
     comedians bust on Krusty, Jay notices that the clown is in earshot, and
     tells them to quiet down.)

     Jay Leno most distinctive physical feature is his prominent chin.
     Characters on "The Simpsons" are known for not really having one, so
     "Simpsonizing" Leno must have been a real challenge for the artists. I
     think they had mixed results, personally -- he looked more like he had a
     thick neck than anything else. [I didn't notice any problems.. --hmw]

     Jay Leno, Steve Allen, and Johnny Carson have all been guest voices on
     "The Simpsons."  Think we can get Jack Paar on the phone?  We can have
     all the major "Tonight" show hosts on the show!

   * Janeane Garofalo:  Winner of the coveted "Person Whose Last Name is
     Harder to Spell than 'Groening"' Award, and also a comedienne.  She has
     kind of a cynical, world-weary style, which earned her a variety of
     roles in the movies ("Reality Bites," "The Truth About Cats and Dogs")
     and on television ("The Larry Sanders Show," "Saturday Night Live").
     Garofalo's no stranger to Fox, either; Roger Moore employed her as a
     correspondent for his irreverent "TV Nation."

   * Bruce Baum:  I remember seeing him <way> back when on "An Evening at
     the Improv," but haven't heard much from him since.  He was a prop
     comic, with unusual objects (like the inner tube and the "fish
     through the head" thing he was wearing on the show) being the basis
     for his humor.

   * Bobcat Goldthwait:  Does he really talk like that?  I guess so,
     because I never heard him sound otherwise.  Goldthwait has a rather
     bizarre act that isn't based on telling jokes so much as it is on
     watching the antics of a guy who's obviously a lunatic.  The
     "Tonight" show had him as a guest once, although I don't think it
     was during Leno's watch.  While trying to make a point on the show,
     Bobcat set fire to a chair, which put his career on hold for awhile.

     [Ondre Lombard counters, "Not necessarily.  You might've wanted to
     point out how Bobcat Goldthwait has been on `Unhappily Ever After'
     (obscure WB show) playing the divorced-but-reconciled loser Jack's
     talking bunny puppet, Floppy, ever since 1995, which is around when
     he pulled that stunt on Leno and got banned from Leno's show." --hmw]

   * Steven Wright:  Extremely laid-back entertainer who tells one-liners
     based on wordplay and common idioms.  The bit about the zebra and
     the dictionary is certainly his style.  So is this one:  "Anywhere
     is within driving distance, if you're patient enough."  Pity they
     only had enough time on the show for one joke.


>> Yiddish, Springfield style

Benjamin Robinson clears up some confusion on the vocabulary used in this
   episode:  "Plotz" means, "to explode."  Surprised?  Most people are,
   since they use it to mean "to collapse."  "Sphfitz [I have no idea how
   to spell that]" is more narrowly defined:  It means to perspire, just
   as Krusty does when he sits in that sauna thing-a-ma-bob.

>> Writer Watch

Benjamin Robinson:  For "Clown Time," writer Donick Cary got to write a
   lot of material for Jay Leno.  That's interesting because, in a
   previous life, he was a writer for rival talk show host David
   Letterman.  [What? --hmw]

   Well, I thought it was interesting.


>> That's a nice cup you've got there.

Joe Klemm explains a visual gag in tonight's episode: The cup Krusty drinks
   last is the Stanley Cup. This is the cup given to the NHL Champions each
   year. It is very possible that you can drink from it.


>> William Shakespeare drinks Kenco -- do you?

Joe Klemm explains one of Krusty's quotes: Krusty's comment on dead men in
   advertisements refers to the 1997 Oscars. In it, Jim Carrey joked about
   the bad uses of visual effects by commenting on the ads where Fred
   Astaire promotes vacuum cleaners and Bob Dole, even though he's still
   alive, promotes Visa. He ends it with him promoting Trident gum and Crest
   toothpaste with his butt.


>> The moron who threw the clock

Nathan Mulac DeHoff explains the deal with a certain joke: Kent Brockman
   mentioned "the moron who threw a clock out the window."  The punchline
   of that joke, as you probably know, is "He wanted to see time fly."


>> "Unexplainable fires"

Ben Collins shares some info on Canyonero-type vehicles: Many
   Canyonero-style sport-utility vehicles have been plagued with safety
   problems. In 1987, the reputation and popularity of the Japanese Jeep
   rip-off Suzuki Samurai was irreversibly damaged when Consumer Reports
   road tests showed a tendency to roll over in hard turns. The equally
   tippy Isuzu Trooper received similar well-deserved bad press in 1995.


>> God rest his smutty soul!

Haynes Lee explains who Redd Fox is, someone Krusty mentioned: Redd Fox
   (no relation to 20th century Fox) who became famous in tv show
   "Sanford and Son" during the 1970s was one of the racier Black
   comedians precluding Eddie Murphy.


>> Lyrics to the Canyonero song {je}

   Can you name the car with four-wheel-drive?
   Smells like a steak and seats thirty-five!
   Canyonero!  Canyonero!
   Well, it goes real slow with the hammer down.
   It's a country-fried truck endorsed by a clown.
   Canyonero!  Canyonero!
   Twelve yards long and two lanes wide,
   sixty-five tons of American pride!
   Canyonero!  Canyonero!
   Top of the line in utility sports!
   Unexplained fires are a matter for the courts.
   Canyonero!  Canyonero!
   She blinds everybody with her super-high beam.
   She a squirrel-squishin', deer-smackin' drivin' machine!
   Canyonero!  Canyonero!


>> Meta References

Benjamin Robinson shares a couple of meta references he noticed:

   - Lisa mentions that she forgot to wear socks that day.  Actually, she
     never wears socks as part of her standard outfit, so she's equally
     "forgetful" every day.  (Which is good, because you're not supposed to
     wear socks with that kind of shoe.)

   - Marge tells the kids they'll grow into their new shoes.  Bart asks,
     "When?"  (Along with most of the audience, no doubt.)  "You're both way
     overdue for a [growth] spurt," Marge answers.  Yeah, about eight years
     overdue...


>> Thoughts

- Ondre Lombard, "Lisa is smart, but eight year olds are still advancing
  through the English language.  I doubt that Lisa would know SO much
  Spanish that she'd be able to translate passages in a Spanish television
  show.  (In other words, it's another example of Lisa being made to look
  older than she actually is.)"

  [She was learning German back in "The Canine Mutiny", too, remember?  Alex
  added, "Well, then again, Bart, not a genius... hell... below normal at
  best, can speak French (see `The Crepes of Wrath'). Besides, from Lisa's
  facial expression, I think she was lying."  Counters DK, "She really was
  translating it correctly." --hmw]

- Jeremy Reaban, "This had 6 guest voices (besides regular guest Marcia
  Wallace) -- the most I've seen."

- Was Rod and Todd mentioning an evil clown a reference to Stephen King's
  "It"?


>> Life Imitates the Simpsons

- Krusty does a bad Japanese imitation right after the Nagano Olympics just
  ended.
- Homer says "Impeach Churchill" while a few weeks ago people want to do
  the same thing with Clinton.


>> Musical references

   + "Rawhide"
      - similar song in "Canyonero" ad {tr}

   + "Bubbles in the Wine" performed by the Lawrence Welk Orchestra
      - the song played under the montage of Krusty getting drunk {am}


>> Other references

   + "To An Athlete Dying Young" by A. E. Houseman [poem]
     - Krusty's quotes some of it in his resignation speech {aw}


>> Miscellaneous

- In "Virtual Springfield" (game on PC), there is a Sideshow Bob poster in
  Bart's room in the same place as the Krusty poster in this ep. You might
  call it.. ironic.

- Benjamin Robinson's chosen title for this episode is "Clown Time".

- Haynes Lee's alterna-title for this episode is "Krusty Gets Kanned".

- Jordan Eisenberg's alternate title for this episode is "Clown Time is Over".

        Canyonero!

        tied back hair pops out to the way it was in the days of "The Krusty
        the Klown Show]
Krusty: [Krusty makes lusty noises, but looks at his comedy friends, who
        look sad.] No! Take your corporate blood wagon and get the hell out!
