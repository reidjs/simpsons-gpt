Notes: TV rating bugs are still missing visually, but the correct original
       ratings for all episodes can be accessed by V-chip. Still no return of
       the production code to XDS.

       There's an odd mix of compression and expansion this season; most of
       the episode-length compression starts after the credits and ends
       shortly before the act does. Some expansion works similarly. (I wonder
       if there's a new system for this that works best with just the right
       proportions of time.)

       This season continues the trend of using the original commercial break
       placement. (13 episodes in seasons 6-9 got them, 9 in season 17, and a
       whopping 15 out of 22 in season 18!) However, as with season 17, they
       seem to be poorly chosen. HABF15 and HABF18 have special credits that
       continue from the end of Act III, but rather than getting the original
       breaks, they get a commercial right there and the regular theme
       instead of the original music. (Compare HABF01/10/12 from season 17
       and other examples in season 15.) It seems that most of the JABF
       episodes use the original breaks whether they're neeeded or not (and
       most are not), so with any luck more and more episodes will be
       treated correctly in the future. (I can't help but mention that JABF10
       has the original breaks; it doesn't have any special credits, but all
       three Fox airings showed the credits in full, and I can't figure out
       what is so special about this episode.)

Tidying up: 4/6/09: Updates to HABF15/HABF22/JABF08, from Jerry Pasnikowski.

===[ HABF15 ]================ The Mook, the Chef, the Wife, and Her Homer ===

          Bart: Let me drive, I go through yellow lights.
       % Marge: One more crack out of you, young man, and I'm showing
<0:08> %        everyone your baby pictures. [holds one up; it's Marge
       %        holding an angry toddler Bart over the toilet]
       %  Bart: [gasps] Sorry, sorry, sorry.

         Marge pulls up to Milhouse's house.


 ~~~~~    ACT II   <---->  (-0:04)   7:57 / 7:53

       * The entire act is expanded. Note the four-second cut in act III.


 ~~~~~    ACT III  <0:24>   (0:24)   6:32 / 6:56

         Michael: What do you know about being a mob boss?
           Homer: Everything!
       %                      And I learned it all from the greatest gangster
       %          film ever: Shark Tale.
       %
       % Homer, Louie, and Legs approach Moe's.
       %
<0:20> %   Louie: This guy in here owes us money.
       %   Homer: Leave 'im to me. [punches his fist into his hand, the bone
       %          cracks, he whimpers] I hurt my fist and my palm. I thought
       %          you guys were lookin' out for me! Owww, ah-hoo hoo!
       %
       % Homer enters Moe's alone. A far shot from inside as he goes in, then
         in a closer shot, the door slams, and Homer hassles Moe.

 ~~
         Moe pockets the $25 he wrangled away from Homer.
       % Establishing shot of Krustyburger. Inside, Bart leads Legs and Louie
<0:04> % through the kitchen. Squeaky-Voiced Teen is putting fries into the
       % fryer, but doesn't really notice.
                                           The three bust in on Krusty.

       ! Another note: In the original, Krusty's nose is flesh-colored (well,
       ! white) in the first shot, but by syndication it's fixed. It may have
       ! gotten fixed for the network repeats, but I forgot to check when
       ! they aired. (Update: Jerry Pasnikowski says it was fixed in those.)


 ~~~~~    ENDING   <---->   (----)   0:48 / 0:48

       % While the general trend has been toward preserving special credits
       % (and in particular the commercial breaks' placement), two episodes
       % in season 18 still get the royal screw. There's the usual break
       % before the credits here, and then the standard theme instead of the
       % original version's Godfather-style music. See HABF18.


 ==[ HABF18 ]==================================== Jazzy and the Pussycats ===

         Bart shoots balls into the Skinners' mouths,

       % Pan to show Patty giving the Heimlich to Mr. Largo, then over to the
       % other area.
         A shot of Barney and Miss Hoover, etc., before Bart laughs.

 ~~~~~    ENDING   <---->  (-0:01)   0:49 / 0:48*

       % Again, there's a break before the credits in syndication, and the
       % jazzy music in the original is replaced with the standard theme. It
       % also seems slowed down a bit, but I'm not yet sure how long the full
       % original music is. See HABF15; at least this practice may be ending.


 ==[ HABF20 ]============================== Please Homer Don't Hammer 'Em ===
         CUTS: 64 seconds     GAINED: 34 seconds      21:17 / 21:51

         Homer starts eating the gummi "log".
<0:02> % In a new shot (close up), he eats and eats.
         Marge is annoyed.

       %
       % Man 2: [throws down hammer] Ah, then let's go home.
       %
       % They walk off. Pan to the toolbox. We hear Homer:
       %
       % Homer: Maybe I can sneak home without them seeing me.
       %
       % The box shakes, then jumps... toward a cliff. It falls into a
       % ravine. Homer yells. Still crying, he pushes the door open against
       % a pipe.
       %
<1:02> % In a new scene, Skinner is walking through a dark, misty hallway at
       % school. Eerie music plays. A shadow with a top hat approaches!
       % Skinner turns around, and it's Mr. Peanut.
       %
       %   Mr. P: Are you ready to be lightly a-salted? [evil laugh]
       %
       % Mr. Peanut removes his monocle, and peanuts with bat wings fly out
       % making bat sounds and attack him. Skinner wakes up screaming in bed.
       %
       % Skinner: Oh...
       %
       % Zoom out to show Bart standing there with a peanut on a stick. He
       % makes an "offering" sound.
       %
       %    Bart: [sing-songy] Good morrrninggg!
       % Skinner: [groans]
       %    Bart: I brought you breakfast in bed!
       %
       % He motions to a garbage can swarming with flies. Skinner is
       % repulsed. Bart tips it into his bed and puts the can down.
       %
       %    Bart: Eat it!
       %
       % He throws Skinner a fork, which Skinner uses to pick up a boot.
         Later, Bart waits for him outside the Android's Dungeon.

       * During the hospital scene at the end of the episode, there actually
       * seems to be some compression instead of expansion.

                                Original couch*

 ~~~~~    OPENING  <---->   (----)   0:23 / 0:23 / 0:54

       $ The standard short opening with cockroach couch gag (repeat of
       $ HABF22) was not used in this episode's US premiere on 2/18/07. In
       $ fact, there are several other edits made to that version, all with
       $ the goal of airing a trailer for The Simpsons Movie. Global (Canada)
       $ got the episode in full even then, and subsequent Fox broadcasts
       $ were also complete. The third set of timings refers to that edited
       $ version, but cut lengths refer only to the full one. See also below.

       $ Anyway, the short Fox broadcast used the first portion of act I for
       $ its intro, up through the "Growing Up Springfield" logo and fanfare;
       $ however, it adds about 6 seconds after that: the empty playground
|-0:06|$ from the beginning, with a swing blowing in the wind, and white
       $ scribbled/handwritten credits for "created by" and "developed by" as
       $ usual. (Not as usual, though, they do not wiggle around.) The music
       $ from that fanfare continues to cover this, including some drums.


 ~~~~~    ACT I    <---->   (0:06)   6:10 / 6:16 / 5:28

       $ See above for where 48 seconds of this act went in the US premiere;
       $ other changes because of this are that there is no music (from the
       $ fanfare fading before Declan's line "What does the future hold...")
       $ in the short version, and running credits do not begin until that
       $ time. In the full and syndicated versions, they begin during
       $ Declan's introduction. They occur roughly at the same times (with
       $ the premiere being a bit behind), though after Wiggum's story begins
       $ the premiere's credits speed up a little (finally ending around the
       $ time he is massaging Quimby).

       * Compression, incidentally, does begin as soon as the credits finish
       * in syndication, and ends before Homer's reveal as a millionaire.


 ~~~~~    ACT II   <---->   (0:10)   5:40 / 5:50 / 5:50

       * Compression ends before Burns busts in.

 ~~~~~    ACT III  <---->   (0:16)   8:16 / 8:32 / 6:56

       * Compression ends about the time of the following:

       $ There are no syndication cuts, but there sure is a large cut from
       $ Fox's premiere. I am NOT going to transcribe the whole thing,
       $ because anyone with the syndication version has it all anyway.

         Marge: Oh, Homie, you make each 8-year interval better than the
                last. [premiere only: sweet music starts up during this line]

         They hug. [premiere only: both say "mmm"] [others: Marge says "mmm"]

       $ The Fox premiere actually draws out that hugging shot for just a few
       $ frames before going to black, because in all other versions, Homer
       $ opens his mouth to say his next line ("ohhh") a little earlier than
|1:36| $ that. (Marge's "mmm" may be different, too.)
       $
       $ The bulk of this scene, again, is not transcribed. It is largely
       $ composed of Homer's use of Declan's mixing board to record his song,
       $ and the payoff of Carl's theft of the time machine.

         Executive producers (screen black).
         [premiere only: sweet music continues]
         [others: slightly shorter reprise of Growing Up Springfield theme]


 ~~~~~    ENDING   <---->   (----)   0:49 / 0:49 / 0:49*

       * From what I can tell, all versions have slightly slower credits.

       $ You might also be interested to know a few things about the Fox
       $ premiere here. In typical fashion, the credits went to text after
       $ the cast, but entirely skipped the Gracie Films and Fox logos. As
       $ well, the credit for "Satan, You're My Lady" (Homer's song in the
       $ cut - music by Dan Castellaneta, lyrics by Matt Warburton) after
       $ Alf Clausen is missing in that version, though for a good reason.
       $ However, it was also missing from the full version on Fox's second
       $ broadcast (not sure about the third), at least in the text version,
       $ although it is of course in syndication. More info about this would
       $ be welcome.

 ~~~~~    ACT II   <---->  (-0:08)   5:22 / 5:14

       ! Late update! Jerry Pasnikowski alerted me to an animation change
       ! apparently made for both network repeats and synd (not sure if
       ! Global was changed). After a montage of Abe and Selma, they splash
       ! water on each other at the beach, and there is the following
       ! dialogue:

         Marge: Oh, look at Grampa and Selma frolicking in the water.
         Homer: It's not right. It's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase
                that fell out of a plane.

       ! In the original airing, these lines started on a zoom into Homer and
       ! Marge, but the animation wasn't good at that size, and the lines are
       ! thick and animation mistakes (Homer's neck and shoulder, Marge's
       ! mouth) are more visible. For the repeats, and for syndication, new
       ! animation is used; instead of a zoom, it's a straight cut when the
       ! zoom used to start, and Homer rolls his eyes at the start, though
       ! the basic staging is otherwise the same. I can't catch everything -
       ! thanks Jerry!
