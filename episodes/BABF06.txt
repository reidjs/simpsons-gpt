   [If you use these summaries to determine if you found the right capsule,
   here's a TV Guide-like synopsis:  After successfully curing his father's
   affliction, Bart becomes a faith healer to the masses.  Meanwhile, Homer
   gets ready for the his alma mater's homecoming game -- Ed.]

Blackboard:     I WILL STOP PHONING IT IN

Couch:          Sigmund Freud is sitting on a chair next to the couch.  The
                family runs toward the couch, and Homer is the first one
                there.  He lies down, and as the rest of the family watches,
                complains that he's gone crazy.

> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================

Wilson Banswell:
   ... Homer's dorm room looks exactly as before?

Sarah Culp:
   ... the congregation's laughter in the church sounded like an old TV laugh-
       track?

Don Del Grande:
   ... the letter Homer got from Springfield University listed his address as
       "742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield, USA" without a ZIP code?
   ... at the revival meeting, Ralph was there with his parents, but Martin
       wasn't?
   ... Bart says "Eat my shorts" for the first time in years?
   ... at Bart's revival meeting, Sherri and Terri seem to make identical
       movements, except that only one of them blinks?
   ... Springfield A&M is called the "Snortin' Swine" despite the fact that it
       was founded by a cow?  [Well, the mascot is a pig -- Ed.]
   ... the scoreboard says 12:31 at the opening kickoff and 4:35 at halftime?
   ... for that matter, the scoreboard doesn't say what quarter it is?
   ... for probably the first time in over ten years, somebody remembered to
       put lines every five yards apart instead of ten on a football field?

Ben Fonter:
   ... both Bart and Homer crowd-surf in this episode?  (Bart does at his
       Evangelical, and Homer does to get down out of the stadium to retrieve
       his float.)
   ... there is one lone fan still sitting in the otherwise empty stadium when
       the show ends?

Curtis Gibby:
   ... the nerds weren't referred to by name at any time during the episode?
   ... the narrow end of Cletus' tie is longer than the wide end, like he tied
       it wrong and didn't bother to fix it?
   ... even Martin and Professor Frink are dumb enough to follow Bart?

Joe Green:
   ... the shrink in the couch gag looks like Freud himself?
   ... Homer's old dorm room still has the Space Mutants poster?
   ... OFF are among the few people in Springfield who didn't know about
       Brother Faith's Revival?
   ... Professor Frink believes in faith healing?

Richard E. Green:
   ... Lenny and Carl received their Nuclear Physics degrees from Springfield
       A&M (either their bachelor's or master's, or both)?
   ... the Dean actually puts "Dean" on his mailbox?
   ... Homer never did actually get even with the Dean (so out of character,
       eh?)
   ... Edna was sitting next to Otto at the Faith show ... but Skinner was
       sitting a couple of rows back?
   ... Mr. Black (!) was at the Faith show?
   ... yet another appearance of Alison Taylor, at Bart's Faith show?
   ... Bart considers pulling a bucket off Homer's head and getting money out
       of Ralph's nose MIRACLES?
   ... all-star Softball player Ozzie Smith was in the crowd at the football
       game (look for him when they cheer when the kicker returns to the
       stadium)?

Tony Hill:
   ... triple bunk beds in the dorm room?
   ... Homer remembers his friends as "the nerds"?
   ... Dean Peterson thinks a 7-5 football season is good?
   ... Presbyterian Hospital is once again Springfield General?
   ... the cast of Brother Faith is entirely black, but hardly anyone in the
       audience is?
   ... Brother Faith's penchant for double and triple negatives?
   ... Bart's revival has the church organist from First Church of
       Springfield?

Carl Johnson:
   ... Homer sings "Aloha Oe" in two consecutive episodes?  ["Little Big Mom
       (BABF04)" aired last week in North America -- Ed.]

Joe Klemm:
   ... the coins in Ralph's nose are a dime and a quarter?
   ... Kent Brockman's nephew is one of the writers on the local news?

Haynes Lee:
   ... this episode is rated [in the USA, at least] TV-V for violence?

Jerry P.:
   ... the Dean noticed the nerds, not Homer, even when Homer hollered at him?
   ... it looks like the curtains have carrots again?
   ... the song restarts with a drum beat after Flanders says "Yes, son."?
   ... Milhouse wants to keep his date at Make-out Creek dead or alive?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... the school bullies were at Brother Faith's revival?  I didn't know they
       were so spiritual.
   ... Homer's drawing skills seem to have improved?
   ... the kicker really *should* have had his foot insured?

Evan Ross:
   ... the "Capital" University pennant at Moe's?

Benjamin Shyovitz:
   ... after the news guy says he lost his thesaurus, Kent mumbles "that's not
       all you're gonna lose"?

-  The clock tower at Springfield U says 4:10, but it's dark out.  (No, they
   DIDN'T go there at 410 AM!)  {reg}

+  The sign there says "if you can read this, you've been accepted", but it's
   obvious that Homer could have read it, but was originally denied enrollment
   there.  [Sam Bell responds, "It wasn't in original college ep.  Winner of
   motto contest possibly?" -- Ed.]  {reg}

=  One of Marge's pearls in the dorm-make-out scene was incredibly large.
   {cj}

*  Last season, Springfield University played 12 games.  Unless it's a NCAA
   Division I-A football school (which I doubt), the only way that is possible
   is if it qualified for a post-season tournament, which doesn't sound likely
   if they have to roust the alumni for money.  {ddg}

*  The nerd mentioning his computer has 512 shades of red seems to imply they
   should use his computer to have a wider variety of reds, but if the Dean's
   computer has fewer reds, it won't matter anyway.  {jp}

+  Homer was wearing a hat when the bucket fell on his head, but it wasn't
   shown in the X-Ray or when the bucket was removed.  {th2}

*  If you look at the X-ray, the bucket appears to be stuck around Homer's
   forehead, so they could have just removed the part of the bucket below
   that.  {ddg}

*  Why didn't Dr. Hibbert just use terror sweat to get the bucket off Homer's
   head?  {mm}

=  The holes that Bart drills into Homer are much lower than where they are
   shown in the later scenes.  {reg}

*  When Homer was driving with the bucket on his head, the line down the
   center of the road meaning there would be no traffic driving towards him
   unless the entire family let him turn down a one way street the wrong way.
   {ds}

c  Audio:  (Homer) Ok, that wasn't the bucket's fault.  Captioning:  Stupid
   Ford.  [See "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]  {tpl}

*  Just how many events are there where pretty much everybody but the Simpsons
   know are there, but the Simpsons themselves have no idea that it's taking
   place?  [A lot, apparently -- Ed.]  {ddg}

c  According to captions, Brother Faith's announcer says "Pray for the healing
   love of Brother Faith."  We don't hear "pray."  Maybe this was removed
   since it sounded similar to Bart's intro "Put your souls together ..."
   which was not captioned.  {jp}

=  The Faith show had TWO Ruth Powers at it - one of them was sitting on the
   aisle with a blue blazer and the other one could be seen right after Homer
   gets the bucket off, wearing the more traditional red scarf and lavender
   sweater.  {reg}

*  How did Brother Faith know that Bart is Homer's son?  {jp}

*  The holes in Brother Faith's pet carrier are larger than the snakes, which
   would allow them to escape.  {cg}

-  Brother Faith's eyebrows disappear when he says "God's angle."  {jp}

*  Yes, heat would make the metal expand, but it was the glue that made it
   stick -- and if it really was super glue, heat wouldn't loosen it.  [See
   "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]  {ddg}

=  The revival tent was much too small to fit over a house.  But when they
   panned to the church, the church wasn't much bigger.  {th}

=  The shape of the tent changes and the hole appears.  {jp}

+  According to this episode, the Springfield church is four houses away from
   742 Evergreen Terrace (and according to AABF22 it is also across the street
   from the Elementary school), so why is it that OFF always needs to drive
   there, and when they do it takes some time?  {reg}

+  Since when do Sherri and Terri want to help Bart (one of them supposedly
   has a crush on him ... but they've never helped him with anything before)
   {reg}

=  Reverend Lovejoy's guitar isn't connected to anything, yet it sounds like
   it's hooked up to an amplifier.  {ddg}

=  After Prof. Frink's line in the song, Sherri and Terri are heard singing,
   but their mouths don't move.  {jp}

+  When Bart is seen through the tent, he still has his cape on.  {er}

*  Milhouse should have known his vision was still bad.  {jp}

=  The driver of the truck that hits Milhouse gets out of the right side of
   the truck immediately after stopping.  In the previous shot, he's shown on
   the left.  {cg}

=  The whites in Milhouse's eyes appear only right after the accident.  {ddg}

-  The numbers on the far side of the football field appear rightside-up, but
   they should appear upside-down (they should face the side of the field
   they're next to).  {ddg}

-  There are various shots of Springfield A&M fans who have the wrong facial
   expressions, e.g. sad when it looks like the field goal will miss, happy
   when SU wins, etc.  {cg}

*  The physics of the game's final kick are wrong.  [See "Comments" section
   for more -- Ed.]  {jp}

*  According to the rulebook, Springfield U. actually LOST the game.  [See
   "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]  {ddg}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Wilson Banswell:  They must have made this episode five years ago, and only
   now it has turned up.  I mean there was actual continuity between two
   episodes.  Anyway, Homer and Bart's characterization was great.  Liked
   Brother Faith as well.  There weren't too many jokes as last week's
   crap-o-rama, but than again quality over quantity. Can't believe Homer
   returned to college; that was great.  Stupid ending prevents really takes
   away from the episode.  (B)

Nate Birch:  What the heck has Frank Mula been doing?  From checking credits,
   he's been with the show since almost the beginning, but hasn't written an
   ep since season four?  It's about time he got off his can, because for
   season 11 this was pretty good.  The first act is great, very funny and
   leads into the main plot very well, even if it's just a retread of "Homer
   goes to college".  The second act where Bart thinks he's a faith healer is
   good too, as it's very funny in parts, but without being too preachy, I
   thought it might end up being more like "Lisa the skeptic". The final act
   was a bit of a letdown though, as Bart's storyline was never really
   resolved, and the big sports game finale seemed tacked on, and I found the
   flying leg a bit too much.  A pretty good ep with well done animation, it's
   good for a ...  (B+)

Sarah Culp:  Very mediocre, a few chuckles here and there, but it was
   definitely not a high point for the series, or even the season.  The song
   wasn't good enough to save it.  (C-)

Don Del Grande:  This was a funny episode (and despite what half of ATS is
   going to claim, the song did NOT ruin the episode), but the "Bart uses his
   power for a happy ending" ending caused it to drop off -- and the sudden
   ending only made it worse.  (B)

Ben Fonter:  I didn't like this episode too much.  There were a few good
   jokes, and while the song wasn't in a great key, I loved the lyrics. The
   Reverend Lovejoy killing the guitar bit was great, and the leg was just
   sick.  I was glad to find two subplots tied together for the first time
   since lord knows when.  Maybe the writers are finally paying attention to
   the great ideas being harvested by the regulars at ATS. But then again,
   maybe they just screwed up.  I enjoyed seeing the lone fan sitting in the
   stands at the end of the game (fell asleep??). Unfortunately, it just
   wasn't written well enough to make my grade.  (C+)

Curtis Gibby:  A pretty good episode, with nothing overly wacky to drag down
   the plot. The characterizations were dead on.  ("I would think he would
   want to *limit* my power.")  The first two acts were gold, even the musical
   number, but the ending was somewhat of a disappointment.  (The whole Bart
   plot in the third act was unpleasant for me, but I liked Homer's float.)
   Overall, one of the best this season, mostly because of its more serious
   nature.  (A-)

Joe Green:  A very funny episode at times, as shown by moments like Dr.
   Hibbert's "traumedies".  On the other hand, the unnecessarily grotesque
   ending took it down a notch.  (B-)

Tony Hill:  This was certainly a different Simpsons experience.  The plot was
   somewhat reminiscent of "Bart's Inner Child," although it's certainly an
   improvement.  I think we had the first masturbation reference in a long
   time.  The leg gag seems like it belongs on "South Park," and did they
   really reduce the Pauline epistles to a chain letter?  (B-)

Carl Johnson:  "The Simpsons" hasn't produced this kind of show in years,
   making it the most welcome episode since season ten began.  Oh sure, the
   story was a wreck, and the jokes weren't great, but this was very
   well-written, the kind of show that improves with each repeated viewing.
   Call me an old-fashioned sophomoric boor, if you will, but I would rather
   see a restrained but detailed show like this, than a wacky, wild mess that
   makes me laugh.  "Faith Off" is comparable to the tepid parts of seasons
   past, but in terms of execution, it is the best episode this season.  (C+)

Darrel Jones:  An absolutely excellent episode!  Best of the season so far.
   The couch gag was sheer brilliance, and "Testify" is the best musical
   production number in some time.  Excellent jokes throughout.  A perfect
   10/10  (A+)

Haynes Lee:  Religious plot was weak  and the ending was completely ruined by
   a particularly gross ending. It seems that Dr. Nick has more medical ethics
   than Dr. Hibbert.  (D+)

Andrew Levine:  To echo Carl last week, I am speechless beyond speech.  This
   didn't feel like a Season 11 episode.  This felt like a Season *5* episode.
   I can't remember the last time I saw as many clever spoofs of clichés in
   one show -- I think it was sometime in 1995.  There was a strong
   (non-wacky) subplot, a strong main plot, and they came together well at
   both the beginning and the end.  The characterization of Bart and Homer was
   so good it was frightening (except for the latter's sowing salt).  The only
   real fault was that the satire could have been more incisive.  But this was
   still the best episode since "Homer vs. the 18th Amendment."  I may not
   have faith in god like Bart does, but I have had my own revival of faith in
   the writing staff.  (A-)

Ondre Lombard:  This episode was a funny romp sandwiched between two very weak
   beginnings and ends.  While I genuinely enjoyed parts of Homer's disaster
   with the bucket, I found the college stuff to be a pointless launching pad
   of tired and rehashed cliches the show has abused far too often: nerds,
   nerds and pornography, and Homer pulling a stupid stunt.  In the end, a
   better way of arriving at the main plot probably could've been done.  And
   the ending (basically everything after act three begins) was the forfeiture
   of direction, point and meaning for a valueless, tasteless, blind lurch in
   a dark forest of ridiculousness.  [...] "Faith Off" is one of the greatest
   examples of blown potential since "'Round Springfield."  (C)

Patrick McGovern:  For about 21 minutes, this was the best episode since "The
   Mysterious Voyage of Homer".  The plot was pitch perfect.  The character
   development was well-handled and believable.  Don Cheadle played Brother
   Faith very well.  And as far as musical numbers go, "Testify" is one of the
   better ones.  But how do we end this?  Why, throw in the mob and a bloody
   flying limb, of course.  This was so close to sealing *MY* Faith revival in
   OFF-but the ending just didn't click. Still, this gets a great grade based
   on 2 1/2 near-perfect acts.  (A-)

Michael Nussair:  Tonight's episode was okay, I thought.  It had a few funny
   parts (Lib? ... I see the light!  It burns!), but not really enough ...
   The song was pretty good, and it was certainly entertaining throughout ...
   But quite a few of the jokes fell flat, and that thing at the end with the
   severed leg was pretty stupid.  And what was the deal with the Dean?  Maybe
   I'm just stupid, but that wasn't the dean *I* remember! Overall, not one of
   the better recent episodes, but not one of the worst either.  (B-)

Chris Palm:  What can I say?  I haven't enjoyed an episode this much since
   season 7. Regular Homer!  Regular Bart!  An enjoyable song!  A plot that
   made sense and flowed smoothly!  Great use of a previous episode!  Great
   gags!  Minimal wackiness!  I mean ... WOW!  I didn't even figure out until
   afterwards that this episode was by the same guy who wrote 1F07, and boy
   does it show.  Maybe I'm just giddy right now, but I'm giving "Faith Off"
   an  (A+)

Matt Rose:  I'm usually of the opinion that the Simpsons has run out of gas
   and is quite a bit tired and half-assed in its execution most of the time
   these days.  But I felt like this episode was at least decent enough to
   comment on.  I enjoyed Harry Shearer's lampooning of overblown college
   football announcer Keith Jackson.  Bart seems like the only character they
   haven't permanently screwed up.  Even the musical number didn't bother me
   very much.  I guess this is probably as good as it gets on the Simpsons
   gets these days, which is watchable, but a long way from the glory days.
   (B-)

Eric Sansoni:  What for at least half its length felt like one of the most
   promising episodes of the season, is marred by the most horrendous moment
   in the series' history.  An extended, slow-motion gore shot is a chilling
   distraction that single-handedly capsizes all the storytelling and comedic
   momentum the episode had built up.  I enjoyed many things, including the
   way the intro both concluded and led into the main plot as smoothly as in
   old episodes, Bart's character, and the most clever and lively musical
   number heard on the show in years.  But the way the episode stops cold for
   a horrific event, then ends abruptly with no satisfactory conclusion of any
   kind, shows extreme carelessness and insensitivity by the writers.  (C+)

David Sibley:  This was a pretty good episode for this season.  It had some
   funny moments.  It had some predictable moments.  Not spectacular as far as
   Simpsons goes but a definite highlight for this season.  Second only to
   "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?" in my mind.  (B+)

Jon Spratt:  I personally thought that tonight's episode was A LOT funnier
   than it sounded by reading the previews.  I laughed out loud at more than a
   couple of the jokes, and hey, they gave us a musical number.  Excellent
   episode, in my opinion.  (A-)

Yours Truly:  "Faith Off" had better plotting than usual, with the main and
   secondary plots interacting and building upon one another.  Unfortunately,
   the third act has a few too many plot elements crammed in at the last
   second.  Most of the show was at least amusing, but nothing much stood out,
   either, and a bone-chilling injury in the third act ended on a bad note.
   On the brighter side, I liked both Brother Faith's and Bart's energetic
   revival routines -- and this is from someone who normally isn't into
   song-and- dance sequences.  There's nothing wrong with this episode that a
   little faith -- and a bit of rewriting -- couldn't cure.  (B)

>> sex, lies, and the internet

Richard E. Green:  the program that Doug mentioned for downloading pr0n faster
   does actually exist ... but I've never ... actually ... used it ... myself.
   What I can tell you is that it has a built-in Usenet reader and goes
   through all groups with "sex, erotica, nude etc ..." and saves every
   attached image. Look into pretty much any newsgroup and you'll see ads for
   it ... but for whatever reason I can't remember the name of this program,
   and don't want to go find out right now


>> Foot, don't fail me now

Benjamin Robinson:  Kickers are the unsung heroes of (American) football.  In
   football, the touchdown is usually the main event, so most of the glory
   goes to the quarterbacks, running backs, and receivers who engineer them.
   The kicker is a crucial part of a winning team.  Since he is usually the
   one who scores all the field goals, and is credited with the point-after
   kick following a touchdown, he will often be the one who scores the most
   points for a team over a season.  Even so, the place kicker is sort of a
   low-key position, it's a subtly humorous point he would be the team's star
   player.

   The fact that Andre Lubchenko, the Nittany Tide's kicker, is a foreigner is
   also no coincidence.  Many kickers in the pros are people who hail from
   countries where soccer (that *other* football) is popular.

   While we're on the subject of football, people who aren't familiar with the
   game should take note:  A 7-5 record isn't much to brag about.  It's the
   equivalent of boasting a C+ average.


Wilson Banswell:  True, but now that there are a hundred and one bowls this
   year (with such classics as North Maryland State 43, Western North Dakota
   0) a 7-5 can still get you a bowl invitation.


And a final note from Benjamin Robinson:  (And for those *really* unfamiliar
   with the game, a field goal [kicking the ball through the uprights] is
   worth three points.)


>> Diff'rent Dean

Some people noticed the Dean's appearance changed radically since "Homer Goes
   to College (1F02)."  Bill McNeal explains:  The Dean that we see wasn't the
   former Pretender we saw in "Homer Goes to College."  It was a completely
   different person, and they neglect to mention that.  There's even a mention
   of Homer as "that guy who ran over the Dean five years ago," yet no
   explanation as to what happened to *that* Dean.  And the new guy is in his
   mid-fifties ...


Simon Treanor:  Well, given the Injuries that Bobby Petersen suffered, maybe
   he couldn't do the job any more.  It's hard to believe there would be a
   genuine mistake *that* sloppy.

   [Hey, we can call the new guy "Dean Humphries!" -- Ed.]


>> Geeks and formatting

Benjamin Robinson:  Using bold red letters, as one of the geeks suggest, is
   the mark of sending mail in HTML (hypertext) format.  Ironically, this is
   one thing that real-life geeks would eschew.  HTML is less efficient than
   plain text, and is not easily accepted across all platforms.  Efficiency
   and the ability to be read on all computer types without modification are
   both qualities that geeks highly prize.  They would be more like to come
   out against using formatted text than for it.


>> sex, lies, and the library

Richard E. Green:  Sex in the library is very common on college campuses, both
   from where I come from, and from what I've heard from students at other
   schools ... and for whatever reasons campus security is against the idea.
   Most college libraries are very large and have many small private "group
   work" rooms, so people who have the inconvenience of having to share a room
   often run off to these rooms.


>> Stupid Ford!

Wilson Banswell:  When Homer was driving with the bucket over his head, and
   the car fell in to the ditch, the cc read "Stupid Ford"

   It's sorta of ironic I think because Ford pulled its ads after "Beyond
   Blunderdome" for the Electra-Taurus water scene.  Now, Fox changed the line
   from "Stupid Ford" , maybe to appease Ford.


>> Believe In Power Of The Lord And He Will Cure You Of Your Leprosy!

Jeff Cross [apt name! -- Ed.]:  Faith healing is the idea that sufficient
   belief in God will cure whatever physical ailment is bothering you; it's
   one of the tenets of the Christian Scientists.  When in high school I had a
   Science & Religion class where we actually delved into faith healing and
   alternative medicine: stuff like acupuncture, reflexology, and curing
   people with simple water actually does work, but only if the patient
   believes in the treatment--in short, the placebo effect, which is
   constantly documented in any pharmaceutical commercial where they compare
   effectiveness of a drug to a group taking sugar pills instead of the
   medication.  The whole laying-upon-hands bit that the revival preacher was
   doing seems to be a rehash of Jesus' curing the lame with just a touch.


Phil Dennison clarifies:  Brother Faith has nothing to do with the Christian
   Scientists, and a lot to do with the ever-growing Fundamentalist Christian
   movement.  Such evangelists as Benny Hinn, Ernest Angley and Pat Robertson
   engage in this sort of thing on a regular basis, some more theatrical, some
   less so.  Robertson, for example, simply sits and prays on-camera and
   refers to receiving visions of people currently watching and being healed
   of various afflictions; Hinn puts on more of a stage show, with dramatic
   gestures, acrobatic, emotional reactions from the audience, even hitting
   people with his suit coat to heal them.

   Laying on of hands is an extremely important function in
   evangelical/fundamentalist churches, and occurs not only during "faith
   healings" but when blessing marriages and betrothals, praying for another's
   well-being, dedicating babies to Jesus, etc.


>> The glue may be crazy, but Homer's crazier

Benjamin Robinson:  Lisa, surprisingly, may not be any more correct about how
   Bart removed Homer's bucket than Bart was.  In "Why Things Are," Joel
   Achenbach writes, "If you accidentally Super Glue your eyelids shut (note
   use of trademarked name as a verb), wash with warm water, apply a gauze
   patch, and sit tight.  Don't try to pry it.  The eyelid will open in one to
   four days, undamaged.  According to the Loctite Corporation [makers of
   Super Glue]."  This suggests that Bart would eventually have been able to
   free his dad, whether they went to Brother Faith's revival or not.  They
   just had to wait.

   (Seriously, though, you should consult your doctor if manage to Super Glue
   something that you shouldn't have, especially if that something is a part
   of you.)


Justin Headley sees other problems:  Lisa said that the metal on the bucket
   expanded which came off of homer's head because of heat.

   1. The glue was still there, not just the metal which was stuck.

   2. Steel, which we can assume was used for the bucket, only starts to
   considerably expand at about 800 degrees, so I think homer would have felt
   that.


Joshua Miller adds:  While heat does cause metal to expand, it would cause the
   metal in the bucket to expand in all directions, not just away from his
   head.  In the same way that heat causes a wind instrument to go sharp by
   expanding into the path of air, thus constricting the air flow, heat would
   actually make the bucket tighter on Homer's head.


Ostap Bender:  Actually, it looks to me Lisa was again straining to do some
   explaining and missed a much better explanation.  The sight of all the
   stuff going on around Homer made him start perspiring.  And nothing
   dissolves glue better than human sweat (ahem ... it's more like hydraulic
   pressure than solving though).  And was a terror sweat all right!


>> Faith kicking!

Bart mentions Tae-Bo in church.  Joe Klemm tells about this exercise trend:
   One of the latest workout plans that's out in America is a program called
   Tae-Bo.  Created by Billy Banks, Tae-Bo is a hybrid of a regular exercise
   workout and a martial arts class.  Thus, you learn self-defense while you
   work out.  Currently, there are two types of Tae-Bo programs, regular and
   kick-boxing.


>> You can always fall back on your major in ... Communications!?

Tim Millard asks:  Why the crack on communications degrees anyway?  I can
   understand the crack on philosophy majors made on the show a while back,
   but I wonder what compelled the communications crack?


Seth Miller answers:  It's a very common student athlete breeze major.  I'm
   sure people who seriously take it find something of value in it though.


"Fit N Feisty":  It seems to me, that general studies/American studies, and
   undeclared are more popular majors among college athletes than
   communications.  Although it depends on the college involved,
   communications/liberal arts may be the equivalent of general/American
   studies.  Recreation/leisure studies is another popular "jock" major.

   I suspect the writers picked communications to poke fun at themselves,
   because several of them were probably majored in communications in college.


Ryan (or maybe Amy; it was a shared account) Kearns:  If you watch college
   football, when they profile the players, note how many Communications
   majors there are.


Sarah Culp thinks this may not be such a worthless major, after all:  Wouldn't
   this actually make him a good candidate for a sports-broadcasting position?


>> Block that kick!

Lubchenko's final kick was impossible, according to Jerry P.:  When playing
   ping pong, I've been told not to throw my paddle at the ball because it
   would never hit the ball over the net due to physics.  Also, it can damage
   the paddle.  Anyway, I doubt the flying foot would work either.


Seth Miller:  I'm not going to argue the real possibility of ... well ... of
   the flying foot thing ever happening, but the throwing the paddle thing
   assumes you are throwing it laterally because you can't reach to the sides.
   If you throw the paddle TOWARDS the net, you could conceivably hit the ball
   over with the flying paddle, and if you get your angles right you could
   even do it without the paddle also going sailing over the net.  Of course,
   this is explicitly illegal even if you are skillful/lucky enough to pull it
   off, the point would be your opponents.  Actually, the more analogous but
   feasible sports occurrence would be a baseball player taking a mighty
   swing, hitting a dribbler, but having his body twirl around, losing control
   of the bat, and having the bat fly through the infield and knock the ball
   forward.

   Of course, since the foot CAUGHT UP with the ball (ok now I am arguing the
   real possibility of the flying foot thing ever happening), he would have
   pretty much had to have slung his foot off AFTER kicking the ball with it,
   and almost definitely AFTER the follow through.


>> By the book

Everyone who saw this episode knows Springfield won the game (even if it was
   physically impossible).  Everyone is wrong, says Don Del Grande:  As a
   sports PA announcer who's been known to pull one too many items out of the
   rulebook, a quick look at the NCAA football rulebook (which is used in all
   college football in the USA ... as well as pretty much all football in
   Texas) says that Springfield U. actually LOST the game:

   Rule 8-3-4-1-a: "A field goal shall be scored for the kicking team if a
   drop kick or place kick passes over the crossbar between the uprights ...
   before it touches a player of the kicking team or the ground."  (This is to
   prevent someone from tapping the ball over the crossbar.)  When it touched
   the kicker's detached foot, the first kick ended, and since the second kick
   was when the ball was in the air, it became a punt.

   "But the official said it was good!"  There's more than one official out
   there; besides, a call can be changed if it was based on an incorrect
   application of the rules.  (Rule 11-2-1-b says "The referee is the sole
   authority for the score, and his decisions upon rules and other matters
   pertaining to the game are final.)

   "So all Fat Tony has to do is, er, 'talk' the referee into counting that
   last field goal and they win after all!"  You've got a point there ...


Frederic Briere suggest a possible counter-argument:  I think one could argue
   that the foot is not a player in and of itself, and therefore the rule does
   not apply ...


>> Going overboard with continuity

Michael K. Neylon says you can do this:  Last night's episode "Faith Off" had
   several references to past episodes, which in of itself is not bad, as
   continuity is not "wrecked".  But a large number of these were forced and
   in our face; specifically the Nerds from "Homer Goes to College", Lisa's
   vegan-ism from "Lisa the Vegetarian", Fat Tony, and a few others.  It
   wasn't that they were referenced, but to the extent that it seemed the
   writers were asking us "Hey, remember these stories?  Well, we'll remind
   you!  Again and again!"  This "in your face" approach to make sure that we
   "get" the joke failed on many grounds in this particular episode, but I've
   been seeing this trend for the other episodes of this season as well.

   I point to how seasons 4-7 handled continuity -- save for certain episodes
   (Any SSB one, for example), the continuity was a subtle addition -- things
   that were picked up by the DYN sections of the capsules. One good example
   is Selma's last name, which after every marriage has gotten longer, but the
   old marriages are never explicitly stated.

   Continuity is a good thing, but there's right and wrong ways to include
   this.  Good examples exist in the Simpsons as well as King of the Hill and
   Futurama.  Subtlety in humor works much better than full assault.


Eric Sansoni:  I always call them gratuitous past episode references,
   something they throw in as a "hey, remember this" as opposed to something
   that relates to the story.  E.g., discussing Sideshow Bob's past deeds in
   his eps relates to the story, but Lisa mentioning her vegetarianism all the
   time does not. They were never treated as jokes per se, but more as in-
   jokes, that fans would get but others would never notice.  Now you have
   fans saying, these references are not FUNNY in and of themselves, and
   everyone else just scratching their heads in confusion.


Chris Palm notes:  Fat Tony is a recurring character.  It's not unexpected for
   him to show up every once in a while.


A single white male adds:  I'm not sure how Fat Tony's appearance is wrecking
   continuity.  He has appeared in several episodes.  He is a recurring
   character, just like the Sea Captain and the Bumblebee guy, except with
   better lines.  Surely they don't wreck the continuity for you.  And Lisa's
   vegetarianism is a way of life from now on, just like Homer is still safety
   inspector since way back early in the first season when he got promoted.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Bless My Zinger


Brad Corsello notes that "A&M" stands for, "Agricultural and Mechanical."  Now
   you know.


Curtis Gibby contributes the next two items:  I guess it was inevitable that
   they put a psychiatrist joke in as the couch scene.

   John 2:11 reads, "This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Falilee,
   and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."


Tony Hill:  "(I've Had) The Time of My Life" written for the movie "Dirty
   Dancing" by Frank Previte, Jon DiNicola, and Donald Markowitz, was the
   Oscar-winning best song of 1987.


Andrew Levine:  When Lisa said she didn't believe, was she talking about God,
   or the faith-healing charlatanry?  Food for thought.  [My money's on the
   latter -- Ed.]

Lisa:	Bart, I hope you don't believe your own hype.
Bart:	Number of miracles performed by Bart:  Two.  Number of 
	miracles performed by Lisa:  Zero.
Lisa:	How can you believe all this mumbo-jumbo?  The bucket came 
	off Dad's head because the bright lights heated it, 
	causing the metal to expand.
Bart:	Heat makes metal expand.  Now who's talking mumbo-jumbo?
-- "Faith Off"

% In the kitchen, Homer struggles to come up with a good idea for his 
% homecoming float, but all he could think of was to create a flip-
% book cartoon of Moe dancing the hula.  Lisa suggests he try 
% something school-related, and Homer draws Superman fighting 
% Godzilla.
%
% That Sunday, Reverend Lovejoy delivers one of his powerfully boring 
% sermons.

Lovejoy:	In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul instructed 
		them to send ten copies to the Thessalonians and the 
		Ephesians.  But the Ephesians broke the chain, and 
		were punished by the ...
Bart:		I've got two words for this sermon:  [makes snoring 
		noises]
Lovejoy:	Am I boring you, Bart?
Bart:		Well, to be honest, yes.
Lovejoy:	Hey, I'm doing the best with the material I have.
Bart:		But church can be fun!  [parishioners laugh] No, 
		really, it can be a crazy party, with clouds and 
		lasers and miracles.
Homer:		And chili fries!
Bart:		A real preacher knows how to bring the Bible alive, 
		through music, and dancing, and Tae-Bo!  [jumps into 
		the aisle and begins Tae-Bo-ing]
		[parishioners cheer]
Mel:		He's kicking it old-school!
Lovejoy:	[to himself] Never give them an opening.
-- "Faith Off"

% But it's too late for second-guessing now; Bart is on a roll.  His 
% friends appropriate an exterminator's house tent to use as a site 
% for Bart's revival.  (Bart, in his infinite wisdom, instructs his 
% friends to air the tent out first.)
%
% Homer's float is taking shape in the driveway, thanks to Flanders' 
% flowers.  Ned doesn't mind the loss of the flowers so much as the 
% fact that Homer salted the earth so nothing would grow there again.
%
% Bart's revival gets underway.  Milhouse steps onstage to address the 
% sizeable crowd.

Milhouse:	Okay, Springfield!  How many of you are in horrible 
		pain?
		[crowd cheers]
		Then put your souls together for Brother Bart!
		[Bart skateboards in the tent and does a flip on to 
		the stage.  He catches the board as it falls from 
		the air]
Bart:		[holding up skateboard] Satan, eat my shorts!
		[crowd cheers again]
		[singing] I was a sinner, a real bad kid.
		What thou shalt not, I shalt did.
		Neighbor's cat I tried to neuter,
		Took a whiz on the school's computer.
Sherri + Terri:	He took a whiz, oh, yes he did.
Bart:		But now I changed, you can't deny.
		Come on up, and testify.
Sherri + Terri:	Testify, testify, come on up and testify!
Abe:		My hip's misbehavin'.  [Bart knocks his cane away] 
		Hey!
Sherri + Terri:	Testify!
Patty:		Got a nicotine cravin'.  [Bart slaps away the 
		cigarettes]
Sherri + Terri:	Testify!
Frink:		Got a cramp in my glavin.  [Bart kicks Frink's rump] 
		Oy!
Bart:		Testify!
All:		Testify!  Testify!
		[Bart dramatically holds up two lit Roman candles, 
		one in each hand.  The flames shoot off to his 
		sides]
-- "Faith Off"

% The camera pans to Bart's old church, where Lovejoy faces pews that 
% are almost empty.

Lovejoy:	Perhaps it's time to fight razzle with dazzle.
		[produces a guitar, and tries to play it, inducing 
		wicked feedback]
		Mi -- Michael row, row, rooow the boat ...
Todd:		Is he killing that guitar, Daddy?
Ned:		Yes, son.
-- Hey!  Thou shalt not kill, "Faith Off"

% Back at the revival, Bart's rousing song continues.

Milhouse:	My glasses make me look like a geek!
Bart:		[takes them off and tosses them aside] Now you'll 
		get the girls you seek!
Sherri + Terri:	We'll see you at Makeout Creek!
Crowd:		Bart's the boy of the hour,
		He's got the power.
		So raise your voice and don't be shy,
		Testi -- testi --
Crowd + Bart:	Tes ... ti ... fy!
Crowd:		Testify, testify, come on up and testify!
		[cut to a shot outside the tent.  Bart wipes his 
		forehead with a handkerchief.  Milhouse walks up]
Milhouse:	Thank you Bart for fixing my vision.  Now I see with 
		total precision.
Bart:		Song's over, Milhouse, but you're welcome.
-- Testify!  "Faith Off"

% Milhouse's precise vision leads him to the middle of the street, 
% where he tries to get a dog to come over to him.  Unfortunately, the 
% "dog" turns out to be a van.  Milhouse is immediately flattened.  
% Bart rushes over to help his friend, and Milhouse croaks out, "Bury 
% me at Makeout Creek" before falling into unconsciousness.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:27]
%
% Bart visits his friend at the hospital.  Milhouse's only evident 
% injury is a cast on his left arm.

Bart:		This is my fault.  I'm so sorry.
Milhouse:	That's okay.  You can just heal me again, right?
Bart:		Well, I don't think I can.
Milhouse:	Please?  This cast is real itchy, and I tried to 
		scratch and the fork got stuck in there and I think 
		there was some food on the fork.  [camera focuses on 
		a line of ants marching into the cast]
Bart:		Ew.  Okay, I'll see what I can do.  [lays hands on 
		the cast] Heal ... heal!  [Milhouse's heart monitor 
		flatlines, and Bart gasps]
Milhouse:	[calmly] Oh, it always does that.  Here -- [thumps 
		his chest, and the monitor resumes its normal 
		beeping pattern]
Bart:		Milhouse, I can't help you.  I am no healer.  
		[leaves]
Milhouse:	Could you tell my Mom I'm here?
-- "Faith Off"

% The local news hypes up the big game.

Brockman:	Big game fever is reaching a fever pitch as the 
		fevered rivalry between Springfield U. and 
		Springfield A&M spreads like wildfever.  [looks 
		offstage] This is writing?
Intern:		I'm sorry Uncle Kent; I lost my thesaurus.
Brockman:	[mutters] "My thesaurus" ... you'll lose more than 
		that.
		[normal voice] In preparation for the big game, 
		Springfield Stadium has caught additional seating 
		capacity fever.  [wads up the paper from which he's 
		reading in frustration] Rrrgh!
-- Bad news-writing fever, "Faith Off"

% In Moe's tavern, Homer taunts Lenny and Carl, who are A&M alumni.  
% Lenny tries a comeback, but its effectiveness is questionable.
%
% Finally, it's game day.

Whoa, Nellie, we have ourselves a barn-burner here today!  Welcome to 
the 117th dust-up between the Snortin' Swine of Springfield A&M and 
the Springfield University Nittany Tide.  Ho, ho, doctor, break out 
the hickory switch!
-- Game Announcer, "Faith Off"

% Not one to be bound by tradition, Homer has taken the tailgate 
% barbecue from it usual spot in the parking lot and moved it to the 
% stands themselves.

Homer:	Okay, who needs another lamb rack?  Lisa?  [offers her 
	some meat] Ham hock?  Tri-tip?
Lisa:	Do you have any food that wasn't brutally slaughtered?
Homer:	Well, I think the veal might've died of loneliness.
-- Cautious optimism, "Faith Off"

% Springfield U's star player gets ready to kick off.

Well, hang on to your hoop skirts, folks, because Anton Lubchenko is 
going to be kicking higher than a mule on payday.  [Lubchenko kicks 
the ball.  It is a long, high punt] Oh, land o'lakes!  Take that, 
ozone layer!
-- Game Announcer, "Faith Off"

% A&M's kick returner catches the ball, but it hits him with such 
% force that he's buried in the end zone.  Several SU players pile on.  
% Homer leaps from out of nowhere and lands on top of the pile.
%
% Lubchenko kicks a field goal for the first score of the game.

Marge:	Wow, he should have his foot insured by Lloyd's of London.
Homer:	[drunkenly] Oh, you just know what everyone should do, 
	don't you, Marge?
-- As it turns out, yeah, she does, "Faith Off"

% The sound of the referee's starter pistol signals the beginning of 
% halftime.  (The score is now SU, 18, and A&M, 7.)  Homer suddenly 
% remembers he has to drive his float.  The crowd obligingly passes 
% him down to the field.
%
% Bart and Lisa wait in a concession line somewhere in the stadium.  
% Lisa, apparently not convinced the veal died of loneliness, is 
% convinced she can get some tabouli there.  Captain McAllister sees 
% Bart, and asks if the can heal his depression.  Bart tells him that 
% he can't help him.  As the Captain retreats, Bart confides to Lisa 
% that he thought the McAllister "had it all."
%
% On the field, halftime floats and singers create a tribute to 
% halftime itself.  As the floats leave, the players retake the field.  
% Suddenly, Homer drives onto the field with his float, "A Salute to 
% Hazing."  The crowd boos this interloper, distracting Homer just 
% long enough to plow into Anton Lubchenko.  The crowd gasps in 
% horror.  Lisa looks downcast and sympathetic.  "Dad has the worst 
% luck when he's drinking."
%
% Dr. Hibbert quickly is on the scene.  When he touches Lubchenko's 
% leg, the man screams in pain.  Things look grim.  Homer looks on 
% from the sideline.

Homer:	Oh, I only wanted to show my school spirit.
	[Fat Tony walks up, and grabs Homer]
Tony:	I wagered a large sum on the performance of that scholar 
	athlete.  [produces an icepick with a laser sight, and 
	points it menacingly at Homer]
Homer:	No, wait!  I got a kid who's a miracle worker!  He'll heal 
	him up real good!
Tony:	Well he'd better, or else.
Homer:	Or else what?  [Tony holds up his weapon] Oh, right, the 
	icepick.
-- "Faith Off"

% Homer, "encouraged" by the sight of Fat Tony on the stadium's jumbo-
% vision, begs Bart to work his healing magic on the injured player.  
% Bart agrees to try.
%
% In the locker room, Dr. Hibbert gives Lubchenko his diagnosis.  
% Homer and Bart watch.

Hibbert:	Son, I'm afraid that leg is hanging by a thread.
Lubchenko:	Lubchenko must return to game!
Hibbert:	[chuckles] Your playing days are over, my friend.  
		But, you can always fall back on your degree in ... 
		[reads chart] communications!?  Oh, dear Lord!
Lubchenko:	I know!  Is phony major.  Lubchenko learn nothing.  
		Nothing!  [cries]
-- Should've majored in recreational management, "Faith Off"

% Bart asks God's help, not just for his sake, but for his father's.  
% Then he lays his hands on Lubchenko's leg and commands him to heal.
%
% Back on the field, the score is Springfield U, 18, and Springfield 
% A&M, 20.

Announcer:	Oh, doctor, with SU behind and seconds left, my 
		supply of homespun sayings is lower than a doodlebug 
		in Aunt Tilly's root cellar.  So we'll -- [Lubchenko 
		hobbles back onto the field] Oh, jumpin' 
		crawdaddies!  Is that Lubchenko coming back on the 
		field?
		[crowd cheers, and the camera cuts to Marge and
		Lisa]
Lisa:		Bart did it.  And they're going to try for a field 
		goal.
Marge:		Field goal, hmm?  [counts on her fingers] Nineteen 
		... twenty ... twenty-one [gasps] That would win the 
		game!
-- Marge Simpson, football tactician, "Faith Off"

% Springfield U. lines up, and with everybody -- the fans, Homer, 
% Bart, and Fat Tony -- watching, kicks the ball.  At first, looks 
% good, but it some becomes obvious the ball will fall short of the 
% goal post.  Suddenly, Lubchenko's foot kicks the ball again.  The 
% good news is that this extra boost gets the ball through the 
% uprights for the needed field goal.  The bad news is that the foot 
% is no longer attached to Lubchenko's body.
%
% Everyone is exultant, except Lubchenko when he realizes that half 
% his leg is missing.  In victory, Fat Tony tosses his icepick in the 
% air, and then remembers that what goes up must come down.  
% Meanwhile, on the field, SU fans pick up Lubchenko's leg as a 
% victory souvenir.

Homer:		Poor guy -- he lost his leg.
Hibbert:	Oh, no, no.  The fans will whoop it up with that leg 
		tonight -- you know, drink beer out of it and so on 
		-- but, uh, it'll turn up in the morning, and I'll 
		sew it back on.
Marge:		Will that really work?
Hibbert:	Well, I assume so -- as long as I have Bart's 
		healing powers.
Bart:		Why won't anybody listen to me?  I don't have any 
		special powers.  I am not a healer!
Hibbert:	Fine.  More money for me.
