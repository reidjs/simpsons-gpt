==============================================================================
   [TV Guide ad] Double page advertisement for episode CABF12 "New Kids on the
   Blecch":  "Bart Becomes a Pop Star!"  'N Sync is pictured with their arms
   outstretched (four fingers per hand, of course) with Bart standing in front
   saying, "A shout out to all my homies in detention."  "Guest starring:
   *NSYNC The Simpsons New!  8 PM"  {bg}

   [TV Guide] 'N Sync has a cameo as a record producer tries to create the
   next big boy band out of Milhouse, Bart, Nelson and Ralph Wiggum.  {bg}

   [TV Guide Close-Up] New Kids on the Bleech [sic] 'N Sync has a cameo in a
   rollicking spoof of the boy-band craze. The Story begins at the Springfield
   Marathon, where the winner is Bart-who sneaked onto the course just blocks
   from the finish line.  He's rescued from an angry mob by record producer
   L.T. Smash (Hank Azaria), who sees the "bad boy" as a perfect fit for the
   group he's creating.  The band is called Party Posse, and its other members
   are Milhouse, Nelson and . . . Ralph Wiggum?  After honing their moves,
   threads and " 'tudes," the quartet is a hit, even garnering post-show
   praise from 'N Sync.  But Lisa discovers something definitely out of sync
   with the Posse's first video.  TV-PG, LV  {kmc}

Couch:          The couch and TV are set up by a prison wall.  A searchlight
                pans left and right across the scene.  The family burrows
                under the ground towards the couch, leaving "tunnel mounds" in
                their wake.  They pop out of the ground, wearing striped
                prison uniforms, and jump onto the couch.  Shortly afterwards,
                the searchlight finds and locks onto the family.

> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... Ang Lee ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "The Ice Storm") directed
       Party Posse's "Drop Da Bomb" video?

Sarah Culp:
   ... the first song that Bart's group sings sounds suspiciously similar to
       "Liquid Dreams," the debut single of O-Town, the latest boy band to
       appear?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Lisa's VCR can play a video backward -- and you can hear the sound?
       (Actually, computers made it much easier to play songs backward; just
       record it as a sound file -- most sound-playing software has a "play
       backwards" function)
   ... Lt. Smash envisioned soldiers, but the plan was to get people to join
       the Navy?
   ... the carrier was "decommissioned", yet there were planes on it? (Little-
       known fact; usually planes aren't on a carrier in port if there's an
       airbase nearby.)
   ... the group was referred to as "N' Sync" in the credits, yet their "real"
       name is closer to "*NSync"?

Darrel Jones:
   ... metal-head Otto actually watched the Party Posse video?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the El Barto graffiti at the marathon starting line?
   ... this is the first time they have shown behind-the-scenes footage at the
       end of an episode?

Alie Molino:
   ... Milhouse gets a "Caesar" haircut?
   ... the members of Party Posse have deviated from the usual successful boy
       band formula of five members?
   ... during the school concert, it sounds like J.C. Chasez and Justin
       Timberlake are providing the voices for Bart and Nelson, Chris
       Kirkpatrick for Milhouse, and Lance Bass for Ralph?
   ... part of N*Sync's dance routine involves holding their noses?
   ... the little head that bounces over the words "Yvan Eht Nioj" is Ralph's,
       and he's wearing his little boy-band cap?
   ... Chris Kirkpatrick is the only member of N*Sync who is unable to
       maintain the "Matrix" dance move?
   ... "Party Posse"'s music is being enjoyed by both boys and girls, whereas
       in real life boys usually hate boy band music?  This would be good if
       the Navy is looking to recruit more women, though ...
   ... J.C. Chasez, who has written some of the songs for N*Sync's album "No
       Strings Attached," is the one who writes down the lyrics for Party
       Posse?
   ... Nelson looks disappointed when Homer says that Nelson smells?
   ... this is the first time that we have seen the voice-over artists IRL
       over the closing credits?

Sam Ribnick:
   ... the name of the production company "Classified Records" hints at its
       military nature?
   ... that Milhouse is (perhaps significantly) the only one of the four that
       seems excited about N'SYNC?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... the Australian runner dives after the trophy when Bart tosses it aside?
   ... then the mob immediately piles on him?
   ... the Party Posse drinks Evian bottled water?
   ... according to the credits, Party Posse's songs were written by Tony
       Battaglia and Tim Long?

Preston X:
   ... someone left a manhole open on a marathon route?
   ... Milhouse is drinking water but doesn't do a spit take when he sees
       N*SYNC?
   ... the N*SYNC members have earrings on both ears?
   ... the gold record on the wall of the Star Blitzzz Promotions office?
   ... the Spy Vs. Spy poster in the Mad office?
   ... one of the Mad writers is at a typewriter rather than a computer?
   ... Bart, Nelson, and Milhouse read *very* fast?
   ... Milhouse's parents do not appear in this episode, and Chief Wiggum only
       appears briefly in the beginning?

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Sarah Culp:  I liked this episode.  I didn't think the marathon was too great,
   but the show got better, for once, as it continued.  The boy-band satire
   wasn't groundbreaking by any means, but it was funny enough.  N Sync didn't
   wreck the show; they didn't add much either, but they managed to stay
   relatively inoffensive, I think, if you gave them a chance.  I even liked
   the subliminal-bit, and I loved the MAD parody, 'cause I always felt like a
   freak for thinking that MAD was rather dumb.  Besides, as an Internet nerd,
   it's nice to see the show's writers pick on someone ELSE for a change.  (B)

Don Del Grande:  Well, the Springfield Marathon bit was a little slow (hey,
   that's a joke), but it picked up with the Party Posse bit, and they didn't
   cop out with an "N Sync saves MAD Magazine" ending, but (excuse me a minute
   ... what?)  Best episode ever!  Even better than "Radio Bart", "Lisa's
   Pony", and "Treehouse of Horror II" put together!  Well, not all three but
   -- OKAY, OKAY, better than all three put together, that Navy part was
   brilliant, and this review is ABSOLUTELY unAFFECTED by the fact that (a)
   I'm a civilian Navy employee since before Matt Groening even invented the
   Simpsons and (b) there's talk of another reduction in force (civil servant
   talk for "downsizing") going around ... [Seriously: B-plus -- it started
   getting good when Party Posse started getting good ... and I've been
   working for the Navy since 1984]  (B+)

Joe Green:  This episode got off to a _very_ promising start, and a lot of the
   satire of the boy band craze was quite sharp, particularly the lyrics of
   the early songs.  Unfortunately, it went seriously downhill about halfway
   through.  Just why have the show's writers become so preoccupied with
   goofball conspiracy theories recently?  That was only funny for so long,
   and it's gotten tiresome.  (B-)

Darrel Jones:  Feh.  About average for a Simpsons ep.  Loved the marathon gags
   and the 'N Sync cameo (dumb as it was), but the main plot wasn't that
   great.  The producers should really try to get the main plot started before
   the end of Act One.  Oh, well.  7/10  (C+)

Jamie Liddell:  You'd think the Simpsons would take to boy band satire like a
   duck to water, but alas, a dumbed down, unsubtle and overly wacky South
   Park-lite approach rapidly sends this episode to the wrong side of
   "average".  [...]  The Navy conspiracy would have made an entertaining
   premise had it been handled well, but it sure as hell was not.  We are
   dragged through Lisa laboriously working out the extremely obvious Yvan Eht
   Nioj message, as if it was thought the young viewers attracted to the show
   by Nsync needed everything explained to them in slow, clear, obvious
   sentences.  [...] As soon as LT Smash puts the ship into commission New
   Kids On The Blecch makes a heroic attempt to grab the title of worst
   episode ever.  [...]  Whether this episode was attempting to appeal to the
   Nsync generation with its less intelligent, more banal delivery and its
   sub-South Park lunacy, I don't know, but whatever the reasoning behind it,
   the way this 20-minute satire was handled was not stylish, engaging or
   effective.  (C-)

Alie Molino:  I really enjoyed this episode, and I even thought N*Sync made
   good cameos, despite the cheesiness.  Consistently funny from beginning to
   end; well-written songs that are terribly evocative of the bubble-gum pop
   being put out by the Backstreet Boys, N*Sync, 98 Degrees and all those
   other clones.  A solid storyline, and, like "Tennis the Menace" [CABF07], a
   return to the successful formula of earlier seasons in which the episode
   starts off with a mini-plot that ends by leading into the main plot.
   Characterizations a little vague, but the jokes and the music more than
   make up for it.  (A+)

Michael Nusair:  The writers *could* have taken this opportunity to take a
   satirical jab at the whole manufactured-band phenomena.  But that would
   have offended their stars -- and main audience draw -- NSYNC.  That's not
   to say that there was no satire in this episode, but it was paper-thin.
   But even that doesn't even matter too much.  The real flaw in this episode
   was the singing itself.  They should have done one of two things: A) Used
   the character's actual voices, or B) made the lyrics to the songs far more
   outlandish.  As it stands, all of the songs that Bart's group sang sounded
   like plausible boy band songs, and that's a bad thing.  Combine that with
   the fact that this episode was almost exclusively non-funny, and you've got
   yourself a 22 minutes of wasted time.  (D)

Mike Reed:  Please, someone fire Tim Long.  After CABF06 was a success, I
   thought maybe his first work (BABF09) was just a fluke, but here we go
   again ... This episode gave me that old, unpleasant feeling I had when
   Homer and Bart were chased down the street by elves.  CABF12 bases it's
   storyline on an implausible and unfunny plot that tries hard to be funny
   and mock boy bands but comes off sounding like an advertisement. It was one
   lousy, obvious joke after another with no timing or pacing observed.  I
   have no problem calling this the worst of season 12.  (D+)

Jason Rosenbaum:  WOW!  What a shocker!  Not only do NSYNC actually contribute
   to the episode, but the Simpsons were actually satirizing something!  And
   come on, the songs were pretty damn funny.  Overall, best episode of the
   season.  WORD!  (A)

Todd Willis:  This episode was far from terrible and finally featured some of
   the social commentary which the show recently had been lacking.  Act one
   and two were pretty funny, especially the segment on how the band was
   formed and their training.  The last act was pretty weak as far as the plot
   goes, but it featured some of the best jokes (I especially love LT Smash's
   dream).  Overall, not bad, but definitely not a classic.  (B-)

Fox Wolf:  The episode itself was actually really good.  The only thing that
   wiped the smile off my face was Homer's "We're not signing anything --
   except contracts!" That was pretty dumb.  But seeing Homer anxiously
   wanting to sign it canceled that one out.  A dumb line with a good
   punchline.  Is that even possible?  I give it an  (A-)

Preston X:  There were just too many things wrong with this episode.  The
   overall plot was good but needed some adjusting.  They practically wasted
   Act 1 on throwaway jokes, and then the whole rest of the episode was
   rushed.  By Act 3, almost all reality had been lost.  It's okay to
   incorporate impossibility into a story sometimes, but N*SYNC's two
   implausible appearances and the nonsensical ending were just too stupid.
   CABF12's major problem, however, was the total *characterlessness* of the
   characters.  Homer was just there cranking out lame jokes.  Lisa was
   evidently only in the episode so she could figure out the subliminal
   message, which took her way too long.  CBG wasn't funny.  Skinner wasn't
   funny.  Milhouse wasn't funny.  This episode was saved from total failure
   by an interesting plot and a few funny moments: ``Thank you, NASA!'', some
   of Ralph's lines, some of the lyrics.  (D+)

Yours Truly:  There were a couple of nice scenes, like Skinner's introduction
   of Party Posse, but most of this show had that broad, cartoon-y feel that
   probably appeals to the same demographic as listens to boy bands.  In spite
   of the hype, the final product is innocuous, and maybe even forgettable.
   While it may be entertaining for the moment it isn't destined to become a
   classic the way some more substantial episodes are.  "New Kids on the
   Blecch" is to the Simpsons what 'N Sync is to the music world.  (C+)

>> Musical References

Darrel Jones:  "No Strings Attached" by 'N Sync (2000) plays whenever the band
   enters or leaves


>> Meta-reference corner

Preston X notes:  Homer says he is "roughly" 38, a possible meta-reference to
   his different ages in different episodes.


>> Those Eternal Threads

 - Where is Springfield?

Fox Wolf:  Did anyone notice how confidently they were taking the ship back to
   Springfield? N*SYNC KNOWS WHERE SPRINGFIELD IS!  Let's send them hate mail
   until they tell us where it is!


>> Pardon me!

Benjamin Robinson explains this episode's chalkboard gag:  During his final
   days in office, former President Clinton issued a number of last-minute
   Presidential pardons.  [A pardon is sort of like a "get out of jail free"
   card, for those of you outside the U. S.] The flurry of pardons isn't than
   unusual for an outgoing President, but the recipients of them were.
   Typically the pardons go to obscure people who committed non-violent crimes
   that were considered serious at the time, but no longer seem like such a
   big deal.  Clinton's generosity, however, was extended to major-league
   embezzlers and fugitives, the most notorious of whom was Marc Rich, a man
   who fled to Switzerland and renounced his citizenship to avoid prosecution.
   The common thread was that the pardoned had influential people lobbying the
   Clintons with gifts or campaign contributions.  The pardon-for- hire scheme
   struck many people, even those who defended Clinton while he was in office,
   as being a zero-class deal.  Investigations were in progress at the time
   the episode aired, and these probably inspired the blackboard punishment
   seen at the start of the show.


>> The Spice Boys

Jeff Cross:  The latest fad in music today is the boy band: four or five
   pretty boys are assembled to sing sappy dance songs about love and other
   nice things.  The target audience for these bands seems to be pre-teen
   girls and gay men.  Currently there are 5 boy bands operating today: the
   Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, 98 Degrees, 2Ge+her (formed for an MTV show), and
   O-Town (formed on the ABC show "Making the Band").  Amusingly enough, Mad
   Magazine did a gag article on how to form your own boy band a while back.


Benjamin Robinson adds:  Their music draws heavily R&B and soul, and is sung
   in polished multiple-part harmony. In performance, the band members rarely
   play instruments (a chore handled by a backup band or just by pre-recorded
   music), but instead show off elaborately choreographed dance routines.

   Boy bands tend to strongly attract a young (under 13) and female crowd, and
   just as strongly repel everyone else.  Most bands form "spontaneously" when
   a group of musicians with common artistic interests find one another.  Boy
   bands, by contrast, are calculated from the word "go."  Four or five guys
   who can sing are recruited by a producer, who then hires songwriters and
   choreographers to come up with an act.  With such a diverse crew of people
   working on one project, any artistic vision gets diluted, so that all the
   songs from all the bands all wind up sounding roughly alike.  It is this
   mechanical lack of passion that drives most of the bands' critics up the
   wall.  Kids Bart's age don't care about this, of course.  They just know
   what they like and, judging from the sales charts, they like 'N Sync and
   their ilk.


>> "Great Moments in Olympic History"

Tracey Tabata clarifies:  Jesse Owens never used starting blocks at the 1936
   Olympics.  He carried a little shovel with him and used it to dig holes in
   the track.  (He then braced his feet in the holes.)  Leni Riefenstahl shows
   this in her movie "Olympia."


Benjamin Robinson adds:  Incidentally, for part of his post-Olympic career,
   Owens staged a variety of "gimmick" races to entertain his fans.  I don't
   think he raced a zeppelin, but he did sometimes go up against a racehorse.


Back to Tracey Tabata:  Carlos Lopes won the 1984 Olympic Marathon at the age
   of 37, not age 38. His time of 2:09:21 still stands as the men's Olympic
   Marathon record.  (He also won the silver medal in the 10,000 metre run at
   the 1976 Olympics.) Contrary to what was depicted on the show, Carlos did
   not collapse on the podium.  The following year, he set a world marathon
   best of 2:07:11 at the Rotterdam Marathon.


>> Jogger To Win, Airplane To Place

Jeff Cross writes:  The scene where Jesse Owens outruns Hitler's zeppelin
   isn't that farfetched.  I was at an air show one year where, as a joke,
   they demonstrated how horrifically slow a Russian Antonov An-2 passenger
   biplane was by racing it against a man on a bicycle.  If I remember
   correctly, the plane won, although there wasn't an actual finish line for
   either of them to cross.


>> The event so nice, they named a Greek town after it!

Darrel Jones:  Marathons are long running races, a little over 26 miles in
   length.  It takes a person much stronger and healthier than Homer to run
   one.  Many US cities run one every year, and the events are frequently won
   by foreigners.  I should also add, cheating like Bart's example is fairly
   common, but usually savvy judges can discover who skipped out on the race.
   [More on this later -- Ed.]


Tracey Tabata:  Homer's -- and Comic Book Guy's -- participation in a marathon
   is not as far-fetched as it may seem.  Many marathons now accommodate
   runners who will cover the distance in 6 hours or more.

   Homer mentions "anti chafing nipple tape" as part of his marathon gear.
   There is actually such a product -- it's sold under the trade name "Nip
   Guards."  (I don't know of anyone who actually uses it.  Moleskin is
   cheaper. So are Band-Aids.)

   If Homer had actually hit the wall during the marathon, he wouldn't have
   experienced any pain -- he would have slowed down dramatically (at least a
   minute per mile) and felt the urge to stop and take a nap on the course.
   "The Wall" occurs when the body can't burn fat (for energy) as efficiently
   -- burning fat requires oxygen, which is transported via the blood.
   Unfortunately, if the runner is dehydrated as Homer (as he/she would very
   likely be in the later part of a marathon), the blood doesn't flow as
   freely.

   "The runner from Djibouti vs. the runner from Australia" -- I think the
   last time runners from either country won a major marathon was in the 1980s
   ... Ahmed Saleh from Djibouti won the bronze medal in the 1988 Olympic
   Marathon; Robert de Castella from Australia won the 1983 World
   Championships Marathon.  [Ah, but is the Springfield race a *major*
   marathon? -- Ed.]

   Did the show's writers do their research for the show by reading Runner's
   World back issues from the mid 1980s?  I was very surprised to see that
   there were no Kenyans in the Springfield Marathon.  (The Kenyans are very
   dominant in long-distance running.)

   The barefoot runner from Djibouti was most likely inspired by Abebe Bikila,
   an Ethiopian runner who won the Olympic Marathon in 1960 and 1964. He ran
   the 1960 Olympic Marathon barefoot (but he wore shoes in 1964).


>> "Bart 'wins' the Springfield Marathon"

Tracey Tabata, again:  Bart's "win" was most likely inspired by Rosie Ruiz,
   who jumped into the field of the 1980 Boston Marathon somewhere during the
   last mile, and was declared the winner of the women's race.  (She qualified
   for Boston at the previous year's New York City Marathon, when she dropped
   out of the race in Brooklyn and took the subway to the finish line, where
   she was mistakenly credited as being a finisher.)

   Unlike Bart -- or maybe even Kent Brockman (4F11) -- Rosie didn't use her
   post-marathon notoriety for personal gain.  She was convicted of forgery,
   grand larceny, and drug charges in 1982 and 1983.  In the 1990s, she was
   living a reclusive life in Florida.

   Bart's cheating may also have been inspired by Algerian Abbes Tehami, who
   had his coach run the first half of the 1991 Brussels Marathon for him.
   The ruse was discovered when officials noticed that the runner who started
   the race had a mustache ... but the runner who finished did not.


>> "You call yourself a person of differing ethnicity?"

Drew Dawg reports:  In tonight's repeat, Mr. Burns races in the marathon by
   having Mr. Smithers pull him in a rickshaw.  When this episode was first
   aired, Mr. Burns line was "You call yourself a Chinaman?"  That created a
   controversy from the Chinese American crowd that led them to change the
   line in tonight's repeat.  Mr. Burns's new line is, "You call yourself
   Chinese?"


>> Pleeeeeeaaaaaaaase Join The Army!  We'll Give You Gold!

Jeff Cross:  1998 was a historic year for the US Navy: it was the first time
   ever that they would fail to meet the year's recruiting quota.  In the wake
   of ultra-low unemployment, affordable travel prices, and a Dow Jones that
   kept setting a new high every three weeks, recruiting for the regular
   military has been severely lacking (strangely enough, National Guard and
   Reserves recruiting has been meeting their quotas) even with the Marine
   Corps' very flashy CGI-intensive commercials.  Given all this, it's
   understandable why the Navy would resort to subliminal backmasking in a boy
   band video to boost recruitment.


>> I want you!  I want you!  I want you as a new recruit!

Tom Restivo:  The "I WANT YOU" poster (seen in
   http://www.posterplanet.net/iwantyou.htm) was created by James Montgomery
   Flagg a popular recruiting tool for the US Army during WWI.

   For the Navy, Howard Chandler Christy painted a pair of recruitment posters
   depicting a woman in a sailor's uniform
   (http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/arttopic/pstr-rec/nrp-w1a.htm).  Some
   eighty-plus years later, (and despite the Lt.'s illusions), women as well
   as men are joining the Navy.

   Hmmmm ... considering the primary appeal of Boy Bands are to young girls,
   maybe the subliminal messaging *is* gender specific.


>> Wonder if the video helped his Oscar chances

Joe Klemm:  If your keeping track with the Oscars, one of the main contenders
   this year is Ang Lee.  A director from Asia, Lee is one of the main
   directors of art house films these days.  In 1995, he directed an
   adaptation of the novel "Sense and Sensibility," which starred and had the
   screenplay written by Emma Thompson.  A few years later, he directed the
   "Ice Storm."  However, if he's being asked to do a video, then it's
   probably because of his latest film, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."  An
   action-romance film from Taiwan, "Crouching Tiger" has quickly become the
   highest grossing foreign film of all-time for it's gravity-defying martial
   arts sequences, which were choreographed by the same guy behind the Matrix
   fight scenes.


>> I buried Paul

On the subject of backwards masking, Benjamin Robinson writes:  Yes, I was
   meticulous enough to try to duplicate Lisa's experiment with sound
   reversal.  She got better results than I did.  I recorded the chorus of
   "Drop Da Bomb" on my laptop and digitally reversed it.  The result sounded
   like, "joy-YEENNN-thah-nah-VEE."  If you heard it without being told what
   to listen for, you'd probably have missed the "message."  Incidentally,
   saying "Join the Navy" normally, and then reversing that, gave me something
   that sounded a bit like "Ee-nevneh Ni-OSHJ."


>> Oh, so that's what that was

So, you thought the backwards messages were the only interesting thing about
   "Drop Da Bomb"?  Paul Tomko noticed something else:  There was another part
   when the boys are singing in the jets, and one of them is using a pitch
   corrector.  Basically, this is a device that takes the signal from the
   microphone and uses the characteristic sounds of your voice, but it makes
   sure that your voice is perfectly on pitch.  It can tall what note you are
   singing, but if you are off pitch by more than a quarter tone, it goes to
   the next higher (or lower) note.  This gives that weird skipping sound,
   which is technically called a glissando. This glissando effect, which
   sounds really awful to me, is used on purpose in some recent popular songs.
   One that springs to mind is "Do You Believe in Life after Love".


>> Coming Attractions

Mike Reed transcribes the promo for this episode:  Voice-Over: It's the
   ultimate explosion of the boy bands!

   (Bart rides the cannon)

   Bart: Hello Springfield!

   (it fires)

   Bart: Ow!  Hot, hot, hot!

   Voice-Over: With help from *NSync!

   (N Sync does their dance, and closes with "a matrix."  One of the members
   falls to the ground with a thud.)


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

Don Del Grande:  There really is an aircraft carrier number 11; USS Intrepid
   was decommissioned in 1974, and is now a "floating museum" in New York
   City.  (See www.intrepidmuseum.org for details.)


Fred Mitchell via Bruce Gomes:  The show ["Total Access 24/7," on Fox Family
   Channel] captures the band in performance in Orlando, Florida, and tags
   along as they tape a Simpsons episode, giving voice to their animated alter
   egos.  That gig, says JC Chavez, gave him "brand-new respect" for those who
   do voice-over work.


Ian Pugh:  MAD Magazine already did an "Everybody Loves Raymond" spoof a few
   years before -- "Everybody Loathes Raymud".


Benjamin Robinson contributes the next two items:  Billy Crystal is a comedian
   and actor.  He's most recently known for his performances hosting the

	the nearest naval base.  Lisa shouts out of her window]
	Otto, what are you doing?
Otto:	I dunno.  I just got an urge to join the Navy.
Lisa:	You're being brainwashed!
Otto:	Yeah, probably.  Ee-van eht niojh!  [gets on the bus,
	which drives away]

% Lisa goes to warn L. T. Smash that his band is being used as a
% clandestine recruiting tool by the government.

Lisa:	L. T., thank God you're here.  The government's playing
	subliminal messages in your videos!
Smash:	Subliminal messages?  Do you have any idea of how insane
	that sounds?
	[Lisa notices an anchor tattoo on Smash's arm]
Lisa:	Is that a Navy tattoo?
Smash:	A Navy tattoo?  Do you have any idea of how insane that
	sounds?
	[an electric fan stirs up a breeze that causes Smash's
	shirt to flop open, revealing a large tattoo of a ship and
	the slogan, "I [heart] THE NAVY".  Lisa gasps.  Then she
	notices that the first period in Smash's "L. T. Smash"
	nameplate is just pasted on.  She peels it off, revealing
	"LT. Smash".
Lisa:	Lieutenant Smash?
Smash:	Yeah, that's right.  Lieutenant L. T. Smash.  [pulls off
	his crew-cut wig, revealing an even shorter crew-cut]
Lisa:	A wig!  But, but your pant legs ...
	[Smash pulls a couple of ripcords on his waistline.  His
	pant legs spread out, revealing the traditional flared
	effect that Naval uniforms have]
	Oh, how could you soil the good name of Star Blitzzz
	Promotions?
Smash:	Oh, come on, Lisa, we've always used pop stars to recruit
	people, going back to Elvis [shows Lisa a picture of
	Elvis's Army days].  Then there was Sgt. Pepper's [show
	the Beatles, in Sgt. Pepper uniforms, attacking a dummy],
	The Captain and Tenille, and the KISS Army.
Lisa:	But you have recruiting ads on TV.  Why do you need
	subliminal messages?
Smash:	It's a three-pronged attack.  Subliminal, liminal, and
	superliminal.
Lisa:	Superliminal?
Smash:	I'll show you.  [opens the window, and shouts at Lenny and
	Carl, who are standing on the corner] Hey, you!  Join the
	Navy!
Carl:	Uh, yeah, all right.
Lenny:	I'm in.
-- Different strokes for different folks, "New Kids on the Blecch"

% "Well, know that you know," Smash says ominously, "I'm afraid I
% can't let you leave."  But Lisa has already left.
%
% She may be able to spread the news, but getting people to believe it
% is harder.  Marge suspects that Lisa is just jealous.  Homer says
% playfully, "Here comes the jealousy bug" and mock-attacks Lisa, but
% she rebuffs him.  Homer wants to go home, but Marge insists that
% they go to Bart's concert, as planned.
%
% Fitting in with the Naval theme, the show is being held on a
% decommissioned aircraft carrier.
%
% Smash is the emcee, and introduces the Party Posse.

Smash:		Good afternoon, and welcome to the USS Sea Spanker.
		Are you ready to tear it up?  [audience cheers]
		I can't hear you.  [audience cheers louder]
		Do you maggots want to see a show, or not?
		[audience is confused] Uh, I mean, uh, uh, here they
		are -- the Party Posse!  [audience cheers, and the
		music begins]
		[a radar dish spins around, revealing Milhouse.  He
		jumps onto the stage]
Milhouse:	Had a girl in every port,
		from here to Barcelona,
		[Nelson uses a net to slingshot himself onto the
		stage]
Nelson:		But now I got to Springfield,
		and girl, I'm gonna phone ya.
		[Ralph parachutes in]
Ralph:		I've stormed a lot of beaches,
		but you're the one that I miss,
		[Bart straddles a large battleship gun]
Bart:		Let's get back together, girl,
		Let's re-enlist.  [the gun fires]
		[speaking] Ow!  Hot, hot, hot!
		[he slides off the gun onto the stage]
Posse:		So sign me up, for a hitch of love,
		Recruit my heart; four sweet years of love.
-- "New Kids on the Blecch"

% Bart asks everyone to "ball-walk," and the audience does so.  In Lt.
% Smash's mind the children, dancing in unison, turn into soldiers
% marching in formation.  They do battle with hippies riding a giant
% praying mantis.  The hippies, shouting anti-American slogans, fire
% flowers back at the soldiers.  One man takes a hit.
%
% One of Smash's superior officers jolts him back to reality.

Admiral:	Lieutenant!  Lt. Smash!
Smash:		Oh, Admiral.
Admiral:	That hippie fantasy again?
Smash:		They're getting less frequent, sir.
Admiral:	Excellent.  [the two men walk onto the bridge of the
		ship.  The admiral closes the door behind them]
		Well, there's no easy way to say this.  The new
		administration is shutting down Project Boy Band.
Smash:		Shutting it down?  Permission to say that's crazy,
		sir.
Admiral:	You won't say it's crazy when you see next week's
		issue of "Mad Magazine."  [holds up an advance copy,
		which reads, "We flush the Party Posse"]
Smash:		Oh, dear God.
-- They don't care whose toes they step on, "New Kids on the Blecch"

% The Admiral goes onto say that when the magazine hits the stands,
% Party Posse "will have as much recruiting power as a wax apple."  He
% uses a pistol to throw the switch on the boys' voice-enhancement
% machine, turning it off.  In mid-song, Party Posse stops sounding
% like 'N Sync, and starts sounding like a bunch of elementary-school
% boys.  Musically challenged elementary-school boys, at that.
%
% L. T. Smash takes the pistol from the admiral, and uses the barrel
% to flip a switch re-activating the aircraft carrier.  It pulls free
% of its moorings, and the sudden motion throws the Admiral overboard.
% Most of the audience literally jumps ship.  Soon, the only people on
% board are Smash, the Posse, and Homer, who returns from the
% bathroom.

Homer:	So, what songs did I miss?
Bart:	Dad, L. T.'s gone crazy.
	[Homer looks at the ship's bridge, where Smash laughs
	maniacally]
Homer:	Yeah, that's the look.  [laughs]
-- "New Kids on the Blecch"

% The ship steams ahead to destinations unknown.

Bart:	Think he's going to do something dangerous?
Nelson:	How should I know?  Just keep loading missiles.  [loads
	one into a launcher]
Ralph:	[carrying a missile] Pop music's hard work.
-- It's not just a job, it's an adventure, "New Kids on the Blecch"

% The ship passes the Statue of Liberty, which is still not enough for
% Milhouse to figure out where he is.  Smash tells Posse what their
% designated target is:  The offices of Mad.  Homer and the boys gasp
% in horror.  "Not Mad!" says Homer, "That's our nation's largest
% mental-illness-themed humor magazine."
%
% Oblivious to the approaching danger, the writers plan their next
% witty satire.

Writer 1:	Why don't we call it, "Everyone Hates Raymond."
		[the writers laugh]
Writer 2:	Well, we stayed up all night, but it was worth it.
-- And that's how they came to be #1, "New Kids on the Blecch"

% The Party Posse realizes Smash has to be stopped.

Nelson:		We can't let L. T. blow up Mad.  Tina Brown was just
		starting to turn it around.
Milhouse:	We gotta mellow him out.
Bart:		But how?  We would need the ultimate chill-out song.
Ralph:		And fast!
		[as that music plays again, 'N Sync approaches the
		Sea Spanker in their speedboat.  It leaps in the air
		and lands on the carrier's deck]
Lance:		We heard what you said!
Joey:		Yeah, heard it old-school!
Milhouse:	It's 'N Sync!
Justin:		Can the chit-chat, Milhouse.  We got just the song
		you need to defuse this whack attack.
Joey:		Defuse it old-school!
Homer:		About time.
		[J. C. jots something down on paper, hands and hands
		it to Bart]
Milhouse:	Radical!
Nelson:		Awesome!
Ralph:		I can't read!
Nelson:		I can't sing without dancing.
J. C.:		Fine.
'N Sync:	[demonstrating the moves as they name them] Thrust,
		spin, turn.  Pivot, pout, jiggy.  Jiggy, robot, do-
		se-do.
Lance:		And close with a Matrix.  [pull that "Matrix" move
		where they hold their position in mid-air.  Chris
		falls down]
Nelson:		Nobody pouts going into a jiggy.
Milhouse:	Yeah, that's stupid.
Ralph:		I wanna twirl.
Bart:		Aw, come on, guys.  We've only got a few minutes ... 
		[missiles fly past] Uh-oh.
-- Never mind, "New Kids on the Blecch"

% The missiles blow up the Mad building.  Miraculously, no one is
% hurt.  (One guy even says he feels better.)
%
% The authorities arrive to take Smash into custody.

Smash:	Well, boys, the Party Posse is over, but at least I saved
	you from a public spoofing.
	[copies of the new "Mad" magazine float down onto the
	carrier deck]
Bart:	Aw, man, we could have been on the cover of "Mad."
Nelson:	[reading a copy] They called me, "Smellson."  Ha-ha!
	[all but Smash laugh]
Homer:	"Smellson" -- it's funny because you smell.  [laughs]
Smash:	"Smellson."  I could have thought of that.
Cop:	Sure you could have.  Off you go, now.  [they lead Smash
	away]
-- "New Kids on the Blecch"

% Meanwhile, 'N Sync convenes on the bridge of the Sea Spanker.

Justin:	You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight, at the expense
	of the U. S. Navy.
Lance:	But they're out there every day protecting us from
	Godzilla.
Chris:	And don't forget pirates!
J. C.:	And jellyfish.
Joey:	Those whack invertebrates will sting you, old-school!
Justin:	So check out the Navy for a two, or four-year hitch.
Lance:	We signed J. C. up yesterday.
J. C.:	What?  [shore police men drag away J. C.] Noooo!
-- 'N Sync practices what they preach, "New Kids on the Blecch"

% Cut to the credits, as Party Posse's backup singers sing an
% inspiring refrain of "Join the Navy."
%
% It may be the end of the third act, but not the end of the fun, for
% now we get to see 'N Sync recording their lines and goofing around
% in the studio.

Milhouse:	It's 'N Sync!
		[Chris plays the "Simpson" theme on what I guess is
		a pitch-pipe.  The people in the studio laugh]
Justin:		I can't believe I'm meeting Milhouse.
Joey:		Yeah, heard it old-school!  [laughs]
J. C.:		Noooo!
Lance:		Bart was so cool.  Real short.  He's about this
		tall.  [makes a gesture to indicate someone really
		short]
Bart:		Don't print that.
		[more pitch-pipe playing.  The people in the room
		applaud as he finishes up]
Justin:		Word.  It just sounds like something I would say.
