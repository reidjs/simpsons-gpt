==============================================================================
> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Blackboard:     None due to shortened intro

Couch:          A large bush sits where the family should be on the couch.  A
                landscape worker comes by and quickly shapes the bush into a
                topiary version of the Simpsons.

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... Maggie sings along (or at least lip-syncs) with the rest of the family
       on the drive home?

Don Del Grande:
   ... the music used in the first scene is from the Halloween Specials?
   ... "Gallip-opoly" had "Rich Uncle Pennybags" dressed in a WWI uniform?
       (Gallipoli was a WWI campaign, mainly involving Australian troops
       invading what is now Turkey)
   ... the Springfield Shopper is back to 25 cents?
   ... apparently somebody on the writing staff went to California? (Who else
       would rag on Stanford that much?)
   ... when everybody sings "We Are Family", Maggie sings as well?

Alex Foley:
   ... this was the first time they cut the opening since 5F22, the first time
       in almost 3 1/2 years?
   ... Dr. Hibbert was not at the Republican Party meeting, unlike in 2F02?
   ... Kent Brockman only refers to the administration and not Bush by name
       (perhaps fear by the OFF writers of backlash after the events of 9/11)?

Joe Green:
   ... the Star Wars Monopoly box shows Chewbacca running?
   ... the Edna-Krabopoly box show Edna wearing fishnet stockings?

Tony Hill:
   ... Marge calling them floozies to their faces?
   ... Amber and Abe having a church wedding?

Chad Lehman:
   ... the antenna ball during the couch gag makes HedgeBart look as if he's
       wearing a monocle?
   ... Col. Tex's name plate says "Rich Texan"?
   ... the (ahem) "foilage" depicted on the Rastamon-opoly box?
   ... the tree Homer knocks down looks exactly like the Stanford Cardinal
       symbol?  (coincidence, in an episode with a Stanford slam?)
   ... a man looking like Jimmy the Scumbag speaks?
   ... his voice sounds like the Estonian midget's?
   ... his last name is Johansen?  (So; if that _was_ "Jimmy the Scumbag", his
       name would be "Jimmy Johansen"?)
   ... Bart wears his "commercial" blue shirt?
   ... snowcapped Mt. Rainier (Mt. Hood?), conspicuous in several shots?
       (Don't shoot me, in case this starts up another endless "Where is
       Springfield" debate)
   ... "Cigarette Aficionado" magazine, with the blindfolded man and firing
       squad on the cover?
   ... Rev. Lovejoy actually agrees to marry Amber and Grampa?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... all of the identical red dresses in Lisa's closet?
   ... either Lisa has no negative behavior patterns, or Gabriel forgot to
       mention them at the summit in the woods?
   ... Maggie loses her pacifier when she gasps at Amber's wedding video?
   ... Jane Kaczmarek is back as Judge Harm?

*  Unless the Simpsons had special house rules, you can't have more than one
   hotel (or four houses) on one property.  [See "Comments" section for more -
   - Ed.]

-  The Marvin Gardens group is shown as orange?  (in the actual game, it's
   yellow)

*  The police call was answered on an ordinary desk phone, with no ANI
   (automatic number identification), so how did Wiggum know where to go?

   air pollution, minutes later the Simpsons' are camping out in a lush forest
   with pristine skies.  {ac}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Don Del Grande:  Well, it was a B-plus, even with the animation being slightly
   off (especially when Marge is serving food to Gabriel), but then it was
   "okay, this episode is over -- wait a minute, we've got about 10 minutes
   left; how about we use the time to tie up the loose ends in 'Viva Ned
   Flanders'?"  (B)

Alex Foley:  This episode was all over the place.  First it's a slam on the
   GOP, then it's OFF getting a social worker after fighting over Monopoly,
   then it's the return of the floozies from "Viva Ned Flanders".  With all
   the wandering this episode did, they should of stuck with the GOP slams or
   spread out the plot with OFF & the social worker.  With an episode that's
   all over the place like this, you need to have good jokes to carry the
   episode, alas most of the jokes fell flat.  My biggest beef was with Homer,
   who was just as stupid as he was in the Mike Scully era.  Didn't they
   promise that he wouldn't be as stupid?  So far the Al Jean era is off to
   weak start.  (C-)

Joe Green:  Bleah.  Although I've been generally impressed by Season 13 so
   far, this one was practically a textbook example of how NOT to write a
   "Simpsons" episode. It started out with what could be the most heavy-handed
   political "satire" I've ever seen (Remember that THOH episode where one of
   the tombstones was labeled "Subtle Political Satire"?  How prophetic that
   now seems ...) and then "progressed" to ludicrous plot devices,
   over-the-top gags about OFF being a super-dysfunctional family (which, in
   my opinion, make a mockery out of the rich development these characters
   have experienced over the years) and a big chunk of the plot that was
   openly lifted from a previous episode ("Viva Ned Flanders", obviously).
   Let's just say I've seen better.  (F)

Tony Hill:  This episode was plenty funny, but a lot of the humor doesn't jibe
   with continuity.  OFF has worked as a team many, many times.  And Bart has
   driven cars many times, and Marge knew about it.  The transition from the
   first plot to the second was very awkward.  The swipe at Mormons was just a
   cheap shot.  I give it a  (B-)

Darrel Jones:  Another delightfully off-beat one from Al Jean & co. Everything
   about the environmental degradation in Act One reeked of ridiculously
   cartoonish super-villainy, but after that, the wackiness was more tight and
   fun.  I liked the almost detached manner in which the waitresses were
   seamlessly attached, and it was worth it for the huddle of cougars and
   vultures [wolves, actually -- Ed.] alone.  I give it 8/10  (B+)

Yours Truly:  This show goes all over the map in terms of plot, and the result
   is an uneven but promising episode.  The environmental satire at the start
   is too heavy-handed for its own good, but a strong second act and a
   cast-against-type performance from Delroy Lindo lift the second act.  The
   final part of the show loses some comedic steam, but at least the ending is
   well wrapped up.  Good potential here, even if the show doesn't quite
   capitalize on it.  (B)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B- (2.59)   Std Dev.: 1.1230   (8 reviews computed)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Musical Reference

Joe Green:  "We Are Family" by Sister Sledge -- OFF sings this while driving
   home from the woods.

   "Band on the Run" by Paul McCartney and -- Gabriel listens to this (and
   sings along) while riding with OFF Wings.  [It's a hit from 1973, according
   to {th} -- Ed.]


Benjamin Robinson adds:  Interestingly, his CD starts playing near the end of
   the song.


>> Meta-Reference corner

Benjamin Robinson:  Marge says the family has had "about 280" adventures
   together, referring to the approximate number of "Simpsons" episodes in
   circulation.

   Soon after, Lisa says, "Could this be the end of our series?"  The meta-
   reference aspect of this should be self-evident.


Tony Hill:  [Bart says,] "We had a good run."


>> Forty more years!  Forty more years!

Tony Hill:  Strom Thurmond, who is approaching 100 years old [at the time this
   was written -- Ed.], has served as a U.S. Senator from South Carolina since
   December 24, 1954, except for a seven-month period in 1956 during which he
   resigned and was then elected to fill the vacancy caused by his own
   resignation.


>> Ralph Nader, closet Republican

Michael Morbius:  It took me a moment to figure out why they'd have Nader be
   helping the Republicans.  Finally I realized it was making fun of how
   everyone kept saying during the election that if Bush won it was Nader's
   fault for taking left-wing voters away from Gore.  So as it turns out, it
   was a very clever joke.


Matt Weiner adds:  For what it's worth, Nader has never registered as a member
   of the Green Party, even while running as their Presidential nominee.


>> President Bush's second-favorite book

Joe Green:  The Necronomicon is fictitious book of black magic first imagined
   by the early 20th century horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, and was also used
   in the 1983 cult classic horror film "The Evil Dead" and its sequels, "Evil
   Dead II: Dead by Dawn" and "Army of Darkness".  Specifically, the
   incantation that Bob Dole recites (including something that sounds like
   "Nosferatu") reminded me of those heard in the Evil Dead trilogy.


>> Simpsonopoly

Joe Klemm:  In recent years, the classic game of Monopoly has received many
   different variations.  Originally, the variations involved other United
   States cites. However, these variations has grown to include Star Wars, the
   NFL, and even the Simpson TV show itself.


While we're on the subject of Monopoly, Don Del Grande writes:  For a show
   that's been cutting corners with things like looping backgrounds lately,
   they certainly got the Monopoly board accurate. (For example, when Homer
   landed on Marvin Gardens, the spaces around it had the correct names and
   colors.)


Dunc Routled has this to say about the mini-development of hotels on Bart's
   property:  From the official rules of Monopoly: "When a player has four
   houses on each property of a complete color-group, he/she may buy a hotel
   from the Bank and erect it on any property of the color-group.  He/she
   returns the four houses from that property to the Bank and pays the price
   for the hotel as shown on the Title Deed card. Only one hotel may be
   erected on any one property."

   There are so many variations from the official rules that having more than
   one hotel on a property is probably one of them.  I think that the writers
   knew about the official Monopoly rule and played up on it to show how
   blatantly Bart was cheating.


>> Funny Freezing Foam

It actually exists, according to Jeff Cross:  The police have been
   experimenting with new and creative ways to fight crime.  One of the new
   inventions is a chemical goop that you spray on a perpetrator and it
   somehow subdues them by gluing them to the ground.  It hasn't caught on too
   well, partially due to needing a solvent to dissolve the goop to transport
   the subdued perp.


>> Stigmata -- You've Seen the Movie, Now Play the Home Game!

Tom Restivo:  Stigmata refers to the mysterious, spontaneous, and unexplained
   bleeding of the palms, feet, side, and brow of certain holy and religious
   people.  This is to coincide with the wounds suffered by Christ on the
   Cross (nails in the hands and feet, sword in the side, crown o' thorns on
   the head).  The first and most notable is St. Francis of Assisi in the 13th
   Century.

   Let's just say that Bart would not be a likely candidate to have stigmata.


>> Vegas Car Watch

Joe Green:  The car the Vegas wives drive is most likely a Cadillac Eldorado
   from the mid-1970s.


>> I demand a recount!

Benjamin Robinson writes:  Desperate to stay in the house, Homer warns Marge
   that throwing him out will cause a miscount in the census.  Marge throws
   him out anyway. Perhaps she's noticed that after every census, there's
   claims that someone or other's district was under-counted.  (By law, the
   United States government must count up how many people are in each state.
   Among other things, the results are used to decide how many Representatives
   each state gets in Congress.)  What's interesting is that the Census Bureau
   releases figures saying how far off the census is.  It makes you wonder why
   they even need to bother counting if they already know the results.


>> Only in Nevada.  Or possibly Massachusetts

Tony Hill writes:  It is indeed not the law in Nevada that multiple marriages
   are legal, and if Homer's marriage to Amber had been legal (which it
   wasn't), it wouldn't have been enough to get it off the books simply by
   Amber marrying Abe.  But if the marriage had been legal, the judge was
   correct in extending "full faith and credit" to it, as required by Article
   IV, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution.


>> For the floozy who has everything

Ken Roberts explains:  RU-486 (Mifeprex in the US) is not a "morning after"
   pill, rather a combination of pills [1] that can be used to chemically
   induce abortion up to 7 weeks.  It is *not* used before a pregnancy is
   detected.

   One would think that a dedicated floozy like Amber would simply use a birth
   control pill on a daily basis rather than a "morning after" pill, since
   it'd be much cheaper that way.

   [1] Mifepristone, which blocks progesterone causing the lining of the
   uterus breaks down, ending the pregnancy, and (in the US) Misoprostol,
   which, taken two days later, is causes the uterus to contract and empty.


>> Everyone's a writer

Eric Perlin gets creative:  The episode of January 6, 2001 seemed to recall a
   record number of previous episodes, including at least three of the
   earliest episodes from the first season.  IMHO, it was probably deliberate.

   Here is my idea for another "new" episode

   Miss Hoover goes on vacation and Lisa is inspired by a substitute teacher,
   prompting Homer to write another hate letter to Mister Burns, which he must
   try to retrieve before Bart again tries to jump Springfield Gorge on his
   skateboard, this time simply to taunt Lisa, who is assigned to baby-sit him
   again.

   It's up to Marge to try to stop Bart from jumping, but a ride in a
   helicopter sparks her second nervous breakdown, prompted by her fear of
   flying.  Marge spends some time in a sanitarium with a man who thinks he's
   Michael Jackson.  Jackson advises Marge to seek treatment in a casino,
   which she does, but that ignites her gambling problem once again. Maggie
   responds to all of this by shooting Mister Burns again.

   Then, another angel fossil appears to warn everyone about another comet
   heading toward Springfield.  The comet disintegrates in the air and changes
   into a hurricane, which again destroys Flanders' house.

   The wounded Mister Burns discovers who shot him, and responds by firing
   Homer again, who in turn spends his spare time becoming Springfield's
   safety advocate.  In order to be taken seriously as a safety advocate,
   Homer buys a hair tonic to finally grow some hair.  In order to pay for the
   hair tonic, Homer again takes a job as a department store Santa Claus.

   Is that convoluted enough? :)


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Joe Green alterna-title for this episode is:  Viva Ned Flanders 2:
   Electric Boogaloo


Tony Hill:  "Singin' in the Rain" was written by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb
   Brown for the film "Hollywood Revue of 1929."

   How many times has Marge said "This is the worst thing you've ever done"?
   I think she said it only a few weeks ago when Homer's rocket set the church
   on fire.


Benjamin Robinson:  Anti-goof:  The animators remembered to keep Bart's
   driving gloves on when they cut from him putting them on to him driving the
   car.

Homer:	Why, you little ... [throttles Bart]
Marge:	Stop fighting!  [throttles Homer]
Lisa:	Mom, that's not how you pry them apart!  [grabs Bart's arm 
	and tries to pull him away from Homer]
Marge:	I've been prying them apart since before you were born!
-- Family game night at the Simpsons, "Brawl in the Family"

% Maggie grows concerned about the family's brawling.  She crawls to
% the phone and looks at the emergency speed-dialing buttons.  There's
% one for the fire department, one for the medics, and one for family
% fights, which even looks like Homer strangling Bart.  This is the
% one she chooses.
%
% Meanwhile, at the police department, Chief Wiggum, Eddie, and Lou
% face a lineup of prisoners.

Wiggum:	Okay, everyone turn to the left.
	[four men turn left, but the fifth turns right.  They bump 
	into each other]
	Oh, come on people, the "Prison Nutcracker Suite" is one 
	week away, and I don't see five sugar plums.  I see five 
	guys who don't know their moves and don't seem to care.  
	There -- I said it!  [the phone rings]
	That better be wardrobe and it better be good news.  
	[answers the phone] Hello?  [he hears the Simpson family 
	fighting] It sounds like a domestic disturbance.  [hangs 
	up]
	[to the prisoners] All right, we'll be right back.  And 
	don't try anything, [points to one man] because Johanssen 
	there is a snitch.
	[Wiggum and the two policemen leave.  The other four 
	prisoners immediately start beating up Johanssen]
-- Watch your back, Bob Fosse, "Brawl in the Family"

% The police arrive on the scene.  The top hat token from Monopoly
% crashes through the front window, tipping the cops to the reason for
% the fight.  They decide to send in the Negotia-bot, a robot with the
% upper torso of a policewoman attached to the tank-like platform used
% for bomb-disposal robots.  The robot goes into the house and rolls
% up to the family.

I am Brenda.  I am programmed to talk in a calm and constructive 
  manner -- DESTROY!  DESTROY!
-- Brenda the police robot, "Brawl in the Family"

% Brenda calmly and constructively shoots a white substance at the
% family, which turns out to be taffy.  The entire family is trapped
% in the giant taffy ball and subdued.  Brenda drags them onto the
% front lawn.

Wiggum:	Nice work, Brenda.  I'll take it from here.
Brenda:	No way!  This is my collar!
	[Wiggum switches off Brenda's power switch, winning the 
	argument]
Wiggum:	Too bad real women don't come with these, huh?  [laughs]
Homer:	You got that right.
Wiggum:	Quiet, you.  That counts as your phone call.

% [End of Act One.  Time:  6:41]
%
% The Simpson family sits in their jail cell.  Lisa reads the paper,
% which has made their arrest front-page news.

Lisa:	Thanks a lot, everybody.  Now, I'll never get into an Ivy 
	League school.
Bart:	[taunting] You're going to Stanford, you're going to 
	Stanford ...
	[Homer joins in]
Homer
+ Bart:	You're going to Stanford!
Lisa:	Take it back!  Take it back!
Homer:	Stanford.
Marge:	This family has hit rock bottom.
-- Well, it beats Brown, "Brawl in the Family"

% As if on cue, a choral note, like the one that opens the "Simpsons"
% theme song, plays.  A man in a natty white suit approaches the
% family's cell.

Gabriel:	Hello, I'm Gabriel.
Homer:		[gasps] A heavenly choir!  You must be an angel.
Gabriel:	[laughs] No, that's my pager.  [turns it off]  I'm a 
		social worker.  I'm here to help you stop fighting, 
		and become a family again.
Homer:		No, you are an angel, like Denzel Washington in "The 
		Preacher's Wife," or Will Smith in "Bagger Vance," 
		or Slimer in "Ghostbusters."
Marge:		Sir, we know you're not an angel.  My husband sees 
		too many movies.
Homer:		Don't blame me -- blame Tinseltown and its second 
		golden age.  May it never end.
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Before family therapy begins in earnest, Gabriel does some field
% work, observing each family member in his or her own habitat.  He
% starts with Lisa.  Sitting at her desk, she declares that her room
% is her sanctuary, and that her family respects this.  Just then
% Bart, who has just been sprayed by a skunk, runs into her closet and
% uses some of her sweaters to clean himself up.  Lisa uses an
% executive stress ball and chants a mantra -- "Just ten more years"
% -- to keep her anger under control.
%
% Bart's next.  Some kids might be embarrassed to be trailed by a
% therapist.  Not, Bart, though.

Bart:		Attention, everyone!  This is Gabriel, my personal 
		social worker.  He has to be here -- I'm just that 
		nuts.
		[the schoolyard kids are impressed]
Milhouse:	How come you get a social worker?  I'm the one with 
		stigmata.  [holds up his bloody hands]
-- You get a part in Mel Gibson's next movie, "Brawl in the Family"

% By contrast, Marge seems to be the picture of sanity.  Gabriel eats
% a home-baked brownie.

Gabriel:	Thank you Marge.  You sure do love cooking.
Marge:		Food keeps my family happy, so I make a few practice 
		dinners before showtime.  'Cause at six o'clock, we 
		go live!
		[Gabriel looks disturbed]
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Gabriel observes Homer in his favorite place -- Moe's Tavern.

Homer:		Okay, Gabriel, this is a bar.  It's where I go to 
		drink alcohol, which is the mortal equivalent of 
		your ambrosia.
Gabriel:	Homer, I am not an angel.
Homer:		Pfft.  Well not with that temper.
		[seven beers later]
		Look, the think about my family is, there's five of 
		us:  Marge, Bart, Girl Bart, the one who doesn't 
		talk, and the fat guy.  How I loathe him.  [falls 
		off the barstool, and groans.  Gabriel jots 
		something down in his notebook, and shakes his head]
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Now that Gabriel has appraised the situation, he's able to think of
% a way to help the Simpsons.  He takes the family to a picturesque
% clearing in the woods.

Homer:		Okay, why are we in the woods?  Is this Heaven?
Gabriel:	No, Homer.  I brought you out here to shake off your 
		negative behavior patterns.  Marge, you medicate 
		your family with food.  Bart, you'll do anything for 
		attention -- cut that out!
		[cut to Bart, who is wearing a beard of bees]
Bart:		They chose me.
		[back to Gabriel]
Gabriel:	Homer, your problem is quite simple.  You're a 
		drunken, childish buffoon.
Homer:		Which is society's fault because ...
Gabriel:	It's your fault, Homer, but I've got an exercise 
		that will help all of you break out of the roles 
		you're stuck in.  Who feels like lunch?
Lisa:		Me!
Homer:		     Me!
Bart:		          Right here!
Marge:		                       Me too!
Gabriel:	Good.  I hung it at the top of that tree.  [points 
		up.  A backpack hangs from one of the top limbs of a 
		tall pine tree]
Bart:		But how are we supposed to get it?
Gabriel:	You'll just have to cooperate.
Homer:		Cooperate?  Well, this is one family that doesn't 
		swing that way.
Gabriel:	Are you sure?  I made roast beef sandwiches -- one 
		falafel --
Lisa:		Thank you.
Gabriel:	And plenty of beer.
Homer:		Give me that beer!
-- It's all in the motivation, "Brawl in the Family"

% When it comes to beer, Homer can be a downright ingenious thinker. 
% Rather than taking the obvious route of climbing to the picnic
% basket, Homer gets in the car and rams the tree.  It falls over,
% just barely missing Gabriel.  (He may not be an angel, but evidently
% they are watching over him.)  The tree slides toward a canyon,
% hooking Gabriel in its branches and dragging him over the edge.
%
% The tree bounces off the sides of the canyon a few times, before it
% becomes wedged horizontally between the two canyon walls.  Gabriel
% holds on to one of the branches, which is the only thing preventing
% him from falling hundreds of feet to the canyon floor.  He's unhurt
% -- for the moment -- but the scent of the lunch has attracted a pack
% of wolves and cougars, who gather underneath the tree.

Marge:	We've got to do something -- but what?
Homer:	Okay, family huddle.
	[the family huddles together.  Homer lowers his voice to a 
	whisper]
	Now, here's how it's going down.  As a family, we drive 
	away.  We cover for each other, as a family.  It's what 
	Gabriel would have wanted.
Lisa:	Look, we can't fall into old patterns.  We've got to think 
	of a plan.
Homer:	Okay, but talk like this.
Lisa:	[whisper] Fine, I'll talk like this.
Homer:	[normal voice] What?
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% As a family, the Simpsons devise a rescue plan.  As the rest of the
% family steadies his descent, Homer climbs down the canyon wall and
% onto the tree.  He has to move quickly, for the wolves and cougars
% have formed their own plan-making huddle.

Lisa:	Dad's on the log.  Now Mom, you get the car and pull them 
	to safety.
	[Marge runs toward the car, but trips on a tree root]
Marge:	Oh, my driving ankle!  Bart, I know this sounds crazy, but 
	do you think you can drive a car?
Bart:	[innocently] Okay, but it's my first time.
Marge:	Here's the keys.  [hands him the keys]
Bart:	I got a set.  [walks to the car and laces up a pair of 
	driving gloves]
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Bart expertly backs the car to the edge of the cliff.  Lisa ties the
% rope to the bumper, and Bart slowly drives forward, hauling up Homer
% and Gabriel.  The two men aren't out of danger yet, though.  The
% wolves and cougars know the value of teamwork, too.  They form a
% sort of "totem pole" by climbing onto one another.  Soon, they're
% close enough to swipe at Homer and Gabriel.  The social worker tells
% Homer to throw the food at the animals to distract them.

Homer:		Oh, no!  The roast beef is making them stronger -- 
		and the falafel is making them angrier!
		[the animals rig a catapult-like device, and use it 
		to launch a cougar towards the men]
Gabriel:	Give them the beer!  It will impair their motor 
		skills.
Homer:		No!  I will never -- [looks at the beer] Oh, wait, 
		it's Blatz.  [tosses it to the animals]
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% The animals bite into the cans, drink the beer, and immediately get
% wasted.
%
% With everyone safe, the family and Gabriel head home, singing
% happily.

All:	[singing to the tune of "We Are Family"]
	We are family!
Bart:	Our bitter fights are now history!
All:	We are family!
Homer:	Wolves and cougars ate our roast beef!
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Gabriel is really satisfied with the way the Simpsons have come
% together as a family.  He has truly earned his Wings ... CD.  As he
% listens to "Band on the Run," Marge reflects on how the trip to the
% woods has affected her family.

Marge:	You know, we've been through some 280 adventures together, 
	but our bond has never been stronger.
Homer:	Yep, our family is as functional as all get-out.
Lisa:	Could this be the end of our series ... of events?
-- Tonight, on self-reference theater ... "Brawl in the Family"

% The family bond is soon tested.  As they pull up to the house, two
% women are waiting in the driveway.  They are Amber and Ginger, the
% two floozies that Homer and Ned unwittingly married during their
% trip to Las Vegas.

Marge:		Can I help you?
Amber:		Yeah, I'm looking for Homer Simpson.
Homer:		Oh, it's the woman I married in Vegas!
		[everyone in the car gasps]
Gabriel:	Homer, you're a bad man, and your seed should be 
		wiped from the earth.  [to Bart and Lisa] No 
		offense, children.
		[gets out of the car]
-- They get that a lot, "Brawl in the Family"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:25]
%
% Amber and Ginger play a video of their wedding -- complete with a
% shot of Homer kissing Ned -- just in case they tried to deny the
% event ever happened.  Marge is incensed.

If I had known there were loose women in Las Vegas, I would never have 
  let you go.
-- Marge Simpson, "Brawl in the Family"

% Homer tells Marge that while he did marry Amber, he also abandoned
% her.  Strangely, Marge is not mollified.
%
% Meanwhile, Ginger settles into the Flanders household, searching the
% wall for a Murphy bed.

Ned:	Well, Ginger, sure is, um, neat that you managed to hunt 
	me down.
Ginger:	Where's the bed?
Ned:	[prays] Oh, Lord, I know my new wife is a little more ... 
	peppermint than you're used to, but, uh, I know you'd want 
	me to honor my sacred vows, so I'll ...
Ginger:	Hey, stud, where do you keep your Wet Ones?  I need to 
	shower.
Ned:	Oh, we've got a real shower upstairs.
Ginger:	Upstairs?  I hit the jackpot!
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Homer tries to reconcile with his first wife.

Homer:	So, sitting on the bed, eh?
Marge:	Get out, Homer.
Homer:	Look, I married her, but that is as far as we went.  We 
	never, ever made whoopie -- or even mouth whoopie.
Marge:	Homer, I don't know if I can ever forgive you.  Please go 
	away.
Homer:	Fair enough, but I'm going to come back with the greatest 
	gift a husband can give his wife:  An annulment from his 
	secret wife.
-- When diamonds don't quite say it, "Brawl in the Family"

% That's easier said than done, as Homer finds out in Judge Harm's
% courtroom.

Harm:	Mr. Simpson, under Nevada law, bigamy, or "Mormon hold 
	'em," is perfectly legal.  [bangs gavel] Both marriages 
	stand.
Homer:	But I only love Marge!
Harm:	I hereby order you to take care of both of your wives.  
	Bailiff -- ring him.
	[a bailiff slides a second wedding ring onto Homer's 
	finger]
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Marge kicks Homer out of the house, in spite of his protests that
% her doing so will cause a miscount in the census.  He takes up
% residence in Bart's treehouse.  Amber climbs up, bringing with her
% the makings for a pretty good midnight snack.

Homer:	Please, just leave me alone.
Amber:	Now, now, Mama's going to make you a snack.
	[starts to make Homer a sandwich]
Homer:	[gasps] Ooh!  Yeah.  That's good ... oh, don't stop ... 
	oh, yeah ... faster, faster
	[cut to Marge's bedroom.  She can overhear Homer and 
	Amber]
	Faster, faster ... ohh, you do that like a pro!
Marge:	Oh, no, she's making him a sandwich.  [covers her ears 
	with a pillow]
Homer:	Use both hands!
-- Fastest way to a man's heart, "Brawl in the Family"

% The next morning, in Ned's bedroom, Ginger gets a wake-up call when
% Ned and the kids bring her breakfast in bed.

Ned,
 Rod +
 Todd:	[singing] Rise, and shine and give God
	Your glory, glory!
Ginger:	[waking up] Huh?  Wha?  Huh?
Ned:	Me and the boys made you breakfast in bed.  It's the best 
	darn diddily way to start your first Flanders day.
Ginger:	[takes a cup of coffee from the tray] You think you could 
	Irish up this coffee for me?
Ned:	Oops, watch the swears, honey bear.  We don't use the I-
	word in this house.
Ginger:	[looks in the nightstand drawer] Where's my cigarettes?
Rod:	We flushed your sin sticks down to Hell.
Todd:	Smokers are jokers!
Rod +
 Todd:	Smokers are jokers!
Ginger:	I think I'm going to throw up!  [rushes out of the room]
Ned:	Ooh, who wants to hold mommy's hair?
Rod:	Me, me!
Todd:	I do!
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% At the Simpsons, "Vegas Mom" tries to be nice with the kids, but
% they seem resistant to her charms.
%
% At the bar, Lenny tells Homer that a man with two wives ought to
% look happier.  Carl corrects him -- it's the man with two *knives*
% who is happy.
%
% That night, Homer can't sleep with his first wife, who is too angry
% to see him, or his second, who isn't an attractive sight while
% asleep.  So, he ends up in the doghouse -- or he tries to.  His
% shoulders get stuck.  Homer panics at first, but then tries calmly
% walking around the yard.  Marge can see him from the bedroom window,
% and Homer's plight touches her.
%
% The next day, Homer wakes up next to the broken remains of the
% doghouse.

Ah, the sweet couple of seconds before I remember why I'm sleeping on 
  the lawn.
-- Homer Simpson, "Brawl in the Family"

% Marge walks up to Homer.

Marge:	Homer?
Homer:	Marge?  You're speaking to me?
Marge:	Why don't you come inside, and we'll talk.
Homer:	Talk about what?  Sports?  Bigamy?
Marge:	Bigamy.
Homer:	Not a sports fan, huh?
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% As Amber sunbathes in a wading pool on the front lawn, she can
% overhear Homer and Marge arguing.  Evidently, the talk didn't go
% entirely smoothly.  Homer angrily walks out of the house, and Marge
% tells him to take "Britney Beers" -- as she calls Amber -- with him. 
% The children, meanwhile, seem resigned to their father's leaving. 
% Homer collects Amber, and they both head to Moe's to start their new
% life together.

Homer:	My lady's glass is empty, Moe.  Bring her another 
	Cookies'N'Cream martini.
Amber:	No, honey, this time make it a Sex on the Beach -- and 
	hold the beach.  Ha!
Lenny:	Hey, Homey, your new wife is great.  Her lips look like 
	nightcrawlers.
Homer:	You know, she can put that mole anywhere on her face.
-- What a catch, "Brawl in the Family"

% Homer toasts Amber, and that's the last we see of them for the
% night.  The next morning, Amber wakes up in the treehouse.

Amber:	Ohh, my head.  Aspirin -- [she downs a bottle of pills] 
	RU-486 [downs another bottle]
	[suddenly, Abe rises up from the blankets]
Abe:	Morning, love muffin.
Amber:	Who are you?
Abe:	I'm your new husband, and that was a wedding night I'll 
	never forget.
Amber:	Oh, no!  We didn't ...
Abe:	We almost didn't, but you wouldn't take "I can't" for an 
	answer.  Wanna give Honest Abe another term in the Oval 
	Office?
Amber:	No!
Abe:	Oh, thank God.
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% Amber doesn't understand how she ended up hitched to Abe. 
% Fortunately, Homer had the nuptials videotaped for posterity.  The
% video shows Amber clearly renouncing all others to wed Abe Simpson. 
% Homer is free and clear, while Vegas Mom, in Bart's words, crapped
% out.  The family seems equally proud that their plan worked, and
% that they carried it out as a family.
%
% Meanwhile, the Flanders' saccharine ways have caused Ginger to snap. 
% She runs out of the house to meet Amber.  Both women decide to high-
% tail it back to Vegas, where they figure they can be won as prizes
% on poker games.
%
% The Simpsons exult in their victory.

Marge:	I'm so proud of us.  When we stick together, we can do 
	anything.
Abe:	Oh, I lost another wife.
Lisa:	I'm so sorry, grandpa.
Abe:	Well, it hurts now, but the senility will take care of 
	that.  [pause] There she goes.
	[to Homer] You know, I have a son about your age.
	[all laugh]
Homer:	Aw, I love that.
-- "Brawl in the Family"

% And so ends another bonding experience for America's favorite
% dysfunctional family.
