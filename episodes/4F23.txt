* If the Skinner we know is an impostor, why does he look almost exactly like
  Sheldon Skinner from 3F19?

= Tamzerian's silhouette movements are not always in sync with his head and
  mouth. {bc}

= The real Skinner's Army uniform loses details and becomes more uniform in
  color in some shots. {bc}

= The real Skinner's hair is gray and white in most scenes, and all gray or
  all white in a few. {bc}

* Considering that "Skinner" was supposed to have been a POW, why did he 
  come straight to Springfield after Skinner disappeared? {mar}

* Also, wouldn't someone have realized that "Skinner" wasn't Skinner? {mar}

* And, when he rejoined the army in [1F18] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's
  Baadassssss Song", wouldn't the army have realized that "Sgt. Skinner"
  wasn't Sgt. Skinner? {mar}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold: Ken Keeler, I hate you.  This episode is certainly a waste
   of tape. Abandoning all continuity and destroying a great supporting
   character in exchange for a few cheap laughs?  I'm sorry, that might have
   worked on "The Critic", but if you haven't noticed, this ain't "The Critic".
   The only solace is that this appears to be Keeler's final episode.
   Well, Mr. Keeler, with this episode, you have earned yourself the most
   welcome exit since Jennifer Crittenden. (F)

Jonathan Benney: This was notably bad. One of the distinguishing things about
   the show has (had?) always been the feeling that the writers had really
   lively minds; and that no matter what excesses they went to, they were
   applying a wide base of amusing thoughts & information. This was virtually
   absent here, and the really worrying bit was that no-one even seemed to be
   TRYING! The result was poor in every respect - looking like it was put
   together in a couple of hours. (F)

Ben Collins: I sincerely hope we just saw the worst episode this season. There
   was no point to the story; I didn't particularly care about what was going
   on. Most gags were completely pointless, and even the more pointed ones
   failed miserably. This, and the mindless, ridiculous ending almost
   threatened it with a failing grade, if not for the Ralph Wiggum scenes and
   Bart's badmouthing of the situation. (D+)

Nathan Mulac DeHoff: Okay, first of all, the premise was ridiculous.  Still,
   I thought they played it through pretty well.  The episode probably had the
   best part for Agnes in the series so far, Ralph was in top form, and the
   faulty logic proving that the real Skinner would make a better principal
   than the fake one was hilarious, as was the car scene.  The ending was one
   of the biggest cop-outs in the history of the show, but that was exactly
   what was funny about it. (B)

Don Del Grande: "Skinner's a fake"; "You're right; I'll leave"; "We're getting
   him back"; "I'm back"; show's over.  You never saw much of the real Skinner
   in action - then again, you never saw much action in this episode.  Period.
   (B-)

Tony Hill: This was a just plain stupid episode.  Any humor in it is stifled for
   us OFF-Heads by the total break with continuity this ep represents.  How 
   could Skinner have re-enlisted in the Army in "Baddasss" if he were 
   officially dead?  And what about his POW helmet discovered in "Homer's 
   Barbershop Quartet." (D)

John R. Hunt: Frankly, I thought the episode was a riot. Not the best ever,
   certainly, but not at all offensive -- in other words, it was no "Lemon of
   Troy." There were some hilarious moments -- what the hell is "silhouette
   night" anyway? I agree with some of the other postings -- the plot seemed
   under-developed, and why was everyone in such an all-fire hurry to get the
   old Skinner back when the new one, if a bit of a party pooper, didn't seem
   all that bad? The ending was a riot -- only in Springfield would they tie
   Skinner to a chair and ship him out of town. (B)

Joe Klemm: A plot that doesn't seem interesting at first comes back with a lot
   of clever jokes and scenes. Very funny and a silly approach to a plot line
   that could be dull without jokes. Examples of funny moments include Homer
   eating dog food and how the town got rid of the real Skinner. (A-)

Michael S. Krechmer: The ending was something out of Lovecraft. Either the
   writers couldn't come up with a better ending or the whole point of the
   show was to make fun of other shows where there is no continuity. Still, I
   thought it flat and most of the people were out of character. Ralph was
   funny as always but the rest of the episode was silly. (D)

Haynes Lee: Not great but not a disaster like "Lisa The Iconoclast" which
   forever ruined the memory of Jebediah Springfield. (B)

Ondre Lombard: Someone needs to tie Ken Keeler to a chair and have him trained
   out of town.  This episode is extremely unnecessary, and to me, proves the
   writers are running fresh out of ideas.  I'm sick of these "revelations"
   with characters.  I mean, it was bad enough that we were expected to
   believe Ned is a walking emotional time bomb, and now this?!  What's cooked
   up for season 10? Bart was switched at birth with Rex (the actor in Lisa's
   class)?  Smithers is really a woman?  At any rate, about the episode.  In
   addition to its abrupt tampering with eight years of continuity, it was
   also meaningless, boring and totally without humor.  I don't think I found
   myself laughing at all.  There was a slight opportunity for good drama when
   Krabappel and Skinner said goodbye, but it was even more sudden than
   Krabappel's breakup with Bart's made up suitor.  With yet another patented
   cold-blooded ending (which fortunately didn't try to one-up Homer's Enemy),
   I'd say this is easily one of the least memorable episodes of the series,
   and considering its pointless nature, I'll pretend it didn't even exist.
   (F)

Michael K. Neylon: "The Principal and the Pauper" had a good potential plot
   and rather decent characterization for this season, but was made mediocre
   by poor plot and comedic timing.  While certainly some good jokes and
   scenes in this one, there was nothing truly memorable about it. (B-)

Werner Peeters: Hmmm.... Why is it that during the last four seasons the
   writers have to make a permanent change in the continuity? In season 6
   Bleeding Gums Murphy died, but he wasn't a major character anyway. In
   season 7 it was Lisa who became vegetarian, and well... it was along the
   lines of her character. In season 8 Milhouse's parents divorced, which is
   also not a dramatic change. But now Principal Skinner turns out to have
   been an imposter during the last eight seasons, which means that supposedly,
   he has made up all the Vietnam-stuff from previous episodes? That's radical,
   dude! Far too radical a change for the show; normally the general 
   situation at the end should be the same as the beginning, and the way they
   tried to "save" this goof by legally confirming Armin Whatsoever as being
   Skinner and putting the *real* Skinner tied-up on a train. The only superb
   joke was when Homer's brain instructs him to "move slowly towards the pie."
   (D)

Mark Aaron Richey: The writers return once again to their recent trend of
   revealing deep dark secrets of a supporting cast member.  This one is the
   most shocking revelation yet--Principal Skinner really isn't Principal
   Skinner--but has surprisingly little substance.  It's certainly not a bad 
   episode--there are plenty of good lines, including a motherload of Ralph 
   quoteables, but it really doesn't add up to much.  Martin Sheen, as the 
   real Seymour Skinner, is adequate, but given almost nothing to do.  A 
   little more meat, and I might have really liked it. (B-)

Benjamin Robinson: This episode would probably have made a good story; it's
   just that it isn't such a good idea for a "Simpsons" story.  It does raise
   some good dramatic themes, but the radical revision of Skinner's character
   proves to be too radical.  A backpedaling ending doesn't help, either. (C)

Donni Sapphire-Bernstein: Good episode. Not great, but pretty darn good. Lots
   of funny things happened, but I found it hard to believe- not that that's
   necessarily a bad thing, just that it took away from my total enjoyment of
   the episode. I was laughing for five minutes straight at "My theory is...
   Skinner likes dog food." Wiggums junior and senior both had hilarious lines
   throughout, though I think Ralph is being reduced almost to a state of
   mental retardation. It was a good storyline, there was a good sense of
   continuity to the episode, the idea of nasal Skinner as a 50s greaser was
   pretty funny. But what kind of repercussions will this have to the overall
   storyline? As we saw, Milhouse's mom is still going out with the American
   Gladiators guy, and Skinner & Krabappel are still a hot item. Are we going
   to be continually reminded that Skinner is not who he seems to be? I hope
   not. (B)

Kelly Stewart: The first half deserved about a D, but the second half was
   pretty inspired.  Especially Homer's solution (letting the real Skinner
   keep his dignity, ha ha!) and also the very ironic and self-referential
   command that everything be "exactly as it was before".  This was a
   hilarious goof on other shows which have wild plot contrivances one week
   which are completely forgotten the next week.  Anyway , not a great show,
   but better than the NYC ep by a long shot! (B-)

Jeffrey Stylos: The plot was far too predictable, and there didn't seem to all
   that many jokes.  My favorite part was the ending; there seemed to be a
   touch of meta-humor as it was clear that something needed to be done with
   the original Skinner and the 'fake' Skinner's name, before the show finished
   up. The flashback sequences were also fun.  Overall, not a memorable show,
   but still fairly enjoyable. (C)

Aaron Varhola: Disappointing; the story seemed to rush through major
   developments and underplay the emotions of the story, particularly Mrs.
   Skinner's.  In addition, the whole premise of the original Skinner's return
   seems like a version of the deus ex machina....I had previously been told
   that Lisa would have made the discovery that Skinner was an impostor; that
   would have made the story unfold more smoothly, like 3F13. (C-)

Yours truly: The idea of Skinner being a fake all these years -- they really
   know how to annoy a loyal fan, don't they? (D)

==============================================================================
> Comments and Other Observations
==============================================================================
>> Worst episode ever

For many people, this episode was, nay, still is, considered the worst episode
   ever.

>> The Return of Seymour Skinner

Boyota: The theme underlying this episode was, obscurely, the Medieval legend
   of the Return of Martin Guerre. Basically, a man goes away to war; someone
   comes back whom everyone takes as the man, including his wife, but
   eventually people notice a few things are not quite right.  But, the
   replacement man turns out to be better liked than the original, so people
   let it go. They made a movie a number of years back with the title, "The
   Return of Martin Guerre." An estimable American variation on the same theme
   was made in the movie "Sommersby" with Richard Gere and Jody Foster, taking
   place during the Civil War. The episode is a little bit funnier if you
   catch the whole Jungian archetype, variation on a theme thing.


>> Armin Tanzarian

Haynes Lee: Armin is a Hebrew name and Tanzarian is a Middle-Eastern name.


>> Just D'oh It!

Aaron Varhola: The original Sgt. Skinner's term in the slave labor factories
   is a reference to the recent controversy with Nike and various
   subcontractors they have in Vietnam, Indonesia, and China.  Some of these
   subcontractors were found to have paid under the minimum wage, used child
   labor, and physically abused workers.  Nike made a big show of severing
   contracts with a few of the worst offenders, but a recent report by a
   watchdog group found that these abuses are still going on.  Nike Chairman
   Phil Knight immediately labeled the group that conducted the recent
   inspections "Communists" because they oppose the U.S. embargo of Cuba.
   (I guess they'd be all right if there were shoe factories in Cuba).


>> Continuity

Mark Aaron Richey: It looks like Edna and "Seymour" have yet to break up. As
   one of the few who liked [4F09] "Grade School Confidential", I have to say
   ...Good. Meanwhile, it appears that Louann Van Houten is still dating Chase,
   aka "Pyro" from "American Gladiators".  As one of the few who liked [4F04]
   "A Milhouse Divided"...Good.


>> The American Flag

Andrew Gill: In 4F23, there are 9 stars on one side of the folded flag.  In
   a true army flag, there are to be 13 stars on the outside of the flag--6
   per side and one on the crease, I think.  Unless the flag was folded
   extremely improperly (when I was in the BSA, we'd always get at most 7 per
   side, and we sucked at folding), or there were 4 stars on the other side.
   BTW, This was verified by a kid I know.  When he asked *why* I needed
   to know this, I responded, "Sunday's Simpsons showed a folded flag with
   9 stars to a side."  His look was just beautiful.


>> An amazingly useless fact

Bob Stone: Principal Skinner's tuning fork rings in `D'.

Tony Hill: Tuning forks are pitched at A above middle C, which does seem a bit
   high for a school bell.


>> 4F23 Promotion

Benjamin Robinson: Just about any scene from this show would have given the
   secret away, so it isn't surprising that the Fox promotion department
   didn't use any in teasing this episode.  Instead, we see Bart's attempt to
   disguise himself as Nixon, lifted from "Marge Be Not Proud (3F07)."


>> Conspiracy Theory

yodatrojan@aol.com: Thinking back about the life of Principal Skinner/Armen
   Tanzarian, I have come to believe that Skinner is an agent of an unfriendly
   intelligence service.  
   One must ask oneself, who was it that got Homer interested in the Student
   Exchange Program.  Skinner stated that he knew that the student coming in
   would be from Albania. I believe he personally decided that Homer, working
   in the nuclear plant, would be ideal as a parent of the little communist.
   One must also consider that Skinner spent time in Vietnam, where I believe he
   spent time in a POW camp.  Re-education could have taken place there.  Or,
   it is entirely possible that Armen was a communist "sleeper" from the
   start, and the story he told of being a young ruffian was entirely
   fabrication. He actually spent his early life in a hostile nation being
   trained by an intelligence service to infiltrate the United States. It is a
   matter of debate whether he was trained by the KGB, Stazi, or Albanian
   security.  In addition, Seymour is very introverted.  He spends all of his
   time with "Mother." Draw your own conclusions.  Is he really with "Mother?"
   Is "Mother" also an agent? We know very little about her background.  While
   we are at it, a background investigation of Superintendent Chalmers may
   also be in order.  It is curious how the members of the B-Sharps also
   organized. The B-Sharps actually were a front for collaboration between Apu
   (an agent as well) and Skinner. Homer was included because of his because
   his lack of wit posed little threat of exposure of the group and his job as
   a nuclear technician offered chance for all of the agents to obtain secret
   information.  Wiggum was removed from the group when it was decided that he
   was a risk as a possible counterintelligence agent.  Barney seemed like an
   adequate replacement, as he also is an agent of the People's Republic of
   China, which explains where he gets money for beer. The woman seen with him
   was his handler.  If you think about other organizations in which the
   B-Sharps have taken part, you must recall the posse that Homer formed in
   response to the Springfield Cat Burglar.  This group terrorized Springfield
   for an extensive period of time, circumventing the authority of the police.
   It is my understanding that this group was a paramilitary unit bent on
   world domination (by Homer's own admission). Clearly, they intended to
   start with Springfield. With the support of at least three hostile
   intelligence services, this was entirely possible.  The group was never
   disbanded after the Cat Burglar crisis was resolved. Krusty is performing
   well as a Mossad agent. Israeli intelligence should be pleased with the way
   that Itchy and Scratchy have made to world more receptive to
   assassinations. Clearly, Itchy and Scratchy were based on the follies of
   Israeli intelligence.  Training films, perhaps.
   I hope this opens everyone's eyes.

G. Garth: And, of course, the splendid job he's done dumbing down the
   educational system, at least at Springfield Elementary. Thanks to him, most of
   the students there can't read or write, with thinking problematical. The
   only teacher there with a grain of intelligence has been co-opted by him
   and held hostage in a strange (assumed) sexless romance with vague
   promises of marriage to keep her hooked.

Mark Aaron Richey: Over the past couple of seasons, the writers have been
  basing episodes around previously unknown events from major and minor
  character's pasts. These episodes include [3F06] "Mother Simpson" (Homer's
  long lost mother appears); [3F13] "Lisa the Iconoclast" (Jebadiah
  Springfield was actually a pirate); [3F15] "A Fish Called Selma" (Troy
  McClure enjoys the company of fish a little too much); [3F16] "The Day the
  Violence Died" (Itchy & Scratchy were not created by Roger Myers, Sr.);
  [3F19] "Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in 'The Curse of the 
  Flying Hellfish'" (Burns and Grampa fight over stolen art from WWII); 
  [3F20] "Much Apu About Nothing" (Apu is an illegal immigrant); [4F05]
  "Burns, Baby Burns" (Mr. Burns's long-lost son appears); and [4F07]
  "Hurricane Neddy" (Ned has very repressed emotions).  For the most part, 
  these rewritten history episodes have been pretty unpopular, with the 
  possible exception of [3F06].

==============================================================================
% Act one.  At Springfield Elementary, Principal Skinner inspects his school.
% After touching the top of the locker in search of dust, he tests the 
% accuracy of the hall clock with his pocket watch (with Agnes' picture 
% inside), measures the distance from the wall to the garbage can with a
% ruler, and tests the bell with a tuning fork.  Meanwhile, Superintendant
% Chalmers sneaks by Skinner and goes into the Teachers' Lounge.

Good lord!  The rod up that man's butt must have a rod up it's butt.
-- Ouch, "The Principal and the Pauper"

    Edna: Oh, Superindendant Chalmers!  Can I offer you a cup of coffee-
          flavored beverine?
Chalmers: Yes, I take it grey, with creamium.  But first, before Skinner
          shows up, I have a secret announcement.  In honor of Seymour's
          twentieth year as principal, we've decided to hold a surprise
          tribute Friday night.
  Willie: It's my twentieth year, too!
Chalmers: The Teachers' Lounge is for teachers, Willie.
--  "The Principal and the Pauper"

% Willie spits on the ground as he walks out the door.  In Miss Hoover's
% class, she petitions her students for a volunteer to give an oral report
% on Principal Skinner's life at the tribute.

 Ralph: Miss Hoover, which one is oral?
Hoover: Out of your mouth, Ralph.  Volunteers?  Thank you, Lisa.
 Ralph: No, Miss Hoover, I'm Ralph!
Hoover: I only need one volunteer, Ralph.
 Ralph: Miss Hoover, which one is one?
  Lisa: Ralph and I could do the report together!
Hoover: Your funeral.
 Ralph: Miss Hoover?
-- Shaddup, Ralph, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% On the Simpsons' kitchen table, Bart hums a song as he sticks miniature
% American flags in little brown balls sitting on a baking sheet.

Marge: Bart?  Why are you doing that?
 Bart: Our class is making refreshments for Skinner's party.  These are in
       honor of his army days.
Marge: That explains the flags, but what about the dog food?
 Bart: My theory is: Skinner likes dog food!
Marge: Mmmm...Let's bake him a cake!
Homer: Ooh!  A fresh batch of America balls! [eats dog food balls]
-- Mmmmm... chunks of meat in a delicious jelly coating,  "The Principal and
the Pauper"

% Homer sits at a writing desk, projecting silhouettes of his head onto a
% sheet of paper on the wall.  His mother calls to him from upstairs.

  Agnes: Seymour!  Tell me what time it is!  Now!
Skinner: Seven o'clock Friday night, Mother!  Time for our weekly 
         silhouette!
  Agnes: No!  Cutting out your ugly nose gives me a hand cramp!
Skinner: Oh, but you love silhouette night!  And then we go through your
         bird book and make up silly captions... Mother, why are you all
         dressed up?
  Agnes: I'm sick of this house, and I'm sick of you!  Tonight we're going
         for a drive!
Skinner: What's so special about tonight?
  Agnes: Nothing!  Now put on your special suit and get in the car!
Skinner: Yes, Mother.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

% The two pull up to the elementary school.  A sign outside reads "Tonight,
% Surprise Tribute to Seymour Skinner".

Skinner: Why are we stopping at my school, Mother?  What does it say on 
         that sign?
  Agnes: [smacks him] I don't like your tone!
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

% Seymour and Agnes enter the school auditorium, where the crowd gathered 
% cheers "Surprise!".

  Agnes: Happy anniversary, son.
Skinner: Oh, Mother.  You are still the master of deception.
  Agnes: I surely am.
-- Like mother, like son, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% Lisa and Ralph give their presentation on Skinner's life on stage,
% underneath an immense picture of him, looking noble while an American flag
% flies in the background.

 Lisa: So, in 1966, a brave young man named Seymour Skinner enlisted and
       shipped out to Vietnam where he rose to become platoon sergeant.
       Ralph?
Ralph: Principal Skinner is an old man who lives at the school.  Lisa?
 Lisa: Sergeant Skinner was a hero.  He risked capture many times behind
       enemy lines.
Ralph: Teacher made me go to Principal Skinner's office when I was dirty.
 Lisa: And, he survived to make it back to Springfield, where he became the
       fine educator we salute tonight.
Ralph: When I grow up, I want to be a principal, or a caterpillar.  I love
       you, Principal Skinner!
-- A touching anniversary speech,  "The Principal and the Pauper"

% The crowd applauds the two.  A group of children sing a song about 
% Skinner, accompanied by piano music.

Kids: [singing] They call him Skinner, Skinner,
      Faster than lightning.
      No one you see,
      Is stricter than he...
-- Sounds familiar, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% Outside, a man rides in a taxi, and passes the school.  He reads the
% sign outside. "Tribute to Seymour Skinner...  Pull over, driver."
% Back inside, Chalmers stands on stage.

Chalmers: Now I know the school normally serves cake only on Thursdays.
          And I'm also well aware that today is Friday.  Nevertheless, 
          I have a surprise for you.
-- [mumbles debating on what this surprise is] "The Principal and the Pauper"

% Bart rolls out a cake onto stage, drawing applause.  Skinner walks up
% and shakes Bart's hand, receiving a small jolt.

 Skinner: Ooh, what the... an enjoyment buzzer! [laughs] Oh, thank you.  
          What a wonderful night to share with the people and the town 
          that I love.  I have never been happier, or prouder, to be 
          Seymour Skinner.
     Man: You're not Seymour Skinner!
 Skinner: Skinner!
Chalmers: Skinner?
     Man: I'm Skinner!
   Agnes: Seymour?  Ohhh!
 Skinner: Mother!
     Man: She's my mother!
Chalmers: Will someone remove that crazy man, please?
 Skinner: No, no, he's...he's not crazy.  It's true, I'm...[sighs] I'm...
          an impostor.  That man is the real Seymour Skinner!
-- The end of the Seymour Skinner we know and love, "The Principal and the
Pauper"

% The townspeople all stare, wide-eyed in shock.  Homer, meanwhile, has
% other matters on his mind.

Keep looking shocked, and move slowly towards the cake.
-- Homer's brain upon learning Skinner's true identity, "The Principal and
the Pauper"

% End of act one.

% Act two.  In Principal Skinner's office, Agnes has fainted and sits in a
% chair.

Chalmers: Now let's clear this up.  Who exactly are you?
     Man: [salutes] Sergeant Seymour Skinner, U.S. Army.
 Skinner: It's true.  I was in his platoon.  They said you were killed on
          that scouting mission.
 Skinner: No, just captured.  It's kind of a funny story, really.  After
          five years in a secret P.O.W. camp, I was sold to China for slave
          labor.  And since '77 I've been making sneakers at gunpoint in
          a sweatshop in Boo-Haun.
   Marge: That's not a funny story.
 Skinner: Well, I guess you had to be there.
-- I guess, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% "Anyhow, the U.N. shut the factory down last week, and the embassy shipped
% me home.  And here I am," concludes Skinner. 

Chalmers: So what's your story, Seymour?  If that is your real name.
  Armin: Well, obviously, it isn't.  My real name is Armin Tanzarian.
         [The townspeople in the room gasp.  Bart chuckles loudly.]
-- Not as bad as Joey Joe Joe Junior, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% "I'm an orphan from Capital City, and those who recall my fight to
% outlaw teenage rudeness may be shocked to learn that I myself was 
% once a street punk."  In the past, Armin Tanzarian drives his motorcycle
% through Capital City, snatching a purse from an old woman and driving away.

Oh, yeah, the way I was headed it was just a matter of time before
I wound up in front of a judge. [Armin wipes out on a judge, who happens
to have been walking down the street]
-- Coincidence? "The Principal and the Pauper"

They gave me a choice.  Jail, the army, or apologizing to the judge and the
old lady.  Of course, if I had known there was a war going on, I probably
would've apologized.
-- Skinner, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% In the jungles of Vietnam, Armin's platoon fights out of a bunker.  Armin
% himself, however, is busy grooming his hair, until his comb is shot out of
% his hands.  He stands up while bullets whiz all around him. "OK, who wants
% a piece of me!" he says.
% However, his Sergeant, Seymour Skinner, tackles him to the ground again, 
% preventing him from taking a bullet.

Skinner: You trying to get yourself killed, Tanzarian?  You got your whole
         life ahead of you.  Don't you have any dreams?
 Armin: My dreams all involve combing my hair.
-- What passion-filled dreams they must be, "The Principal and the Pauper"

Skinner: Aw, gosh, son, everybody's got dreams.  I come from a town called
         Springfield.  And my dream is to go back and become principal of
         the elementary school.
  Armin: Some people might call that a pretty corny dream.. [beat] ..sergeant.
Skinner: Well, there's nothing corny about fresh-faced youngsters skipping
         to school, scraping knees and spelling bees and pies cooling 
         softly on the windowsill, heh.  Well sir, if that's corny, then
         corn me up.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

 Armin: [narrating] Sergeant Skinner took me under his wing, and showed 
        me that life is worth living.  I came to think of him as the big 
        brother I never had.  He made me believe I might have a future after 
        all.  And, when they told us he was missing, presumed dead, my 
        future died once again.  My life lost all meaning.
  Bart: Come on, get to the part where you steal his identity!
 Armin: I'm trying to explain how emotionally fragile I was.
  Bart: [loses enthusiasm] Oh, it's one of <those> stories.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

% "Sergeant Skinner meant the world to me, and I...I felt it was my 
% duty to deliver the grim news to his mother."
% Armin Tanzarian knocks on the front door of the home of Agnes Skinner.
% She answers.

 Armin: [clears throat] Hello, I'm, uh...[sighs] I'm...
 Agnes: Seymour?  Is that you?
 Armin: [narrating] I don't know why I did what I did.  I guess I couldn't
        bear to tell her about her son.  What I did was wrong, but... I'd 
        do it again.
 Armin: Yes, Mother, it's me!
 Agnes: You look different somehow...but you must be Seymour.  Yes.
        You are Seymour!
 Armin: [narrating] As strange as it sounds, deep down I think she knew I 
        wasn't her son, but a lie made us both happier than the truth ever 
        could have.
 Agnes: You can have some lima beans as soon as you've cleaned your room.  
        Go!  [whispering] Upstairs.  Third door on the left. [shouting]
        Don't walk on the rugs!
 Armin: Yes... Mother.
-- Inconspicuousness is a virtue, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% Back in the present, Armin finishes narrating his story.

   Armin: Don't judge her too harshly, Sergeant.  She was a lonely old 
          woman.  If you must blame someone, blame me.
 Skinner: That's pretty much what I was planning to do there, Armin.
-- ...Oh. "The Principal and the Pauper"

   Armin: Well, that's about it.  So for the past twenty-six years I've
          dedicated myself to living out your dream.
 Skinner: I didn't dream anything about an aqua suit or a lavender shirt,
          but you did take care of Mom.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

A dagger!  A dagger through my heart!
-- Agnes Skinner upon the shock of learning the truth about her son,
"The Principal and the Pauper"

   Armin: Oh, here, Mother, let me help you.
   Agnes: Get your hands off of me!
 Skinner: Please, Mom...
   Agnes: You too, stranger!
 Skinner: I'm your son!
   Agnes: [gravely ticked off] I have no son!
   Homer: Look, lady, obviously you have at least one son.
   Agnes: No!  I have one stranger and one fraud!
 Skinner: Take it easy, Mom!
   Agnes: I said back off!
   Armin: You'd better do as she says, she's quick with a hatpin.
-- Telling from experience, "The Principal and the Pauper"

   Armin: Uh, well, I suppose I'll have to find a hotel.
Chalmers: I won't hear of it.  Tonight, you can sleep on the floor of your
          office.
-- A true friend, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% The next day, Bart whistles as he opens the door to the principal's 
% office.  Armin climbs up off the floor and sits at his desk.

  Bart: Hey, Armin.  Mrs. Krabappel sent me.  I forged my Dad's signature 
        on my report card.
 Armin: Oh, now Bart, you know that's wrong.
  Bart: Well I don't see how me signing Homer's name is any different from 
        you using Sergeant Skinner's name.
 Armin: [sighs] I guess me punishing you seems somewhat hypocritical.  Why 
        don't you just write a thirty-word essay on what you've done.
  Bart: Hey, hey, hey!  Easy there, you big impostor.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

% At the Kwik-E-Mart, Armin writes Apu a check.  Marge Simpson stands
% nearby.

Armin: So, uh, um, should I sign my original name?
  Apu: Just put an "X", then call yourself whatever the hell you want.
-- Strong words, "The Principal and the Pauper"

 Armin: Well, now there's no need for profanity.  My name may have changed,
        but I'm still the same man I was last week.
 Marge: Not to us you're not.  I mean, how would you feel if you suddenly
        found out Ned Flanders was an impostor.
 Armin: Who's Ned Flanders?
 Marge: My next door neighbor, religious guy?
 Armin: Oh, you mean Reverend Lovejoy.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

% "No I don't!  What I mean is, to me, you're just a stranger, pretending
% to be something he's not.  Sorry, but that's just how I feel." Armin:
% "No, don't apologize.  It's time I stopped pretending."

% In front of a gathering of residents of the city of Springfield, Armin
% stands at a podium.  Superintendent Chalmers and Sergeant Skinner stand
% next to him.

I've called this assembly to announce my retirement effective as of the
end of this sentence... this sentence I'm speaking... right now... period!
[the crowd gasps]
-- Principal 'Armin Tanzarian' Skinner, "The Principal and the Pauper"

   Armin: I wrongfully usurped Sergeant Skinner's position, and I suggest
          you consider him to replace me.  Thank you.
Chalmers: Well, now, I don't know.  Skinner, do you know anything about
          being a principal?
 Skinner: Well, it's been my lifelong ambition.  And if a man pretending 
          to be me can do it, well, then, logically, the real me must be 
          far more qualified.
Chalmers: Good enough.  Armin Tanzarian's reign of terror is over.  Now
          let us welcome our new Principal Skinner...Principal Seymour
          Skinner!
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

% Everyone cheers, while backstage, Armin walks into the shadows.  Later,
% while standing at his mother's front door, he says good-bye his former 
% Sergeant, as well as his former life.

  Armin: Well, before I go, I've got some personal items for you.  You
         belong to the Radio Shack Battery Club.  Oh, oh, ten Canadian 
         dollars, that's a souvenir from your trip to upstate New York.
Skinner: You've led quite a life, Tanzarian.
  Armin: It's your life.  I've just kept it warm for you.  Oh, I nearly
         forgot.  Your pocket watch.  Mother's picture is still inside.
         Take good care of her.
Skinner: I'll wind her every day.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

% The two salute each other, when Agnes emerges from the front door.

I poached some fish for your trip, Mr. Tanzarian.  They're full of tiny bones,
so I want you to be careful.
-- Agnes Skinner, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% Armin hugs his mother and walks away, destination: Edna's apartment.  He
% knocks on the door.

Good evening, Edna.  I know we were planning to see a film tonight, but
instead I'm leaving town forever.
-- How about Thursday? "The Principal and the Pauper"

 Edna: No, please, I don't care what you've done.  You're still a decent,
       honorable man.
Armin: Mmm...that's the kind of talk that makes me want to marry you.
 Edna: [expecting him to pop the question] Oh!
Armin: But instead, I'm leaving town forever.  Goodbye.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

% He walks away from Edna's apartment and to the "Store-U-Stuff".  At 
% Garage 24, Armin pulls a leather jacket out of an old box, marked with his 
% name. "Well, it's time to pick up where I left off.  As a no good street 
% punk!" Armin tosses away the cover to his motorcycle and starts it; he
% drives past Bart, Milhouse, and Martin.

  Bart: Principal Skinner?
Armin: Up yours, children!
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

% End of act two.

% Act three.  Kent Brockman reports the evening news.

[laughs] Now to recap, our top story in its entirety.  The adaptable citizens
of Springfield.  Have opened their hearts to Principal Seymour Skinner, who...
[A picture of Armin Tanzarian goes up on the screen next to Kent.] Not that
one! [A picture of Sgt. Skinner appears on the screen, upside down.] Idiots!
-- Very unprofessional, Phil. Kent Brockman, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% On the TV, a crowd is shown, listening to Skinner speak.

Thank you, thank you.  I must say, in many ways, Springfield really beats the
old slave labor camp.
-- Sergeant Skinner's speech, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% They cheer.  At home, the Simpsons watch the report.

 Lisa: I admit Sergeant Skinner seems okay, but Mr. Tanzarian pulled 
       himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration.
 Bart: What about his name?
 Lisa: His name doesn't matter.  "A rose by any other name would smell as
       sweet."
 Bart: Not if you called them stench blossoms.
Homer: Or crapweeds.
Marge: I'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for Valentine's Day.  I'd
       rather have candy.
Homer: Not if they were called scumdrops!
-- Or asschews, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% In Mrs. Krabappel's class, Chalmers, Edna, and Skinner stand at the front.

Chalmers: Your new principal would like to say a few words.  Remember, you
          have to respect him.  He's a war hero.
  Nelson: Ha, ha!
 Skinner: Thank you, Chalmers.  You know, where I come from, there's no
          better way to get acquainted by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance
          together. [to Bart] Why don't you lead us, son?
    Bart: Hey, America, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind,
          America. [makes a farting noise, the kids laugh.]
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

Skinner: Well, that's very concise.  But it's an insult to everything I
         suffered for.  Now take a seat, junior, and listen to someone who
         gave their youth in service to their country.  Mrs. Krabappel,
         the pledge, please?
   Edna: You haven't dealt with women for a long time, have you, Sergeant?
Skinner: Are you asking me out?
-- A long time, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% In the streets of Capital City, Skinner walks among the dirty buildings
% and blaring police sirens. "Ah, 433rd street, my old neighborhood."
% Skinner pushes his bike in front of a building featuring "Topless Models".
% He sees a sign reading "Help Wanted", and gets a position advertising in 
% the street, wearing a sign reading "Nude! Nude! Nude!".  He reads his lines
% in typical (dull) Armin fashion.

Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Capital City's nakedest ladies.  They're not even wearing
a smile.  Nod suggestively.  Yes, six, count 'em, six gorgeous ladies just
dying...for your leers and cat calls.  Yowsa, yowsa.
-- Armin trying to promote 'Topless Nudes,' "The Principal and the Pauper"

% At the Skinner residence, Seymour comes in to find Agnes, angry and 
% waiting by the front door.

  Agnes: Oh, Seymour, it's 7:30.  Where were you?
Skinner: A bar, Mom.
  Agnes: I don't know what that is, but on Fridays, you come straight home
         after school!  Tonight is silhouette night.  Sit there!
Skinner: I really just came home to change into a turtleneck.
  Agnes: Seymour!  Sit!
Skinner: In the morning.  Oh, Mom?  I'm borrowing your car.
-- I have no son, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% Seymour takes the keys and leaves; Agnes gives a hideous glare.  Later,
% she stews in anger in the grocery store check-out lane.

Marge: Good morning, Agnes.  Mmm...how's your new son working out?
Agnes: That child is the most disobedient, smart-alecky middle-aged
       man in creation!
 Edna: Hello, ladies.  Is this the line for people who want to bad-mouth
       Sergeant Skinner?
Marge: And have ten items or less.
 Edna: [discarding items] Twelve, eleven, ten, the man's a weenie!
Marge: Now be fair, Edna.  I liked Armin Tanzarian too, but he was at least
       as big a weenie as Sergeant Skinner.
 Edna: But he was <our> weenie!
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

Now there was a weenie you could be proud to call your son.
-- Agnes Skinner talking about her son-imposter, Armin Tanzarian, "The
Principal and the Pauper"

% "Did you ever tell him that?" Marge asks Agnes.
% Agnes thinks for a moment, staring forlornly away.  Some time later, she, 
% Edna, and Homer ride in the front seat of his car.

Homer: Okay, once more.  Where are we going?
 Edna: To Capital City.
Homer: And why are you and the old lady in the car?
Agnes: We're gonna talk Armin Tanzarian into coming back.
Homer: And why is Marge here?
Marge: I came up with the idea.
Homer: And why am I here?
Marge: Because the streets of Capital City are no place for three unescorted
       ladies.
Homer: Why are the kids here?
Marge: Because we couldn't find Grandpa to sit for them.
Homer: Why is Grandpa here?
  Abe: Because Jasper didn't want to come by himself!
Homer: Huh, fair enough.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

  Abe: [to Agnes] Hello, beautiful.
Agnes: In your dreams!
  Abe: We'll see about that! [falls asleep, mumbling] Hello, beautiful...
-- [shudder] "The Principal and the Pauper"

% In Armin's apartment, the ex-principal lies on his bed while his 
% visitors stand around him.

 Armin: My mind is made up!  I'm not coming back!  And that's final.
  Edna: Oh, Seymour.
 Armin: And I'm not Seymour.  My name is Armin.  This is Armin's apartment,
        Armin's liquor, Armin's copy of "Swank", Armin's frozen peas.
 Homer: Can I see your copy of "Swank", Armin?
 Armin: Yes, you can.  This is Armin's life, and maybe it's not perfect, but
        at least I'm back where I belong.  I was born a no-goodnik, and I'll
        die a no-goodnik.
 Agnes: Seymour!  I didn't bring you up to use language like that!
 Armin: Well, you didn't bring me up at all!
 Agnes: To hell I didn't!  I've been taking care of you for twenty-six 
        years!  I'm the only mother you've ever known!
 Armin: But you have your real son!
 Agnes: You are my real son!  You've been my son longer than he has, and he
        doesn't need me, and I don't need him!  Now you march yourself
        downstairs and get in that car!
 Armin: Yes, Mother.
 Agnes: And the rest of you, too!
   All: Yes, Mrs. Skinner.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

% Arriving back in Springfield, Homer honks his horn, getting the town's
% attention, and lets everyone know the Skinner they know and love is back.
% The townspeople talk with each other, until Principal Skinner comes out
% of the elementary school to speak.

 Skinner: You all seem to be forgetting that I am Seymour Skinner!  This is
          where I belong!  You can't ask me to disappear just because you
          like some other guy better!  I gave half my life to you people!  
          Aren't I entitled to a little dignity?!
   Armin: You're, uh...you're right, Sergeant.
Chalmers: Well, I don't see any way out of this.
   Homer: Now if you'll allow me, I think I have a solution that'll satisfy
          the town, and let Sergeant Skinner keep his dignity.
          [Some time later, Sergeant Skinner sits in a chair, tied to a flat
          railcar. The train whistles and prepares to pull away.]
 Skinner: But I'm a hero!
   Homer: And we salute you for it.  Now don't come back!
-- No good at goodbyes! "The Principal and the Pauper"

I'm sorry, Seymour.  It's nice you're alive, but you're just not what I'm
looking for in a son.  I'm glad you understand.
-- Agnes Skinner, "The Principal and the Pauper"

% The crowd cheers as the train drives away, taking the real Seymour Skinner
% out of Springfield.

  Armin: Well, this is a lovely gesture, but we still have to face the fact
         that I'm not really Seymour Skinner.
  Homer: Oh, no we don't.  Judge Snyder?
  Judge: By authority of the City of Springfield, I hereby confer upon you 
         the name of Seymour Skinner, as well as his past, present, future,
         and Mother.
Skinner: Okay.
  Judge: And I further decree that everything will be just like it was 
         before all this happened!  And no one will ever mention it 
         again... under penalty of torture. [The townspeople cheer.]
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"

  Agnes: Here, son.  This is yours again.
Skinner: I've never been happier, or prouder to be Seymour Skinner, but,
         these last few days as that hot-headed rouge Armin Tanzarian has
         taught me a thing or two.  Now, maybe I've been a little too 
         uptight in the past.  Well, from now on, you're gonna see a new 
         Seymour Skinner!
  Agnes: Oh, no we won't!
Skinner: Yes, Mother.
-- "The Principal and the Pauper"
