   [If you use these summarise to determine if you have found the right
   capsule, here's a TV Guide-like synopsis: Following a violent sports event,
   Homer buys a gun to protect his family, driving Marge and the kids away
   from home.]

Couch:          Everybody has their rear ends on fire as they run to a
                water-filled couch. They hop on board as steam emerges from
                them.

       bikini?

   ... Mayor Quimby slept on the other side of the hotel from Marge?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... during the riots, two boys tip over a dog?

       on Homer's head?
   ... the kitschy clown and Elvis paintings in the hotel room?
   ... when Cletus asks if Homer is a moron, Homer answers, "Yeah, but..."?

   ... Homer seemed to say "Lousy Big Shit" when he stamped out of the store 
       without his gun? (listened to it three times and I swear that's what it 
       sounded like)

* The Simpsons eat breakfast at the kitchen table, and dinner in the dining
  room (usually), so actually they don't always eat at the same table. {bjr}

* Two foreign countries wouldn't have a soccer match in the U.S., and instead
  in either one of the two competing countries.  If the U.S. was competing,
  then they could have a soccer match in the U.S. {jg}

* Homer already has a shotgun.  [c.f. 8F11, 9F04, 1F08, 1F09] {jg}

* Marge shouldn't object to Homer's use of the gun, as she had one in 2F21.
  {jg}

* Homer should have known that Maggie shot Mr. Burns, as he was present
  when his shooter was announced in 2F20. {jg}

= The Crystal Clear Buzz Cola can had a non-clear beverage concealed inside.
  {jg}

= Lisa foolishly complained that Homer was making to much noise for 3:00 AM,
  although her bedside clock obviously reads the time 9:50 PM.

* Why would Krusty say what he did about the British monarch, as he was
  knighted by Elizabeth II in 8F24? {jg}

= Lisa didn't actually insert a coin into the bible. {jg}

* The NRA isn't an organization for protecting other people from danger, I
  believe.  It's just an organization for people with guns. {jg}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Once again, satire the Simpsons way: both sides of the
   debate get mocked. Overall, a very funny episode, although both the very
   ending and the first few minutes of the episode both could have been
   improved.  While Homer was fairly dumb, somehow it didn't bother me so much
   here. (A-)

Chris Courtois:  "The Cartridge Family" was yet another wildly uneven
   Swartzwelder outing. (Has the guy written any other kind of episode since
   Season 5?) One the plus side, we got some funny throwaway gags in the
   soccer riot and sleazy motel scenes. On the other hand, we had a topical
   story that kept lurching back and forth across the line between witty
   satire and heavy handed preachiness, and the umpteenth reiteration of
   "Homer-and- Marge-have-a-falling-out". The episode didn't really play
   fair, either, by putting the gun in the hands of Asshole Homer, rather
   than a real Simpsons character. (Many people had the same complaint about
   "Homer's Phobia". To those I disagreed with then, I guess what goes
   around, comes around :) ) Overall, this one gets a (B-)

Jordan Eisenberg:  Possibly my favorite of the season (a title I've been
   giving to a lot of episodes after I see them for the second time), this
   episode had all of the elements of a classic.  A smooth flowing plot, a
   strong beginning and end, a steady flow of Simpsonesque (read: funny) gags,
   a few good one-liners, sight gags, a hilarious Homer hallucination "What
   would life be like if I robbed the Kwik-E-Mart?" and, well, the first time
   in a while I lost track of what I was writing trying to think of all the
   funny parts! (A+)

Jeremy Gallen:  This was an excellent episode about Homer's experience with a
   firearm. What else can I say? (A+)

Andrew Gill:  This episode was one of the least funny GOOD episodes that I've
   seen in a while.  I'm always on the lookout for good quotes, but this one
   seemed to have very little in the humor department.  Of course, that's not
   the point of this episode.  For a preachy episode, this one ranks up there
   pretty high. (B)

Billy Goode:  Pretty darned good. Once again, however, there is no subplot to
   help offset some serious subject matter. Handgun ownership is an issue that
   causes passionate reactions on both sides and a nice subplot would have
   helped add some levity. Treatment of the gun issue was a bit wandering:
   Marge gives anti-gun statistic and Homer is a walking add to ban them;
   conversely, NRA members are portrayed somewhat favorably and Marg keeps the
   gun at the end. Some great lines and some solid laugh-out-loud moments. And
   remember- Vote Quimby! (B+)

Joe Klemm:  Talk about a funny episode. The episode was better than I thought.
   I found the soccer riot, the family scenes at the hotel, and Kearney at the
   NRA meeting ROTFL. Now if I can only see Bart with the girls at the sleazy
   hotel. (A-)

Werner Peeters:  When watching this episode, my wife said: "Hey! Didn't she
   wear a gun in the episode where she became a cop?" And this is also my
   critic about this episode: on numerous previous occasions, the Simpsons
   have wielded weapons of all kinds, so it's a little bit strange that Marge
   is making such a fuss about it altogether. But generally the jokes were
   quite okay, I especially enjoyed the various forms of misuse of a gun
   Homer is demonstrating, and the hilarious NRA meetings ("So this is how,
   with a few minor adjustments, you turn a regular gun into five guns").
   Vote Quimby!! (B)

Benjamin Robinson:  This on-target episode is well balanced, well plotted and
   best of all, funny.  Only Homer can think of so many hilariously
   inappropriate uses for a gun in the house!  I also liked how "The Cartridge
   Family" made its point against guns in the house without vilifying all gun
   owners. The ninth season's first "hit." (A)

Donni Saphire-Bernstein:  It wasn't as patently pro-gun control as some of the
   gun nuts here had feared it would be, but it still had that irritating
   taste of a "Very Special Episode." That being said, I thought it had quite
   a lot going for it. The soccer riots were great, the tv repairman at the
   Bouvier's was perfect, and I've always thought Homer and gun owners were on
   about the same mental wavelength :). Marge came across reasonable as
   opposed to narrowminded, a refreshing change from how she's been lately
   concerning serious issues. And though the Very Special Episode thing was
   unavoidable, Marge walking away with the gun avoid a predictable ending and
   kept up with standard Simpsons unpredictability. (B+)

Doc Quack:  I find that this episode was confusing, trying to preach a lesson
   that it couldn't sustain.   Lisa's statement that the Bill of Rights was
   out of date, picking out one section, while ignoring that her statements
   could apply to freedom of speech and religion, seemed far too radical for
   her.  On the bright side, all of us that find Marge to be a sexy woman, got
   two treats in this show.  One,  Homer's mental view of her in a very sexy
   and revealing outfit,  plus Marge's strut when she pockets the pistol for
   herself.  I don't think this one is destined to be a classic by anyone's
   reasoning, but like any of the Simpson shows, it does have a bright spot or
   two. (C)

Yours truly:  A cool episode. (B+)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> The making of "The Cartridge Family"

Benjamin Robinson: This behind-the-scenes information appears on www.snpp.com,
   but I wanted to include it here for the record:

"CNardozza@aol.com mentions [...] There was a great gag at the end of this
   episode which will without a doubt not appear in the show: When Marge get
   the bill from the hotel clerk (the guy with one arm) she looks at it
   puzzled and says 'I didn't order a blowjob!'. I swear it's true!!!"

   Ha ha!  Great gag!  (Well, if this story is really true, and would it be
   on SNPP if it wasn't?)  The censors probably made the right call; it's not
   really appropriate for something that airs 8:00pm on a Sunday.

   "The closing credits should have 'Happiness is a Warm Gun', but they're
   still waiting for Michael Jackson's OK."

   Well, hopefully they didn't try too hard to get permission, because theme
   music under credits appears to be a thing of the past, at least for now.


>> That Richard Gere story, again

Benjamin Robinson: According to a recurring urban legend, actor Richard Gere
   was injured while pursuing a deviant sexual practice that required shaving
   the fur of off gerbils and stuffing the live rodents up his bum.  I'm
   inclined to disbelieve this tale, if only because I've heard the same
   thing repeated about other celebrities, both national and regional.
   (Usually, if you hear the same sensational story about two or more
   different people, that's a sign the story is bogus.)

   This is not the first time the show has referenced this legend.  Observe
   Smithers in Dr. Nick's waiting room in, "My Sister, My Sitter (4F13)."


>> Yiddish, Springfield style

Benjamin Robinson: At the soccer game, Krusty calls the players a bunch of,
   "schnorrers."  According to
   http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Yiddish/English/comwor.html
   this is the Yiddish word for beggar.  Later, Krusty calls Homer a "yutz,"
   which is one of the million or so words for a stupid jerk.


>> Are you ready for some football?  Well?  Are you?

Benjamin Robinson: In the rest of the civilized world, it's called,
   "football," and fans follow it as avidly as "Simpsons" fans follow DYNs.
   Here in America, it's called, "soccer," and we pay about as much 
   attention to it as we do to UPN.  The episode hinted at what I suspect may
   be the reason for soccer's slow acceptance stateside: while there may be a
   ton of action in a game, much of it revolves around finessing the ball into
   position, rather than scoring.  The two sportscasters' reactions are
   typical.  Kent Brockman, the Yank, is bored to death by the proceedings;
   his European counterpart is on the edge of his seat with excitement.

   The term "soccer riot" is most closely associated with Great Britain, which
   has had its share of fighting (and fatalities, unfortunately).  However,
   passionate feelings about soccer aren't just limited to their corner of the
   globe.  In Central America, actual wars (!) have started over disputed
   soccer outcomes.  More recently, angry gangsters killed a player who
   screwed up at the World Cup when he returned home.  And the Indianapolis
   Colts thought they had it rough...


>> Five Days

Joe Klemm:  The five day waiting period law is the Brady Bill. The bill,
   which was signed in 1993, was created by a former Secret Service member who
   was shot in 1981 when he tried to save Regan from being killed by the Jodie
   Foster fanatic.

Doc Quack:  It has also been appealed by law enforcement officers since it
   makes them de facto slaves of the federal government, doing paperwork
   without pay, which is a federal offense.

   Another misconception is that it is in effect in the entire US.  It's only
   in effect in those states without an existing waiting period.  It does not
   apply to the state of Florida, for example.


>> Who shot Mr. Burns?

Joe Klemm:  Homer's comment of Smithers shotting Burns refers to the
   alternative ending to Who Shot Mr. Burns. The ending, along with five fake
   endings, were made in order to keep the real ending a secret from everyone.
   While the five fake ones were made to make people who knew the animators
   get a false idea of how it ends, the alternative ending was used to make the
   producers not tell the real ending.


>> The King of England?  Not likely.

Andrew Gill:  A typical argument used by gun-toting lowlifes (and me) is that
   the first step that an oppressive government will take is to get rid of
   their weapons, so that there can be no insurrection.  This is the first time
   that I've heard that in conjunction with the King of England, though.


>> Damn soccer, Why can't we have more football?

Andrew Gill:  For those outside the US, soccer is considered one of those
   "sissy sports" by many Americans (read--it's not basketball, baseball, or
   football), In recent years, this has changed drastically.  Soccer has taken
   off, and it may soon be as popular as it is elsewhere.
   [It already is. In the UK it's like a mainstream religion. --hmw]


>> The Sky's the limit...

Lets hope the people at Sky TV in the UK aren't supersticious. 5F01 was going
   to be broadcast as usual back in 1997, but shortly before it premiered, a
   mass-shooting occured in the States (can't remember whereabouts). In
   respect for the victims (and for their own good name), Sky didn't show "The
   Cartridge Family," and instead, released it around 1.5/2 years later on
   the "Too Hot For TV" video tape.  The episode was going to be broadcast
   sometime after January 1st 2000 when the incident wasn't recent anymore,
   but then sometime close to the release of the video tape version, the
   Colorado tragedy happened, shoving it back once again. Who knows if it will
   ever be seen on UK television.

Ross Tregaskis:  Strangely, they allowed "Homer the Vigilante" (1F10) through
   uncut (which has a similar plotline and gun references).

Salesman: Intruders could come in down the chimney, through the mail slot,

-- Gasp! "The Cartridge Family"

% Marge eyes a sack of groceries in the kitchen suspiciously.

Salesman: Did you change the locks when you moved in?  Eh, I thought not.
          All the previous owners of this house could still be in here

   Marge: What do you recommend?
Salesman: Well, a lot of companies would put in a pretty system that looks
          good, but doesn't provide any real protection.
   Homer: Oh, let's get that!
Salesman: But if you really want to sleep easy at night I'd recommend
          sealing off every door and window with bullet-proof lucite.
   Marge: Wouldn't we all suffocate?
Salesman: [laughs] Well, I should hope not!
   Homer: Let's get that, the suffocation thing.
Salesman: And you can have it all for just five hundred dollars.
   Homer: Five hundred dollars?!  Aw, forget it.
-- "The Cartridge Family"

% Pushing the salesman out the front door, Homer hears his final case.

% The owner finally pulls the gun away from Homer.

% on a riding lawnmower pass by, each escaping without a shot fired in their
% direction.  Finally, the days pass, and he waits impatiently outside the
% Gun Shop as the owner unlocks the door.  Running inside, he runs into the
% men's room, flushes, and walks calmly to the front counter.

         Homer: Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me.
Gun Shop Owner: Well, let's see here.  According to your background check,

         Homer: Yeah.
Gun Shop Owner: ...frequent problems with alcohol...
         Homer: [laughs nervously] Yeah.

Homer: Okay...open your eyes.

%We see it from Marge's perspective: her eyelids open, revealing Homer

-- It's the best thing a wife could have wanted! "The Cartridge Family"

Marge: [hands in the air] Homer!  I don't want guns in my house!  Don't you

Homer: I thought Smithers did it.
 Lisa: That would've made a lot more sense...
-- Ah, memories, "The Cartridge Family"

 Bart: Hey Dad, can I borrow the gun tommorrow?  I want to scare that old
       security guard at the bank.
Homer: Only if you clean your room.
-- "The Cartridge Family"

Marge: Mmm!  No! [pulls gun from Homer] No one's using this gun!  The TV
       said you're fifty-eight percent more likely to shoot a family member
       than an intruder!
Homer: TV said that...?  But I have to have a gun!  It's in the Constitution!
 Lisa: Dad!  The Second Amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days.
       It has no meaning today!
Homer: You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa.  If I didn't have this gun, the 
       King of England could just walk in here any time he wants, and start
       shoving you around. [pushing Lisa] Do you want that? [pushing her
       harder] Huh?  Do you?
 Lisa: [quietly indignant] No...
Homer: All right, then.
Marge: I'm sorry, Homer.  No weapons.
-- "The Cartridge Family"

A gun is not a weapon, Marge.  It's a tool.  Like a butcher knife, or a
harpoon, or...uh, a...an alligator.  You just need more education on the
subject.  Tell you what.  You come with me to an N.R.A. meeting, and if you
still don't think guns are great...we can argue some more.
-- Homer laying down the sweet talk, "The Cartridge Family"

% Walking to a local N.R.A. meeting, Homer and Marge arrives at the entrance,

% Wolfcastle each pass through, setting off a red light on top.  When Kearney
% walks through without setting it off, Eddie sends him back through, where
% Lou hands him a pistol.  He carries it through, this time setting it off.

% Inside, Lenny, M-16 in hand, talks to the audience from a podium.

       and I'm hungry and lonesome and there's no one there to hear my
       various witty remarks!
Marge: What about the gun?
Homer: It's gone for good, Marge.  I finally realized, what's the point of
       having a gun for protection, if you've got no one to protect?
Marge: Oh, Homey... [they hug] Come on, kids, we're going home!
-- "The Cartridge Family"

% The kids roll by on the vibrating bed, cheering.  Down at the front
% desk, the Simpsons check out while Mayor Quimby gets a bucket of ice.
% Suddenly, Snake bursts into the room and holds a knife to the mayor's neck.

 Snake: Right, everybody, hands up.  You!  Give me the cash drawer.
Quimby: Do what he says, I'm too rich to die!
 Homer: [whipping out gun] Freeze, bad guy!
-- Oh Homer... "The Cartridge Family"

% Snake drops his knife and lets the mayor escape ("Vote Quimby!").  Homer
% holds him at gunpoint.

Snake: Okay, man.  Don't shoot, chill.
Marge: Homer!  You said you got rid of the gun!  You lied to me!  Again!
Homer: [facing Marge] I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was...
Snake: [grabbing the gun] Yoink!  Ho, ho!  Ha-ha, ha!
Homer: The joke's on you, buddy.  There's no bullets in that thing!
       [Homer laughs and jiggles a box of bullets.]
Snake: Yo!  Give me the bullets!
Homer: Okay!  Don't shoot!
-- "The Cartridge Family"

% As Snake begins to load the weapon, Moe, Agnes, Lenny, and Dr. Hibbert 
% appear in the doorway, pointing guns at Snake.  They yell, in unison, "Drop 
% it!".  Snake drops the gun and stares for a moment, takes the money from 
% the motel employee, yells "Bye!", and runs out the door.

Marge: How did you know we were being robbed?
Lenny: The clerk here pressed the silent alarm, and we picked it up on
       our scanners.
 Lisa: Did anyone stop that robber?
  Moe: No, I don't think so.
-- "The Cartridge Family"

% Homer picks his gun up off the floor and looks humble for Marge.

I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge.  But this gun had a hold on me.  I felt this
incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun.  So
please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!
-- Homer, "The Cartridge Family"

% Homer hands his wife the gun, picks Maggie up, and leads the kids outside.
% Marge, holding the gun by the barrel, steps on the lid pedal of a nearby 
% trash can, and is about to throw it in, when she sees her reflection in the 
% lid.  Posing briefly with the gun, she twirls it quickly on her finger and
% smiles, admiring her appearance.  Closing the lid, she drops the weapon into
% her purse and walks out of the motel, closing the door behind her.

% End of act three.
