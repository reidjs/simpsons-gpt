===============================================================================
Blackboard :- I will stop talking about the twelve inch pianist.
              I will stop talking about the twelve inch/ at cutoff.

Lisa's Solo:- None due to shortened intro.

Couch      :- Everyone sits down, but Homer notices a giant plug in the
              floor.  Curious, he lifts it up, and everything in the
              room gets sucked down the drain.

Don Del Grande:
    ... Santa's Little Helper is there before Christmas Eve, unlike in
        the Christmas Special?
    ... in the Christmas Special, they don't have presents and the tree
        isn't white, two things that are true now?

        closed by one person?
    ... both Homer and Marge have their heads out of the car windows
        when driving home because they have to change Maggie?
    ... the security guard says Bart violated the 11th Commandment
        (which, technically, is "Do unto others as you would have them
        do unto you") - "Thou shalt not steal" is the 8th Commandment
        (as stated by Lisa in 7F13)?
    ... the surveillance tape with Bart on it is dated December 21?
    ... Bart and Lisa brush side-by-side?
    ... Milhouse's bedroom has Radioactive Man, Sideshow Mel, and Krusty
        posters, a Krusty garbage can, a Krusty walkie-talkie, and a
        lava lamp?
    ... the receipt on Bart's picture says "PAID IN FULL"?
    ... Lisa calls it "the worst Christmas ever"?
    ... the "Putting Challenge" cartridge allows the player to hit with
        something other than a putter?

Tony Hill:
    ... the wholesale cost of "Bonestorm" is $59.99?

    ... Bart calls Marge "my man"?
    ... the red and green lampshades?
    ... OFF has windows above the garage in this ep?
    ... Milhouse has a double bed?

Benjamin Robinson:
    ... when "Santa" bazookas the new videogame into the game player, it
        splits the cartridge that's already in there in half?
    ... Bart swears as he tells Ms.  Van Houten he didn't swear?
    ... "capisce" means "understand?"
    ... the squishy noises the bathroom rug makes when Bart steps on it?
    ... Bart wears shorts in the dead of winter, even though the rest of
        the family is bundled up in warm clothes?
    ... Marge sheds a few tears when Bart presents her with the photo?

        commercials?

    ... the box has no IDSA rating?
    ... "THRILLHO" is eight characters long?

Ricardo Lafaurie:
    ... when Bart imagines the mascots ushering him to steal, he
        imagines _Luigi_ first?
    ... the fizzling flourescent light and the woman dressed in a bra
        and skirt in the "Employees Only" area?
    ... the answering machine doesn't seem to have any calling message
        on it?
    ... Maggie doesn't suck her pacifier in this episode?
    ... Lisa looks bored during taking of the family photo?
    ... the family now take their family portraits outside, whereas they

Jussi Pakkanen:
    ... the spikes on the reindeers' reins?

    ... Bart doesn't spend his Christmas in Juvenile Hall?
    ... the mouse hole in Juvenile Hall?
    ... how the lighting changes when Bart says "I'll show them what a
        black sheep can do"?
    ... Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge is a typical modern computer
        game: it has no playing content whatsoever?
    ... all video games have very grainy graphics?

Yuval Kfir:
    ... Bart actually says "I did it" (cf. "I didn't do it!")?
    ... Homer is sketching a BBQing-robot in bed (when Bart's punishment
        is considered) -- inventing something?
    ... the answering machine is of the older variety with the regular-
        sized casette?

Since when has Marge done that bedtime ritual?  {dh}

The comic book guy's desk is in a different place in 7F21 and 2F32.
{rl}

The stairs at the Van Houtens should be considerably steeper.  {dh}

Bart's coat magically appears on his body in between when he's in
Milhouse's room, and when he's being shooed down the stairs.  {jp}

Milhouse lives in a one-story house in this episode, but Mrs. Van Houten
keeps shooing him down the stairs anyway.  {th}

"Angus Podgorny's Caper Toss" should be _Caber_ Toss.  {ddg}

The security guard knows Bart's phone number without asking him.  {ddg}

The surveillance tape shows Bart taking the game over and over again,
rather than continuing to show what was taped after Bart took the game.
{ddg}

The copy of Bonestorm Bart takes in the surveillance video is a
different color than all the other games.  {dh}

The kettles aren't on the stove before Marge mentions them.  {dh}

Marge should know that Bart is capable of shoplifting from the Tracey
Ullman short "Shoplifting".  {rl}

The struts in the baby gate Homer slides across the doorway become much
thicker.  {dh}

At the end, in the exterior shot of the house, the car(s) in the
driveway are missing.  {dy}

When putting on the green, the flagstick must be lifted from the hole.

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Don Del Grande: B-Plus - It started out good, got boring in the middle,
    then became funny again near the end.  Hard to think of any
    improvements considering the plot line.

Erik Berliner: This was a good episode that could have been better.
    There was some good characterization of Bart, and some much needed
    insight into Marge, but this was as close as we've come to Stupid
    Homer in a long time, and that could have been avoided.  My Grade:
    B+.

Nelson Seggley: This episode was excellent.  To begin with, I think the
    premise of Bart as a shoplifter was long overdue.  Homer seems to be
    back to his humor-by-stupidity phase, which I applaud.  And
    everything with Milhouse got a thumbs up from me.  Overall rating:
    B+.

Adam Lipkin: Hmm.  Good premise, but I'm not sure if it was pulled off
    well.  It seemed much shorter than half an hour for some reason.
    Decidedly average, I think, overall.  The blackboard gag was
    excellent, though.  B-/C+.

Haynes Lee: Certainly not as memorable as the other Christmas episode.
    Unfortunately the show already had touched on the stealing-is-a-sin
    theme in "Homer the Heretic".  Just a basic retread of other child-
    rearing themes with very little Christmas theme.  Grade: C-.

Tony Hill: More holiday trouble for the Simpsons.  I usually don't find
    the ones with unfunny plots very memorable or deserving of high
    grades, but this one is good for a B-.  A funny subplot would have
    helped.  But the lampooning of the commercialization of Christmas
    was quite good.

Benjamin Robinson: A low key -- perhaps TOO low key -- episode; this one
    seemed almost downbeat, especially for most of the third act.
    Still, this was an interesting tale, if not all that funny.  I liked
    the way they conveyed Bart's emotional isolation from his parents.
    The closing credits were hilarious; don't miss them to get a snack.
    (B)

Matthew Kurth: No characterization, forced continuity, and worst of all
    - forced emotion.  In other words - one of the biggest pieces of
    tripe to come out of the Gracie Films offices since 2F17.

Scott Fujimoto: There were some funny scenes (the comic book shop, the
    Bonestorm commercial) but a lot of the jokes felt flat to me.  The
    highlight was the great interplay and characterizations between
    Marge and Bart -- not overplayed, but nuanced and believable.  I
    can't say the same for Milhouse.  Grade: C+/B-.

Dominik Halas: Although there were many hilarious moments, some of the
    humor seemed unnatural and forced, like in the bad old days of the
    sixth season.  The sentimental moments were, however, genuinely
    touching, making it a satisfactory Christmas episode.  Grade: B-.

Mark Richey: This episode was funny, but the plot reeked of "Very
    Special Episode".  Frankly, it wouldn't shock me to see this plot on
    an episode of, oh, I don't know, "Home Improvement".  I did like the
    emphasis on the relationship between Bart and Marge; however, OFF
    needs to get away from typical sit-com plots.  Grade: C+

Aaron Varhola: Awful.  Homer was at his doofus Fifth Season worst, Marge
    was overplayed as a doting mother, and Lisa was a non-entity; Lisa
    should have been a more active conscience.  One _big_ question: why
    would Bart follow Jimbo and Nelson?  Did Mike Scully even see "The
    Tell-Tale Head"?  Grade: F.

Nate Patrin: Well, a Simpsons episode without a completely convoluted
    and bizarre plotline may have seemed welcome, but it did seem like
    standard sitcom fare and not the usual Simpsons subversiveness we're
    used to...Coulda been funnier, coulda been worse. 6.5.

Frederic Briere: "Sentimental" episodes, like 3F01 and 3F06, didn't get
    to me recently.  I was wondering if I had become cold-hearted, but
    this one proved me wrong.  I guess I was touched by its simplicity:
    a dysfunctional Xmas in a dysfunctional family.  Of course, the
    videogame references made this even more enjoyable.  (B+)

Michael K. Neylon: This was an episode that probably hit close to home
    to most of us, with the charactization of Bart and Marge excellently
    portraying this awkward time of growth.  The only drawback was
    Lisa's characterization: slightly more immature that usual.  A
    memorable episode for the writing.  A+.

Yours truly: Ehh.  Some funny moments (Milhouse yelling to his mother,
    all the video game titles), but I wasn't particularly touched.  Once
    again, a fine casting choice: Lawrence Tierney was perfect as
    Brodka.  Grade: C.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> "Bloodstorm"

Nate Patrin says, "This is an actual game (!) which Gavin refers to at
    the Try-N-Save.  I saw it once; it's a bad Mortal Kombat ripoff in
    which you get to cut the arms, legs and heads off your opponents.
    Oddly enough, I read somewhere in a magazine that `Bloodstorm looks
    like a satirical game one would see on an episode of the Simpsons...
    ' Strange coincidence?  As far as I know (and hope), however, there
    isn't a `Bloodstorm 2'."

Ricardo Lafaurie adds, "Oh, yeah, _that_ game!  Many of you have
    probably _not_ seen BloodStorm, but its very similar predecessor,
    `Time Killers', which was in more arcades than BloodStorm.  They
    were both made by Strata, and feature lots of blood, gore, and guts
    but little in the side of gameplay.  Also, `Bloodstorm' has not been
    released on a home system due to its lack of success in the arcades.
    It just goes to show you that horrifying carnage does _not_ make a
    good game.  Horrifying carnage and 3-D graphics make a good game!"

>> The "Operation: Rescue" video game

I missed both jokes here the first time.  Ricardo Lafaurie correctly
    points out that it's a pun on the actual "Operation: Wolf" video
    game.  And better yet, Jean-Marc Vezien reminded me what "Operation:
    Rescue" actually is: it's a group of pro-lifers who hang out in
    front of abortion clinics and try to talk women out of getting
    abortions as they walk in.  Actually, I think they're actually quite
    a lot more invasive than that -- someone from talk.abortion can
    probably provide more details.

>> Cup and ball

Ricardo Lafaurie says, "This was a fad during the closing of the '80s,
    and they even developed worldwide competitions for this thing in
    Latin America!  I should know because I lived in El Salvador at the
    time."

>> Allan Sherman

Tony Hill notes, "Allan Sherman was a comic balladeer.  The album
    featuring `Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah' was called `My Son, the
    Nut.'"

>> Lawrence Tierney

Tierney does the voice for Don Brodka in this episode.  Steve Ferra
    provides some information on the actor: he's an actual ex-con "who
    might be best known for his role as Joe Cabot, the `mastermind' who
    put the group of crooks together in `Reservoir Dogs'."  Dave Kathman
    says his first big role was as John Dillinger in 1945.

Ricardo Lafaurie provides some more background, courtesy of Bill Takacs:
    "Legendary Hollywood `tough guy', on screen and off.  Remembered as
    the title character in `Dillinger' (1945) and as the consummately
    brutal lover of Claire Trevor in `Born to Kill' (1947).  Notorious
    also for his frequent, well-publicized past involvements in public
    altercations -- like barroom brawls -- and other real-life
    manifestations of rowdiness.  (In a 1973 incident, he managed to get
    himself stabbed.)  Though now a puffy-faced, totally bald old man,
    he continues as screen actor to project the hard-as-nails mien that
    has been ingrained since his younger days, as he evidences quite
    amply in Quentin Tarantino's `Reservoir Dogs' (1992)."  His first
    role was Louie in 1943's "The Ghost Ship", and at the time of this
    writing, his latest movie role was a mover in "Junior" (1994).  He
    also appeared on "Star Trek: The Next Generation"'s 1988 episode
    "The Big Goodbye", playing Cyrus Redblock.

>> Where is Springfield?

Tony Hill writes, "In Bart's fantasy, the `gifts' come from the Port
    Authority, which is a significant agency only in New York City-
    Northeastern New Jersey, in my experience; Mrs. Van Houten said
    Mechanicsburg without naming a state, suggesting that it's the same
    state that Springfield is in, probably Pennsylvania."

>> Video games in this episode

Frederic Briere opines, "The system shown on TV is too large to be
    anything other than a Sony PlayStation; it also has the same color
    and controller ports.  However, the top is rounded like the `older'
    Sega Genesis, and the controllers clearly have the same
    shape/color/configuration than those of the Sega Saturn.
    
    This system is cartridge-based, and has the graphic and sound
    capabilities of an old 8-bit system -- slightly better than "Video
    Boxing" in [7G06].  Moreover, numeric pads are from the Coleco era,
    with the exception of the Atari Jaguar.
    
    I wonder why Bart's drooling on such a game...Mortal Kombat on
    Genesis would even be better than _this_!"

 Bart: It's the coolest video game ever!
Marge: I'm sorry, honey, but those games cost up to and including $70.
       And they're violent, and they distract you from your schoolwork.
 Bart: Those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result
       in me getting the game.
Homer: I know how you feel, Bart.  When I was your age, I wanted an
       electric football game more than anything in the world.  And my
       parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life.
