    ... Homer was having trouble with the questions on `Grade School
        Challenge'?
    ... the name Dimoxinil bears a more-than-coincidental similarity to the
        real-world hair product Minoxidil?
    ... the sign that says `Honor system coffee refills 25c' over the
        coffee urn, and nobody paid?
    ... especially because they were talking about cheating the system?
    ... the <heart> on the "I <heart> Dimoxinil" T-shirt had hair
        growing on it? [Jym Dyer]
    ... the music the doctor used to drown out their conversation
        was the Mexican Hat Dance, the same music Marge and Homer
        used to drown out their conversation in `War of the Simpsons'?
    ... Barney was drinking at Moe's tavern early in the morning?
    ... Homer was reading `Playdude' in the barber shop?
    ... when Homer comes into work, he puts his hardhat over a meter
        that is in the red?  Even worse, the sign clearly stated,
        ``Hard Hats Required''!
    ... when Burns is viewing the security monitors, one screen has
        the picture of somebody smoking in front of a `No smoking' sign?
    ... the musicians in the executive washroom were playing Claude Debussy's
        String Quartet? [David Halm]
    ... Maggie didn't fall down?
    ... the security camera was made in the USA?
    ... the El Barto tag at Moe's?
    ... the boxes of file folders strewn around Homer's office?
    ... the ridiculous amount of tartar sauce Homer doles out?
[Chris Baird]
    ... The graffito of Burns on the workers' dunny?
        (Anyone able to make out what it says?)
    ... the IBM PC in the personnel office?
[Dave Hall (dave@sys6626.bison.mb.ca)]
    ... the sunglasses & pony-tail Homer is sporting when he asks Lisa what
        she wants? (cf. Don Johnson look from a few years back?)
    ... the books on Mr. Burns' desk are facing away from him?
        (He can't see the titles).

There's actually readable text in the article body:

        Declining issues outnumbered
   advancing ones by nearly two to
   one in nationwide trading of New
   York Stock Exchange-listed
   stocks, with 529 up, 969 down and
   498 unchanged.  Big Board volume
   came to 147.63 million shares, up
   [from] 119.39 million Monday.
        While the market treaded water
   [most] of the day, sell programs
   kicked in late in the session.  ``We
   suddenly got whipped with a real
   heady amount of program selling,        (sic.``heady'')
   and the market of course has been
   running quite thin.''
      The market has been losing
   ground since last Thursday, the
   day before the government report-
   ed employment figures for June
   that were not as weak as many
   analysts had expected.[]

>> The insurance form

Roger Allen {rla} reports:

1) His birthdate was 5/??/55.
2) He [was born] in either Nebraska or North Carolina, since the form was
   filled out as State: NE or NC.
3) His sex is Male (yes, really!), but the interesting part is--he checked
   Female first, then partially erased it.  What a Homer!

David Albert {da} reports:

Full Name:  Homer I. Simpson
Birthdate: May 10, 1955
SSN: 568-47-0000 (The 7th and 10th digits might be 8's).
   [Note: SSNs beginning "568" are all assigned in California, so we
        can presume that Homer was either born or at some point lived
        in California]

Home Phone: 555-6528
Work Phone: 555-7334 (I think; hard to tell on my TV).

Finally, notice that the form in his folder is clearly
marked "EMPLOYEE COPY" along the right-hand edge.  I guess
he filed the wrong copy of the form.
[Actually, it was marked `EMPLOYEE COMPLETE'. --rjc]

[Note that Homer's middle initial is given as `J' in many other episodes,
 so we can probably assume that the `I' is either sloppy handwriting or
 a mistake.]

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Inside jokes

When Burns emerges from the bathroom stall in the executive washroom, he says

    I was watching the DuMont last night, when I happened to catch a
    fascinating documentary on Rommel, the Desert Fox...

Bill Morris reminds us that DuMont was one of the first companies
to produce television sets.  But the pun is that back in the early
50's, DuMont had its own television network in competition with
the big three, much like what FOX is doing now.  (DuMont went under
because they didn't have the resources to expand.)  And to make sure
we get the joke, the documentary just happens to be about the Desert FOX.

>> Is Karl a Homersexual?

Harvey Fierstein is gay by his own admission.  Does this carry over to
his character?

Marc Conte points out that there were some references to the Gay movement.
Karl says that a new suit should say, ``Don't judge me, love me!'', which
is a slogan seen at Pride marches.  And Karl gets into high gear when he
gets Homer to go through an affirmation--Homer yells at the top of his
lungs that he is nature's greatest miracle, etc.

In `Do the Bartman', Jacques is dancing with a woman, who turns into Karl.

>> Gorilla man, for real!

Dr. David Gill gives us a brief history of minoxidil: Minoxidil is a drug
that originally was used for high blood pressure, but was found to have
excessive hair growth (all over) as a side effect. Someone thought to try
it topically to regrow hair and it was modestly effective, so is over
marketed as Rogaine.  It is still used as a last line agent for high blood
pressure.

Andrew Gill gives us a little more information:  in 1988, Upjohn marketed
minoxidil under the brand name Rogaine.  It's now owned by Pfizer.
Apparently, many of the writers were losing hair and had heard of the
product, thus spurring the plot.

>> So why're you kissing Homer, then?

When Karl kissed Homer, it appears that he may have rocked Homer's world a
little more than Homer may have realized.  It was the first time that a
man kissed another man romantically on network television.  There was a
kiss between two women on L.A. Law, and certainly Homer kissed Bart in
[7G02], but the next time that two men would kiss like that in prime time
would be in 1999, on Dharma and Greg.

The Simpsons producers used the ``Elmer Fudd loophole''--since Bugs Bunny
used to kiss Elmer Fudd, they claimed that it's the same dynamic with
Homer and Karl.

>> Baldness is hereditary

Robert Lippman points out that Bart doesn't react to the fact that he's
ruined his father and his family.  What scares him is that baldness is
hereditary.  Of course, what Homer doesn't say (perhaps because he
doesn't know) is that male pattern baldness is sex-linked.  You inherit
it from your mother, not your father.

Andrew Gill clarifies this: the gene for male pattern baldness is on the
non-homologous portion of the X chromosome, so there is no allele on the Y
chromosome that corresponds to this trait.  The only possible way to get
the trait from your father is if he gives you an X chromosome, in which
case you are either a woman or have Klinefelter's Syndrome.

>> Misc, &c.

>>> that union contract

So if Homer's going back to his old job, does that mean that Burns has
breached the union contract?  Who will be the junior executive?  The guy
smoking by the no smoking sign?

>>> jiko kanri

According to Jeffrey's J-E dictionary, jiko kanri means something along
the lines of self-supervision.  See the dictionary here:
<http://linear.mv.com/cgi-bin/j-e/dict>

>>> The painting in Homer's office

Does anyone recognise it?  I could swear I saw it in Janson's History of
Art, but I can't find it.  It looks a little like the work of Giorgio de
Chirico in terms of setting, composition and color, but it doesn't seem
like his style.

===============================================================================
>Animation, Continuity, and Other Goofs
===============================================================================
= The package of floss changes color
= When Dr. Boyle tells Homer that his insurance won't cover dimoxinil, the
  hair on the back of his head disappears.
= When Homer gets his job back, his chair disappears.
= The dimoxinil shouldn't have emptied below the neck of the bottle.
- During Patty's ``Look who's talking'', the animators mis-colored her
  and Selma's necklines.  For a brief while, their sundresses go up to
  the neck.
