> Didja notice...
===============================================================================
    ... the voice of Fat Tony was supplied by Joe Mantegna?
        (Doubly funny when you notice who plays Fat Tony in the TV movie.)
        And Neil Patrick Harris provided his own voice as well.
    ... Chief Wiggum not only drank on the job, but he didn't seem to
        take notice that a ten-year-old boy was working as a bartender?
    ... Bart's cell-mate is none other than Sideshow Bob?
    ... the D.A. is the same lawyer that defended Burns in Hutz' $1 million
        lawsuit?
    ... Fat Tony's prisoner number was 8F03, the production code for this
        episode? {dwt}
    ... right after Homer blames the sleazy Hollywood producers, the credits
        started rolling and who should be listed first but the producers! {jk}

Dave Hall {dh}:
    ... the grieving look on the teacher's face as the kids are loaded into
        the school buses?
    ... the satellite dash on top of the "Ah Fudge!" factory?
    ... fuzzy dice in the Pizza delivery truck?
    ... according to the clock in Bart's classroom, it's 8:35 when
        Ms. Krabappel made the announcement?
    ... the bars on the window of the "Lock Smith" shop?
    ... the hooded executioner beside the electric chair?
    ... According to the line marks, on the wall in Bart's jail cell,
        he (or the person in the cell before him) spent 18 days in jail?
    ... in Bart's nightmare, it appears Otto was the only one grieving?
    ... the cops were more interested with what's in Skinner's fridge than
        finding him?
    ... at 10:10 AM, Bart Simpson walked out of the courthouse a free boy?
    ... Maggie fell but once?

> Rave reviews
===============================================================================
stephen cr miller {scm}:  The episode had an eerie, dreamlike quality.
There were strange shadows throughout, and events so odd they could only
happen in dreams.  I kept expecting Bart to wake up and have the whole
thing be a dream - and then he did, except that it wasn't a dream after
all.  A nice touch.  All in all, an excellent episode.

Chuck Musciano {cm}:  This was a great episode!  The Simpsons are back!

Alan J Rosenthal {ajr}:  The way the clouds come out the first time was
the most amazing part.  Did you notice that Bart immediately gets splashed
by a passing car?

Ron Carter {rc}:  This is the Simpsons I know and love; Bart getting
trodden every moment, Homer dumb, Marge just plain exasperated, Lisa being
superior in attitude (but lacking in true compassion), and the whole clan
getting screwed in the end... Funny, 'cause it's true...

Yours Truly {rjc}:  My favorite part was the entire first act, where
absolutely <nothing> goes right for Bart.  A close second is Principal
Skinner's tale of his ordeal.

Dave Hall {dh} obseves that when Bart starts off for school, his green
note book is all nice and clean, but becomes water stained when he reaches
the school.

Bart was on the monkey bars.

Jeff De La Beaujardiere {jdlb}:

When Bart missed the bus, he walked to school.  But when he left school, he
had his skateboard with him.

[Well, maybe he keeps a spare skateboard in his locker? --rjc]

S. Mudgett {scm2}:

Not only that, he left home bareheaded.  He left school bareheaded.  Then he
came home wearing his lucky red hat.

Lawrence Alan Schwimmer {las} notes that Bart's drawing of Skinner has
mysteriously vanished when we switch back to Bart after Ms. Krabappel
announces that Skinner is missing.

David Gillett {dg2} writes:

Ha!  That cigarette truck was hijacked along Route 401 which, as we all
know, is the freeway that runs between Montreal (almost -- the number
changes at the Quebec border) and Detroit (almost -- Windsor, actually).
And runs practically through the tobacco-growing regions of Ontario.

===============================================================================
Chuck Musciano {cm}:

Bart was reading Radioactive Man while guarding the cigarettes.  In Three
Men and a Comic Book, we learn that the Radioactive Man serials were sponsored
by Laramie cigarettes.  And what kind of cigarettes were they?  That's right!

[This becomes less of an amazing revelation when you stop and realize that
 the only comic book we've ever seen is `Radioactive Man', and the only
 cigarette brand we've ever seen is Laramie's. --rjc]

===============================================================================
For those whose recollection of basic chemistry is rusty...  Principal Skinner
mixed baking soda (NaHCO3) and lemon juice (proton donor).  The resulting
acid-base reaction produced water and carbon dioxide

           -    +
        HCO  + H    ->  H O + CO
           3             2      2

The carbon dioxide was used as a propellant.

Of course, the reaction really isn't vigorous enough to do much.  (The
solution just bubbles, like soda pop.)  Even if it were, once he released
the cigar, its path would have been erratic, like a balloon when you let
it whiz away.  Let's not even think about how absurd the vacuum cleaner
stunt was...

But then again, that was the point.  His story was so utterly fantastic, it
was hilarious.

===============================================================================
From the musical front comes a note from Karen L. Klein {klk}:

Once Bart becomes a permanent fixture at the club, the music playing is
``One Fine Day'', including the lyrics, ``You're gonna want me for your
girl.''  What the hell?

% Bart wakes up bright and chipper (though he steps on a toy as he gets
% out of bed).  At breakfast...

Bart:  Looks like I've got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge!
       [hunts through the box of cereal]
       Hey, it's not in here.  You stole it!
Lisa:  No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart.
Homer: [coming in] Hey, look what I got!  A genuine official police badge!
       ``Calling all cars!  Come out with your hands up!'' Heh heh heh.
Bart:  Hey, that's my badge, Homer.
Homer: That's <Officer> Homer!  Hee hee hee hee.

% Bart returns to his room to find SLH chewing up his homework.  (9 x 9 = 100)

You ate my homework!?  I didn't know dogs <really> did that...
-- Bart to Santa's Little Helper, ``Bart the Murderer''

% He sees Lisa boarding the school bus out his room window and rushes out,
% only to have the bus doors close in his face.  Lisa waves good-bye from
% the bus window.  The second the bus pulls away, storm clouds roll in, and
% it starts pouring.  A car splashes him as he walks to school.  When he
% gets to the school building, the storm suddenly clears.  (D'oh!)

Ms.K: Bart Simpson, you're late.  Go fill out a tardy slip.
Bart: But I'm only five... [looks at the clock]  ten, twenty...
      Forty minutes!  That's pretty damn late!
-- ``Bart the Murderer''

% On the playground, Bart is on the monkey bars and says,
% ``Hey girls, look at me!''  But he rips his pants while trying to do a
% stunt.  ``You can stop looking at me now.''  A stray football hits him,
% and he falls to the ground.  It's nearly 1pm, and the class are excited
% about their field trip to the chocolate factory.  Everyone, that is,
% except Bart, who suddenly realizes that he left his permission slip at home.

Lisa:      I'm going to eat eight pieces of chocolate!
Wendell?:  I'm going to each chocolate 'til I barf!
-- Field trip to the chocolate factory, ``Bart the Murderer''

% Meanwhile...

Principal Skinner:  Here's a whole box of unsealed envelopes for the PTA!
Bart: You're making me lick envelopes?
P.S.: Oh, licking envelopes can be fun!  All you have to do is make a game
      of it.
Bart: What kind of game?
P.S.: Well, for example, you could see how many you could lick in an hour,
      then try to break that record.
Bart: Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me.
P.S.: Yes, well... Get started.
-- ``Bart the Murderer''

% The kids greet `Cocoa-Beanie' at the ``Ah Fudge!'' factory.

I think this is something Bart would really have enjoyed.
But it's the only way he'll learn...
-- Lisa, ``Bart the Murderer''

% The kids watch another of those educational films.

Welcome to the Chocolate Factory.  I'm Troy McClure!  You probably remember
me from such films as `The Revenge of Abe Lincoln', and `The Wackiest
Covered Wagon in the West'.
-- ``Bart the Murderer''

[haunting native American music plays, scene changes to an Aztec pyramid]
The history of chocolate begins with the ancient Aztecs.
[see a hand holding an `Ah Fudge' candy bar]
In those days, instead of being wrapped in a hygienic package,
chocolate was wrapped in a tobacco leaf.
[candy bar changes to a coiled tobacco leaf]
And instead of being pure chocolate, like we have today, it was
mixed with shredded tobacco.
[pull back to see a smiling Aztec fellow holding the cigar-shaped tobacco leaf]
And they didn't eat it, they smoked it!
[Aztec lights it, takes a puff, and smiles broadly]
-- Educational film at the chocolate factory, ``Bart the Murderer''

% Bart continues licking the envelopes, and watches the second-hand on the
% wall clock tick, ever so slowly.  (In fact, it even ticks backwards.)
% Meanwhile, the kids frolic absurdly in the factory.  It's nearly 3pm,
% and Bart's tongue is bone dry.  He asks, ``Cad I doe dow?''  Principal
% Skinner can't understand him, so he writes his request (left-handed).
% Principal Skinner lets Bart go a minute early.  Once Bart steps outside,
% it starts raining again.  He skateboards home, and the bus (returning
% from the field trip) splashes him.  Then the wheel falls off his skateboard
% and he tumbles down a stairwell.  ``What next?'' he sarcastically asks
% himself.  Bart finds himself on the wrong end of a dozen gun barrels.
% ``Uh oh.''

Bart: Eat my shorts!
Tony: Eat My Shorts?  Ah, okay... [consults the racing form]
      Let's see... Wait a minute, you little punk!  Eat My Shorts is
      in the fifth race!  I said the <third> race!
Bart: Don't have a cow!

      put a deuce on him.

Homer: Pfft!  I make more than that.

% Itchy and Scratchy.

It's funny because it's true.

% Chief Wiggum comes in...

Fat Tony:     Chief Wiggum!  You honor us with your presence.
Chief Wiggum: Baloney!  I'm not going to rest until one of us is behind bars.
              You!  You wouldn't happen to know anything about a cigarette
              truck that got hijacked on Route 401?
Fat Tony:     What's a truck?
Chief Wiggum: Don't play dumb with me!

% He adds that ``the boy here makes an excellent Manhattan.''  He offers one to
% Chief Wiggum, who drinks it and likes it.
%
% Homer sees Bart's room piled to the ceiling with cigarettes and concludes
% that Bart has started smoking.  Bart insists they're not his, but Homer
% doesn't believe him.  He threatens to make Bart smoke every single one

% At a press conference, Chief Wiggum explains that 12,000 cartons of

% At work, Fat Tony gives Bart a present, in gratitude for his help with
% the cigarettes.

Bart: Uh, say, are you guys crooks?
Tony: Bart, um, is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to feed your starving
      family?
Bart: No.
Tony: Well, suppose you got a large starving family.  Is it wrong to steal
      a truckload of bread to feed them?
Bart: Uh uh.
Tony: And, what if your family don't like bread?  They like... cigarettes?
Bart: I guess that's okay.
Tony: Now, what if instead of giving them away, you sold them at a price
      that was practically giving them away.  Would that be a crime, Bart?
Bart: Hell, no!
Tony: Enjoy your gift.

Marge: I'm not sure about the people Bart's working for.

Milhouse: Well, I heard Skinner's buried under his parking spot.
Student:  Well, I heard he was ground up into hamburger and served to us
          at lunch.
Nelson:   I heard Bart had Skinner killed by gangsters.
Bart:     That's not true!  It's just a rumor.  You're engaged in speculation.
          I know the law, you can't prove anything.
-- He was like that when I got there.  ``Bart the Murderer''

% Bart is tormented by a nightmare wherein Skinner's body keeps appearing
% and saying, ``You killed me, Bart!''  Bart is thrown into jail (the
% ``Death House'').

Bart: Reverend Lovejoy!  You've come to comfort me?
Rev.: Yes, Bart.  [pats Bart]  [emotionlessly]  There there.
      [pats some more]  There there.
-- An enormous help, ``Bart the Murderer''

% Outside the prison, a crowd (including Homer) demands Bart's death.
% Bart is placed in the electric chair, atop some telephone books, and
% the switch is pulled.  Bart wakes up in fright.
%
% Bart goes to the club early in the morning...

Bart: Did you kill my principal?
Tony: Uh, Chinese guy with a moustache?
-- ``Bart the Murderer''

% He says he didn't kill Skinner.  Chief Wiggum bursts in and arrests them
% all for the murder of Seymour Skinner.
%
% In jail (just like how Bart dreamed), Homer and Marge pay a visit...

Oh Bart, why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys?
-- Marge, when Bart is arrested for murder, ``Bart the Murderer''

Bart: What's that guy doing here?
Hutz: Lionel Hutz, court-appointed attorney.  I'll be defending you against
      charges of... [reads the deposition]  Murder One!  Wow!  Even if
      I <lose>, I'll be famous!
-- Inherit the Windbag, ``Bart the Murderer''

% Burns and Smithers read the newspaper...

Smithers: That Simpsons boy is looking at 180 years.
Burns:    Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a
          ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult.
-- ``Bart the Murderer''

% At the trial...

Tony: I didn't order this Skinner guy killed...
D.A.: But aren't you the head of this gang?
Tony: No.  I just stop by the club occasionally to read the complimentary
      newspaper.
D.A.: Then who is the kingpin, the [jargon I can't make out]
Tony: That's the guy!  [fingers Bart]
All:  [gasp]
Bart: Hey!
Tony: Forgive me, Don Bartholomew.
-- Is... ``Bart the Murderer''

% The other testimony is similar, all implicating Bart as the head of the
% operation.

Hutz:  Mr. Simpson, you've been the boy's father for ten years.
       Do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous
       criminal syndicate?
Homer: Well, not the leader, I mean...  [cries]  Oh, it's true, it's true!
       All the pieces fit! [bawls]
-- Is... ``Bart the Murderer''

Now, in light of the damning testimony from your fellow gangsters, your
father, your teachers, and the seemingly endless parade of emotionally
shattered babysitters...
-- The Judge's summing-up, ``Bart the Murderer''

% But before he passes sentence, Principal Skinner bursts in, disheveled.
% He tells his story:  Tony and his goons came to talk and he threw them
% out.  He went home and began bundling his old newspapers, but the stack
% fell on him.  (``Let this be a lesson to recycle regularly.'')  Trapped
% until the pile of papers, he survived the week by eating his mother's
% preserves and preserved his sanity by dribbling a basketball that was
% barely within reach of his one free hand.  (``I made a game of it.  Seeing
% how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that
% record.'')  When the police came to search the house...

Wiggum: Find anything this time, boys?
Cop:    Uh, no sign of him, Chief.
Wiggum: Princess Opal?
Opal:   I see nothing here, but I'm afraid it's splitsville for Delta
        Burke and Major Dad.
Wiggum: But they seem so happy!
-- ``Bart the Murderer''

% ... he called out, but they didn't hear him.  So he used a little
% fourth-grade chemistry to build a rocket, which he attached to a
% vacuum cleaner cord, and which wrapped the cord around a support beam.
% He then switched on the cord retraction on the vacuum cleaner, which
% pulled him to safety.  He concludes his story, and all cheer.
% The D.A. asks that Skinner's testimony be struck from the record,
% unsuccessfully.

Judge: Case dismissed!
Hutz:  Your honor... Do I still get paid?
-- Pro bono pocketo, ``Bart the Murderer''

% Outside...

Tony: Hey Bart, I hope there are no hard feelings.
Bart: Get bent.
Tony: I deserved that.
-- ``Bart the Murderer''

Tony: Me and the boys, we still think you got a big future in racketeering
      and extortion.
Bart: Sorry, Fat Tony.  I used to think your gang was cool.  But now
      I learned that crime doesn't pay.
Tony: Yeah, you're right.  [leaves in his expensive limo, complete with
      pretty woman]
-- Do as I say... ``Bart the Murderer''

% At home, the family watch TV.

Announcer:  Blood on the Blackboard!  The Bart Simpson story!
    Starring Richard Chamberlain as Principal Skinner, Joe Montegna
    as Fat Tony, Jane Seymour as the woman he loved, and TV's Doogie
    Howser, Neil Patrick Harris, as Bart Simpson!
`Tony':  Bart, I'm scared.  Let's get out of here.
`Bart':  Shut up!  Where do you want it, Skinner?
`Skinner':  [spits on him]
`Bart':  Not smart.  [pumps him full of lead]
Bart:  Cool!
Homer: Hey, when do we get the check for this?
Marge: Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to
       pay us.
Homer: Oh, you know who the <real> crooks are?  Those sleazy Hollywood
       producers!
