Profuse thanks to Ken Miller for locating an article from the newspaper
``Daily Press - Hampton Roads Newport News VA'' Nov. 16, 1990 written by
Terry Armour. I certainly hope Mr. Armour and his paper take no offense to me
passing along this newsworthy article.

    -------------------------------------------------
    Local baseball teams give inspiration to Simpsons
    -------------------------------------------------

    Fans of The Simpsons may have noticed an eerie local flavor in last
    Thursday's episode on the Fox Network.

    For those who didn't see the episode, Homer, the gruff but lovable
    patriarch of the Simpsons' household, was the mascot for the local minor
    league team.  His name was `Dancing Homer'.

    `Dancing Homer' was so good at the local minor-league stadium, he made the
    jump to the Major Leagues.  The major league team was owned by Dave
    Rosenfield, as in the Tidewater Tides general manager.  There were also
    references to Dave Glass, the Tides' former radio man, and there was a
    player on the minor-league team named Flash Bailey as in Lash Bailey,
    former Peninsula Pilot. [1]

    It turns out the episode was written by Ken Levine, who for two years has
    done some radio work for the Tidewater Tides.  Levine is a former writer
    for the Emmy-award winning Cheers. [2]

    According to Rosenfield, Levine hinted he would use Rosenfield's name in
    an upcoming episode. Later, Rosenfield was told to watch Thursday's
    episode.  His wife taped it for him.

    ``I had a bunch of calls on it,'' Rosenfield said. ``People saw it and
    thought it was interesting.  Funny thing about it is people always say,
    `Ordinarily I don't watch the Simpsons but I just happened to watch it
    Thursday.' ''

    Rosenfield was somewhat a bad guy in the episode.  He fired Homer Simpson.

    ``I haven't fired a mascot in my whole life, primarily because I haven't
    hired one,'' Rosenfield said with a grin. ``I only fire assistant general
    managers.''

    Rosenfield admitted he's not a big fan of The Simpsons, having now watched
    it just twice. Frankly, he doesn't find it funny. Rosenfield said he smiled
    once during the Thursday's episode. ``I know it's a very successful show
    and an awful lot of people like it,'' Rosenfield said. ``I'm just not one
    of them. I don't like The Simpsons.''
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mr Miller concludes, ``Mr Rosenfields' opinions about The Simpsons are fine
with me.  I don't like the Tidewater Tides.  So if you can believe what you
read in the newspaper, this is the story behind the baseball episode of The
Simpsons.''

[1] Actually, the character's name was Flash Baylor.

[2] Ken Levine and David Isaacs always work together as a team.
    They wrote 28 `Cheers' episodes together, and earned two Emmy
    nominations for their work.  (They didn't win, though.)

[3] Oh, and by the way, the Tidewater Tides are the farm team for
    the New York Mets, if you cared.

===============================================================================
As they set out on their journey, they pass a sign that says, ``Capital City,
220 miles.''

>> Things in Capital City

  * The Cross-Town Bridge (a suspension bridge)
    [Cross-town?  What kind of city needs a cross-town bridge?]
  * The Penny Loafer (a restaurant shaped like a... well... a penny loafer)
  * Street crime.
  * A bum who washes your car windshield.
  * Tony Bennett singing the song, `Capital City'.
  * The `Original' Frenchie's.
  * Fourth Street and `D'.
  * ``To the brave men of the Army Reserve'' statue.  (A man holding a gun
    in one hand and a briefcase in the other.)
  * The Duff Brewery.  (``Can't get enough of that wonderful Duff.'')
  * A skimpily clad lady on the billboard shakes her leg; across the street,
    a man with a `shocked' look (on the Laramie's billboard) blows smoke
    rings (at her?). {dh}
  * `Health for less'
  * Neon sign for Bootleg T-Shirt Emporium.
  * Neon sign for St. Dominick's Cathedral.

>> The Capital City Song
            words by Jeff Martin
            performed by Tony Bennett
            interjections by the Simpson family

        [Homer: Well, kids, there it is!  Capital City!]
        [Marge: Look, the Cross-Town Bridge!]
    [begin vamp]
        [Bart: Wow!]
        [Homer: Wow.]

    There's a swingin' town I known called... Capital City.

        [Lisa: The Penny Loafer!]

    People stop and scream hello in... Capital City.

        [Homer: Kids, look!  Street crime!]

    It's the kind of place that makes a bum feel like a king.

        [Homer: Wow, that's service!]

    And it makes a king feel some nutty, cuckoo, super-king.

        [Marge: Look, it's Tony Bennett!]
        [Tony: Hey, good to see you.]

    It's against the law to frown in... Capital City.

    You'll caper like a super-clown when you chance to see...

        [Marge: Fourth Street and `D'!]

    ... Fourth Street and `D'!  Yeah!

    Once you get a whiff of it, you'll never want to roam.

        [Homer: The Duff brewery!]

    Capital City, my home sweet, yeah!
    Capital City, that happy-go city,
    It's Capital City, my home sweet swingin' home!

        [All: Capital City!  Yeah!]

The song was also performed during the closing credits, but our local
affiliate decided that hyping `Beverly Hills 90210' was more important
than hearing Tony Bennett.  Anyone care to check if there were any
new verses?

>> Where is Capital City?

Theron Stanford {tws} notes...

Capital City seems to be a synthesis of a number of large American
metropolitan areas.  The "crosstown bridge" is a parody of SF/East Bay,
as well as perhaps NY.  Also, Capital City has two restaurants named
"The Penny Loafer" and "The `Original' Frenchie's".  In Los Angeles,
there used to be a restaurant called "The Brown Derby" which indeed
was in the shape of a hat.  And there still is a hamburger stand on
Beverly and Rampart called "The Original Tommy's".  They have a number
of affiliated stands, as well as a few copycats such as "Tom's Number 5",
hence the epithet "original".

>> In the locker room {dh}

The `Playdude' pin-up in one of the lockers.  (cf. [7f02])

Pan show of locker room shows one of the players placing a cake on the seat
of another player (playing poker), who is about to sit down.  Another player
is placing a sharp object (tack?) under the seat of the player who's placing
the cake under the other player, while another player is testing the
flexibility of a towel behind that player.  Off camera, you hear the sound
of a crack and a yelp.

>> What happens on the field as Homer waits for his big break {jdc}

The right fielder catches a foul pop up and lands right next to Homer.
Everyone runs out on the field for a fight (one guy pops up in the air).
The Goof Ball rides by on a bicycle.

===============================================================================
> Other stuff
===============================================================================
>> Since this episode was a flashback, there is no inconsistency with
Mr. Burns having an outdated index card on the Simpsons, though it does
conflict with their banishment from all company outings in ``There's No
Disgrace Like Home''.  Apparently, Homer was forgiven after his mascot
escapades.

>> Homer and Burns drank three 72oz tubs, which comes out to 18 beers each,
3/4 of a case!  Burns must have set a world's record for blood alcohol
level since he only weighs about fifty pounds. {ptb}

>> Antoine Tex O'Hara

Eric Jablow {ej} points out:  For many years, New York's WABC-TV evening
news had a popular weatherman, Tex Antoine.  Tex had been around for 20
years or so, but he self-destructed in a gruesome way.  In the mid-70s,
his spot came up just after a report of a rape case.  Tex thereupon said
about the last story, ``Confucius says, `If rape be inevitable, just lie
back and enjoy it.' ''  This so-called joke got him first suspended, and
then fired.  [The incident was a major news story at the time.  Whether
this is an intentional reference or just a coincidence is still
unresolved. --rjc]
