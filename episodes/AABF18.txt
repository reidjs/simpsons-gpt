                NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR / FROM MY ARMP     at cutoff

Couch:          The living room floor is now a body of water, with the
                furniture floating on its surface.  The family runs in
                (shallow water, evidently) and jumps on the couch.
                Unfortunately for them, an iceberg floats by and sinks the
                couch.  The family goes down with it, but seconds later Maggie
                pops up on a cushion, and uses the remote to turn on the
                television.  [Recycled from AABF08]

==============================================================================
   ... Bart's costume for the contest is his "Bartman" mask, but without the
       cape?
   ... former Secretary of State Madeline Albright was one of the contest
       judges?
   ... fittingly, Smithers was the rear end of the horse in the Burns-Smithers
       horse costume?  [See "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]

Ben Collins:
   ... nobody in the Mensa group knows the Comic Book Guy's name?
   ... the Comic Book Guy looks fatter than usual in his Star Trek uniform?
       (I've seen people in Star Trek uniforms, and most of them don't have
       the type of figure designed for full-body spandex underwear.)

Don Del Grande:
   ... there were only eight voice actors (the regular six, Stephen Hawking,
       and Tress MacNeille)?
   ... Kirk's pacifier sounds like Maggie's?
   ... Lisa didn't put her name on her letter?
   ... the Comic Book Store Guy's shirt uses "forward" slashes, while DOS uses
       backslashes (because the forward slash is used for command line
       options)?  [See "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]
   ... the council didn't consider Chief Wiggum incompetent enough to fire
       him?
   ... technically, Quimby didn't abdicate, so the council didn't really have
       any powers?  (If the council could take over whenever Quimby left, when
       could he go on vacation, or on a business trip?)
   ... the bottom five cities are Flint, Michigan; Ebola, Rhode Island;
       Dawson's Creek, North Carolina; "Springfield, USA"; East St. Louis,
       Illinois?
   ... the "metric calendar" still has the month April, as opposed to, say,
       Quadember?
   ... Martin's IQ is 216, yet he's not on the council, nor is he in MENSA?
       For that matter, none of the other "Superfriends" are members?

Yuri Dieujuste:
   ... the speakers on Lisa's shelf?
   ... the order of the members of Mensa who finished reading the town charter
       goes counter-clockwise?

   ... the distasteful joke in "Grandma Plopwell's"?
   ... Homer has changed his views on stealing since [9F13]?

Darrel Jones:
   ... Homer defaces the  Van Gogh painting with a chocolate smear that looks
       like his own "beard"?
   ... despite the fracas caused by Bart drinking Duff in [4F15], someone
       throws a can of Duff Beer at him to swallow?
   ... nobody, not even fellow Springfieldians, likes the cast acting out of
       character?
   ... the pig Bart rides looks like the one in Homer's fantasy in [3F05]?
   ... Dr. Hibbert used to live in Alabama?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Dawson's Creek, NC is number 298 in the Top 300 Livable US Cities list?

Haynes Lee:
   ... Madeline Albright a judge [at the gross-out contest]?
   ... Mensa society on street no. 13?
   ... "Rise to vote sir" really is a palindrome?
   ... Comic Book Guys gets lucky less than once every seven years?

Andrew Levine:
   ... Madeline Albright's mug has the United States seal on it?
   ... Steven Hawking is the first guest voice who doesn't _have_ a voice?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... the dictionary isn't holding up the short end of the couch?
   ... one of the MENSA members looks like a blonde version of the network
       executive from 4F12 and 5F15?
   ... Homer is wearing briefs that don't have the usual design of briefs?
       (unlike earlier episodes)
   ... ritual circumcision included in the Springfield town charter?

       TV?
   ... the MENSA group finally gets Gazebo 7 when they hold the town meeting?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Snake dressed as a ballerina at the same event?
   ... although he's a Mensa member, Dr. Hibbert decides to go to the KBBL
       fool-off?
   ... Lisa isn't smart enough to jump out of the gazebo like the other Mensa
       members?
   ... this time, we got two riots in one episode?

Evan Ross:
   ... "KBBL" has replaced Marty?
   ... Mr. Burns' and Smithers' costume (i.e., Smithers' head is straight in
       Mr. Burns' rear)?  [See "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]

Gary Wilson:
   ... they apparently cancelled Ethnic Mismatch in the middle of an episode?
   ... it took Lisa the entire drive home to wipe her face off?
   ... Flanders implied that Jesus wasn't living?
   ... the Springfield branch of Mensa is located on Euclid St.?
   ... Homer never poses nude, despite what he's told?
   ... a spider is enough to keep Dr. Hibbert out of the gazebo?
   ... Frink was the last Mensa member to finish reading the charter?
   ... despite CBG's weight, he wants to outlaw obesity in women?
   ... the photo album is generically labeled 'for my Significant Other'?
   ... surprisingly, Homer is in favor of eliminating boxing?
   ... CBG changes [outfits] four different times in this ep?
   ... breeding once every seven years is an increase in amount for Skinner
       too?
   ... Skinner says he doesn't like Dr. Hawking's tone, when Hawking obviously
       doesn't have a tone at all?

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Rich Bunnell:  An amazing episode in a lax season.  Plenty of well-written
   jokes and Hawking's cameo was one of the most fitting and funny that
   they've had in a long time -- it didn't feel tacked-on at all.  Homer's
   subplot was sort of unnecessary but at least there was a subplot and this
   one was so absurd that it worked.  (A)

Ben Collins:  "They Saved Lisa's Brain" is a good, solid, well-crafted episode
   Season 10 needed more of.  It starts with an interesting, character-driven
   story and adds several ROFL gags (the jury duty notice, the CBG's T-shirt,
   Rev. Lovejoy's "book-burning mobile").  It's refreshing to see a rare
   non-Jerkass Homer and a Lisa the writers take seriously.  The only real low
   point for me is the riot scene at the beginning (have we seen this
   before?).  (B)

Lucas Cox:  There it is!  That was the episode I've been waiting all season.
   Both the main plot and the sub plot were very well thought out and the
   jokes were consistent.  I was never bored at any time during this episode
   which I don't think I can say for any episode this season.  Also, I was
   glad to see Frink get some good screen time for once.  Also, the guest
   appearance didn't seem as contrived as many others have been, and Hawking
   had some pretty good lines.  (Why did he actually have to guest star
   though?  They could have just gotten any voice synthesizer.)  If I had to
   pick the weakest part of the episode, it would be the first act, I saw the
   book burning gag coming from a mile away.  Overall though, this was the
   best one of the season.  (A)

Nathan DeHoff:  This episode really consisted of two different (but connected)
   plots: Lisa joining MENSA, and the academic elite trying to run
   Springfield.  These plots were tied together much more successfully than
   those in some other recent episodes, but the first plot lacked closure.
   Once MENSA took over the town, Lisa remained in the story, but she was no
   longer the focus.  Overall, I thought that this was a good episode.  I
   enjoyed the attempts by the "smart" people to improve the town
   (particularly those made by Frink and the Comic Book Guy) and Steven
   Hawking's appearance.  Did we really need two riots in one episode, though?
   The second one was useful to the plot, but the first one wasn't really
   necessary; Lisa could easily have objected to the contest even without the
   rioters becoming involved.  (B+)

Nicolas Di Candia:  Now that's a good episode!  "They Saved Lisa's Brain"
   shows that the much-criticized current writing staff is able to do
   classics.  I like the good use of Frink and the comic book guy.  The
   subplot wasn't needed, but added much fun to the episode.  This is by far
   the best episode of the last two seasons, I want more like it.  (A)

Yuri Dieujuste:  Personally this episode was a lot better than last week's
   episode.  Since it is a Lisa episode, I will give some extra credit.  The
   story was well executed and the plot was believable.  Some funny jokes
   added to the episode. Homer's subplot was not over-bearing and a nice
   surprise.  (B)

Jordan Eisenberg:  Were it not for the pathetic subplot, this would be the
   best of the season. But I liked the main plot so much that I'm willing to
   ignore the subplot entirely.  (Think of it as an "extra-credit" problem
   when you see the final grade.)  Last night's show was appropriately
   intelligent, and in my mind it came as close to an instant classic as any
   have for a long time.  The only problem was that shameless attempt at a
   subplot which I've now blocked out of my mind.  When The Simpsons is like
   this, I can only feel sorry for the show that comes after them.  Well, not
   really.  (A-)

Andrew Gill:  Not even the smartest man alive can make this show something
   that it is not.  What is it?  Pretty darn good.  I must admit that the
   timocracy wasn't exactly the most believable, but it does seem like the
   sort of thing that an old town charter would have.  The failure of the
   timocracy wasn't too believable, either, but OK.  The boudoir photo subplot
   ought to have been left out, IMNSHO.  Stephen Hawking was great, OTOH, and
   the plot was interesting.  Characterization was good, and I liked it,
   pretty much all-around.  (A)

Carl Johnson:  At last!  A moderately intelligent episode!  It still had the
   shakiness of Season Ten, but not as much as the other episodes.  There was
   a lot of moderately intelligent dialogue, a couple of funny jokes (loved
   the Larry Flynt line), and some of the potty humor, but not enough to ruin
   the episode, like in last Sunday's.  This episode didn't try to be funny,
   and that made it good.  It was a disciplined episode, even though at some
   points the gun misfired.  I thought the Quimby and the horse thing was
   dumb.  I thought Homer's Boudoir photography was dumb, except for the part
   with Milhouse and Bart on the window.  One loose end: What happened to
   Mayor Quimby?  That's another Recent Episode Conclusion That Ain't (RECTA).
   (B-)

Darrel Jones:  All the Season Ten nay-sayers need to watch this show.  My God,
   this is the best episode of the whole (nearly complete) season!  A surefire
   classic, with excellent gags, writing, and FFF jokes.  Not a single thing
   was wrong with it.  Stephen Hawking was excellent, and I loved the gadgets
   in his wheelchair.  10/10  (A+)

Joe Klemm:  While I don't care much about the story, I did find it enjoyable
   to see a whole bunch of cleverly written jokes in the episode.  The first
   act alone is enough to last a regular episode.  Let's hope the fun
   continues next week in the season finale.  (B+)

Haynes Lee:  Clearly the best this season.  An patently offensive beginning
   with a classy ending.  Stephen Hawking made one of the best guest
   appearances in a very long time.  (A+)

Jake Lennington:  IMO, one of the most boring episodes in a while.  The
   typical "Springfield goes riot happy" became old quite fast and the CBG
   seemed somewhat smarter than normal, which I thought was bit unusual.
   Another nit:  what is with these tasteless jokes?  This week had an old
   lady pushed out in front of a train!?  This is the third week in a row that
   TS has shown something rude and/or offensive.  (C-)

Andrew Levine:  This episode has far cleverer jokes than the previous three.
   Professor Hawking was probably the best guest voice of the season.  The
   ending was a bit predictable but the show on a whole was consistently funny
   throughout.  I'm a sucker for a good Lisa episode and this is one.  (A-)

Ondre Lombard:  There's too much one-dimensional characterization and too many
   liberties taken with realism here.  Intellect is given too much of a
   shallow treatment with this episode for its story to be likeable, and its
   efforts are undermined by mostly idiotic gags.  It's a bright milestone for
   Simpsons to celebrate to have someone as intellectually renowned as Stephen
   Hawkins on the show, but it still doesn't save the episode from having
   little impact for me.  (D+)

Patrick McGovern:  Pretty good.  Nothing special, but there were some good
   moments.  A strong 3rd act and a surprisingly good appearance from Stephen
   Hawking.  Great usage of secondary characters and (for possibly the first
   time this season) a well balanced amount of screentime for all of OFF.
   Homer's possibly icky subplot was very funny, though.  And, hey, there were
   3 classic lines-"Larry Flint's right!  You all stink!", "Are you sure
   you're a licensed pornographer!", and "Daddy says I'm this close from
   living in the yard!".  Gets a bit of a grade raises thanks to the
   "Ethnically Mismatched Sitcom."  (B+)

Tom Rinschler:  Although it wasn't a laugh-fest, "They Saved Lisa's Brain"
   makes up for it with a great plot and sub-plot.  It was interesting to see
   how Springfield's intellectual elite ran the city, and how their best-laid
   plans fell apart.  Moreover, Steven Hawking's appearance was actually
   useful for a guest star, and he had several scene-stealing lines and
   actions ("Your idea of a donut-shaped universe intrigues me Homer; I may
   have to steal it" had me ROFL).  (A)

Jason Rosenbaum:  Not as wonderful as I was expecting, but Hawking was one of
   best, if not THE best, guest stars of all time.  His appearance was
   relevant, funny and actually quite touching.  The MENSA plot could have
   gone on longer, and the Homer subplot was pretty stupid, but other than
   that, a nice episode in the sea of bad episodes (woah, bad analogy).  (B+)

Evan Ross:  All in all, a rather good episode.  Lisa's feelings that everyone
   else is stupid can be quite relatable, and gives her some acceptance
   finally.  No more episodes about how Lisa doesn't have any friends!  The
   ending was pretty true to life, because, generally, smart people don't work
   well together and all want to be in charge.  (I have a 155 IQ, so I can
   talk.)  A better episode than some more recent ones, and that gives "...
   Lisa's Brain" an  (A-)

Mike Smith:  Matt Selman really written up some great third acts, first, in
   "Natural Born Kissers" (Homer & Marge fleeing in the nude), then in
   "Simpsons Bible Stories" (Bart as David vs. Nelson as Goliath), and now
   this (Stephen Hawking).  (B)

Yours Truly:  A good premise -- Lisa joins forces with the local Mensa club
   and ends up running Springfield -- and good execution make this one of the
   better episodes this season.  Despite the lack of a really knockout scene,
   the show is amusing through its entirety.  Balance in the writing makes
   everyone silly enough to be entertaining, but not so stupid (or nerdish)
   that it takes the edge off the fun.  Even Homer's subplot works well.  (A-)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B+ (3.29)   Std Dev.: 0.7487   (31 reviews computed)

Tom Rinschler:  "Eine Kleine Nacht Musik" [is the] Mozart classic playing in
   the background at the MENSA house.


Joe Klemm:  "I'm Too Sexy" [by Right Said Fred] Music for Homer's photo shoot


>> "Shaddup You Face"

David Brunt:  This was ostensibly a comedy pop record.  It was composed and
   sung by the Italian-American Joe Dolce (billed as "The Joe Dolce Music
   Theatre" on the record).  It is sung under the guise of his cabaret alias
   "Giuseppi" -- an Italian musician.  Originally a big hit in 1980 in
   Australia -- where it was recorded -- it was a huge European hit in early
   1981.  It is, reportedly, one of the most covered songs in the world, with
   many European acts covering it at one time or another.


>> Those Endless Threads

 - Is Smithers gay?

Haynes Lee:  Smithers was the rear end while Burns was the front end of the
   horse.


Yuri Dieujuste disagrees:  Even though some see Smithers behind Burns in the
   horse, I see nothing that says that Smithers is gay.  I have seen that
   scene in other cartoons before.


Ondre Lombard:  Yes, but the fact that it's well established that Smithers
   *is* gay (and attracted to Mr. Burns) is what makes that ordinarily
   innocent costume routine have a double entendre.


 - Where is Springfield?

Haynes Lee, again:  Not Alabama or Connecticut and definitely not in the
   southern hemisphere.


Andrew Gill disputes this, however:  Not Connecticut?  How do you figure?
   They could still go to the insurance capitol of the world from inside the
   state.

   And how do you figure not the southern hemisphere?  Did Lisa ever say that
   they couldn't see Mensa?


Hardinger J. Flapdoodle:  No, but think of an American city below the equator
   ...


Andrew Gill:  Um, is American Samoa in the southern hemisphere?


Meanwhile, Don Del Grande notes:  The list includes states for the other
   cities but says "Springfield, USA"


>> All we need now is "Ye Olde Druggs & Rock-n-Rolle Emporium"

Rik Williams writes:  "Le Sex Shoppe" [is] a chain of adult stores in the Los
   Angeles area.  They're rather well-known for being more inconspicuous and
   classy than other shops of the same type (at least on the outside) even
   with locations in such otherwise family-friendly areas as historic Old
   Pasadena.


>> If you liked watching it the first time ...

Joe Klemm:  On September 6, 1997, Princess Diana's funeral took place.  Seen
   throughout the world, it was the most-watched program in the world.  Among
   the highlights included Elton John's only performance of the new version of
   Candle In the Wind, which with another song by John became the most bought
   single in the world.


>> C:\Nerds\Nitpick

Tyler McHenry notes:  Unfortunately, DOS uses a backslash as a path separator,
   thus, CBG's shirt should read

   C:\DOS
   C:\DOS\RUN
   RUN\DOS\RUN


Not so fast, says Rich Bunnell:  Actually the episode was right, simply
   because that's the mistake that the actual shirt makes.  It's wrong, of
   course, but the episode depicted the shirt correctly.


>> I've heard that voice before

And with good reason, says Nathan DeHoff:  The Generic Squeaky-Voiced Teen and
   Generic Sarcastic Middle-Aged Worker seem to have been joined by another
   generic character type, the Generic Female Business Executive.  So far,
   this type has appeared in "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show," "Girly
   Edition," "Make Room For Lisa," and "They Saved Lisa's Brain."  This type
   (presumably not always the same character) seems to have a fondness for
   modern business slang, of which "synergy" is a prime example.


>> Marilyn vos Savant

Andrew Gill:  Marilyn vos Savant is reported to have the world's highest IQ.
   Her column "Ask Marilyn" is a haven for self-congratulatory questions,
   which she typically answers correctly (but none less self-
   congratulatorily).  She is probably most famous for her erroneous solution
   to the Monty Hall problem.


Mark Finegold asks:  Was she actually "wrong"?  My memory has faded here, but
   I thought she and her readers had slightly different versions of this
   problem in mind.  I do not remember her being wrong any way you look at the
   problem.  On the other hand, I have a relatively low I.Q. and would never
   ever be offered a column in PARADE magazine, so ...


Andrew Gill answers:  It depends on the circumstances.  IIRC, the question
   goes something like

   You are a contestant on Let's Make a Deal.  There are three doors, one of
   which has a car.  You choose door #1.  Monty shows you door #3, which has a
   wadded-up newspaper.  Do you stay or switch?

   The problems come in with the semantics:

   1.) Are there two doors full of wadded newspaper, or, like on the show,
   does one door have cookware?
   2.) Does Monty want you to win or lose?
   3.) Does Monty even know where the car is?
      3a.) Could Monty inadvertently tip you off?
      3b.) Or is Monty told which door to open?
      3c.) Or does Monty occasionally open the door to the car?
   4.) Is Monty even obligated to open a door?

   On the real show, Monty would very rarely give contestants the opportunity
   to switch.

   In fact, Monty was eventually called in to host a demo.  During the study,
   he tried something tricky.  Every time a contestant would guess wrong, he'd
   immediately give them the newspaper, but he'd convince them to switch
   whenever they guessed right.  In this case, your odds of winning by
   switching are always zero.  If Monty wanted you to win, OTOH, he could just
   switch everything around and give you a 100% chance by switching.

   So MvS was wrong on the details.


>> MENSA

Andrew Gill:  I've been meaning to get my MENSA membership for a while, now.
   MENSA, a genius group, only accepts people with IQs that are
   (1/4)*ln(e)*(4096) ... (inspired by an actual ad in Discover Magazine). In
   layman's terms, that's uhh ... go see the [4F19] capsule.  It [MENSA, not
   the capsule -- Ed.] has a reputation for being pretty much what you saw --
   as bunch of losers who want to feel in control because they have high IQs.
   I'd fit right in. (except for that whole high-IQ thing.  Mine's only ~140.)


The aptly-named "Mr. Know-It-All" explains:  Numerical IQ scores are
   meaningless because IQ scales can vary quite a bit.  A 140 on one scale
   might only be a 120 on another.  You really need to know the percentile
   score for the test you took.  You qualify for MENSA if that score is in the
   top 2% (or, measuring from the other direction, the 98th percentile).  On
   most Stanford-Binet tests that's usually a score of 130 or 132.  On WAIS
   tests, it's about 148.

   The top 2 percent isn't really that distinctive.  It's sort of like being
   athletic enough to play high school varsity football (which doesn't mean
   you're good enough for NCAA ball, let alone NFL.) Theoretically, about 5
   million people in the US qualify for MENSA. That sort of intelligence is a
   far cry from being a "genius."

   People who achieve those test scores can be very different.  They could be
   jocks and cheerleaders, as well as nerds and geeks.  Admittedly, MENSA
   tends to attract the latter.  The smug humor displayed by Lisa's new
   friends seemed about right -- as did Hawking's comments on intelligent
   persons doing stupid things.  [See the MENSA newsgroups for examples.]


Benjamin Robinson:  Admission to Mensa is typically won by doing well on a
   supervised admission test.  However, prospective Mensans can also submit
   standardized testing scores to gain admissions.  (If you are under 14, as
   is the case with Lisa, you =have= to use standardized scores, because the
   Mensa tests aren't useable for people that young.)  The capsule for
   "Homer's Enemy (4F19)" (available at
   <http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F19.html>) lists the I.Q. requirements, so I
   won't bore you with those now.  Instead, I'll bore you with this list of
   IQs mentioned here and on other episodes, so you can see where Lisa fits:

   1) Stephen Hawking, 280 [*]
   2) Martin Prince, 216 {from "Bart the Genius (7G02)"
   3) Professor Frink, 197 (by episode's end)
   4) Comic Book Guy, 170
   5) Lisa Simpson, 156 (from "Homer's Enemy")
   6) Dr. Hibbert, 155

   Springfield's Mensa society seems really impressed by Lisa, but this chart
   shows that she's actually on the low end of the scale.  (Still, this is way
   above most of the world's population.)

   [*]  In reality, probably not quite *that* high, since that would beat the
   record by 70 points or so.


Benjamin goes on to say, "Standard disclaimers about the validity of I.Q.
   tests apply."  Mr. Know-it-all reinforces this point:  As I said before,
   you can only compare results with someone who has taken the same
   *supervised* test.  The numerical score is meaningless -- it's the
   percentile score that counts.  Otherwise, it's nearly as bad as comparing
   prices in Canadian dollars to those in US dollars without applying the
   exchange rate.


David Brunt adds:  MENSA does have small fan group sections within the overall
   'group' newsletter.  Most of those groups compile their own additional
   magazines/newsletters on specialized shows.  Aside from the inevitable Star
   Trek and Doctor Who ones, there is (or was) also a Simpsons magazine.

   Just thought I'd mention that ... Just *don't* ask ... !


On a personal note, Andrew Levine writes:  Mensa was started in the U.S. by my
   first cousin (twice removed), Margot Seidelman.  Just thought that was
   worth pointing out.


Oh, and Mike Lee notes:  FWIW, (1/4)*ln(e)*(4096) = 1024.  [A little higher
   than even MENSA demands ... -- Ed.]


>> Martin Prince:  Snubbed again

Ostap Bender wonders:  Martin Prince isn't even mentioned when it comes to
   high IQs and nerds?


"Scan" wonders:  Now the fact that Bart stole Martin's test score would
   explain why Martin is not in Mensa but it was never explained what happened
   to  Martin after his IQ test was sabotaged by Bart. Did they think he was
   being frivolous? Do they think he buckles under the pressure of an IQ test?


Vanessa Cox:  Maybe Bart came out with a pretty good IQ score through sheer
   luck (you know in the 150's), and they assumed that that was Martin's
   score.  The most likely explanation though is the negligent schooling
   system.  Isn't that what OFF often satirized in those early episodes?


Mr. Know-it-all, again:  That's not necessarily true.  Most people who qualify
   for MENSA don't bother to join.  Many of those who DID join allowed their
   memberships to expire after they got to know the other members.  I would be
   very disappointed if Lisa Simpson continues to attend her local MENSA
   meetings.


Nathan DeHoff:  I don't think that kids are usually accepted into MENSA, not
   matter how high their IQ's are.  Of course, Martin is older than Lisa, but
   Lisa's admittance was a special case.  Martin probably hadn't done as much
   to attract the attention of MENSA as Lisa had.


David Brunt:  If they pass the test with a high enough figure and pay the
   enrolment fee they're a member.  I have heard several instances of pre-
   teens joining over the years.  They're usually referred to as 'child
   genius' in the press ...


>> Oh, the places you'll go!

Benjamin Robinson explains some of the place names mentioned in this show:
   Alabama:  [mentioned for the benefit of our overseas viewers] One of the
   states in the U.S., which has a reputation for harboring the, shall we say,
   intellectually challenged.  It's not an entirely deserved reputation,
   though:  NASA has a research facility there, and Mercedes saw fit to make
   Alabama the site of their SUV factory.


Mel Levine counters:  It has a NASA facility probably because the chairman of
   the Senate Armed Services Committee for most of the '70's and '80's, John
   Stennis, was from there ... plus some jerk named Tom Bevill, who was a big
   honcho on the House Appropriations Committee.

   The Mercedes plant?  Lots of factories love to relocate to the South,
   because the white-trash workforces hate unions, for some incomprehensible
   reason; thus, most of the redneck states are "right to work" states,
   corporate havens for low wages, crummy benefits and the like.  Nice, docile
   workforce.


Darrel Jones:  Yes; Bevill represented part of Alabama in the House of
   Representatives for 30 years (1967-1997).  But Stennis (US Senator, 1947-
   1989) was from Mississippi.  I follow political history, so I know this.


Benjamin Robinson, again:  Flint, MI:  Factory town hit hard when the factory
   -- a General Motors automotive plant -- shut down.  Flint's plight was made
   famous by the Michael Moore film, "Roger and Me."

   East St. Louis, IL:  Home to one of the nation's highest rates of violent
   crime.  The police advise that if you're from out of town, and suffer a
   flat tire, that you keep driving until you're someplace safe, defined as
   being "anywhere but here."  Consider yourself warned.


>> Hey, that's not his real voice!

Andrew Gill writes:  Stephen Hawking is widely considered to be the smartest
   man alive. Until one year in college, he seemed to be a perfectly healthy
   man. Hawking has ALS, AKA Lou Gehrig's Disease, AKA Stephen Hawking's
   Disease.  ALS is a degenerative nerve disease that slowly renders a man
   immobile.  Hawking has been very lucky, since it has progressed very
   slowly.  He is now wheelchair bound, and only has any real ability in his
   one hand.  That is the hand in which he holds a one-button switch which
   connects to a speech synthesis machine.

   The speech synthesis program was originally the cause of much frustration
   for Hawking -- its voice is decidedly American, while he is an old Brit.
   When the ability to change it came along, he decided against it, since he
   (and others) had identified it with him so much.

   Hawking has also become an icon for PWDs (people with disabilities). He
   visited a program called DO-IT (<http://weber.u.washington.edu/~doit/>) a
   year or so before I became a member (Grr!), and has had a server named
   after him at the UW (home to DO-IT).

   Prof. Hawking must've been pleased with the way that he was drawn.  In real
   life, his skin isn't nearly as yellow (it's a pale grayish fleshtone), and
   his lips are beet red.  Brilliant man, but ALS has left his body a little
   unattractive.

   [Referring to the end of the show ...] Hey!  Hawking never actually drank
   the beer.  Well, he probably needs his attendant to lift it to his mouth.
   I suppose that he prefers that not to be animated ...


>> If he's so smart, what's he doing on "The Simpsons?"

Andrew Gill explains why:  The Simpsons is one of the few shows on TV that
   still has any substance. Watch Melrose Place or Suddenly Susan (my
   condolences if you actually watch them) if you don't believe me.

   Stephen Hawking apparently feels this way, too, judging from his comments:
   "I'm a great fan of The Simpsons.  I think it's one of the cleverest shows
   on television and it always has a moral.  So, I was delighted to be asked
   to appear."  Hawking joins another scientific great, Stephen Jay Gould (on
   "Lisa the Skeptic") who has lent his voice to the show.


A few people wondered if Hawking really *did* lend his voice to the show,
   inasmuch as his "voice" is computer-generated.  Sean Walsh answers:  I
   would think there would be some sort of legal issues if Hawking wasn't
   actually there and he was advertised as being on the show (it's happened
   before, where some event hypes someone who wasn't even booked to be there
   ... that kind of thing).


Alexei S. Esikoff:  for those of you who doubted it was really Hawking's
   "voice," Matt Selman confirms it in today's NY Times.  Plus, he references
   a.t.s. -- "Mr. Selman said that he had read an internet chat  among
   "Simpsons" fans suggesting the shows producers had faked it."


>> Donut-shaped universe?  Mmmm ... universe

Andrew Gill:  I must admit, a toral universe is intriguing.  It fits in quite
   nicely with Einstein's curvature of space, especially WRT singularities.
   If Homer alleges that the doughnut holes created by black hole
   singularities pop up in other singularities, it may be worth thinking
   about, and might be an answer to time's arrow.


Speaking of physics, Benjamin Robinson adds:  Hawking is known [...] for "A
   Brief History of Time," which makes astrophysics, if not simple, at least
   more comprehensible for people who don't like to curl up by the fire with a
   big book of equations.


>> Smart-Asses ...

... who haven't been discussed already, courtesy of Benjamin Robinson:
   Madeline Albright:  Secretary of State under the Clinton administration.

   Mel Lazarus:  Cartoonist who draws "Momma," a strip about a Momma, a
   slightly overbearing mother and her three adult children.  One son
   responsible but married to a woman of whom Momma disapproves, the other is
   a shiftless ne'er-do-well, and the daughter can't get her romantic life
   together.  It's the kind of strip that used to be popular twenty or thirty
   years ago, before "Calvin and Hobbes" and "The Far Side" shook things up.
   Lazarus also drew "Ms. Peach," but as I haven't seen that comic in a long
   time I'm going to declare it defunct.

   Larry Flynt:  Publisher of the notorious "Hustler" girlie magazine.  Like
   Hawking, he uses a wheelchair but, unlike him, he uses it because he was
   shot in the spine by a would-be assassin.


Ondre Lombard adds:  Now he's not always in the news, but he is a champion for
   free speech and constitutional freedom.


Todd P. Emerson adds:  Geena Davis:  Actress.  Geena Davis' first memorable
   performance (for me, at least) was in the movie "Tootsie," although she
   also appeared on a few episodes of "Family Ties," as well as starred in her
   own short-lived NBC sitcom, "Sara" (which also starred Bronson Pinchot, if
   memory serves correctly), before hitting it big in movies with such roles
   as in "The Fly."  I think she won an Oscar for some movie, but I forget
   which one.


>> Sex on the brain

Ondre Lombard observes:  Matt Selman's last episode "Natural Born Kissers"
   (5F18) revolved around sex. His next episode also includes sexual elements.
   And most interesting, both of them include Homer, or Homer and Marge doing
   embarrassingly secret sexual things.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Brainspotting


Jordan Eisenberg's Alterna-alterna-title:  "Pax Springfieldia"


Patrick McGovern's Unofficial Alterna-Title:  The Brain and the Boudoir


Jake Lennington suggests:  Fahrenheit 71: The Temperature at which Lisa
   Complains


Andrew Levine suggests:  I Am a Fugitive To a Brain Gang


Lucas Cox:  Jane Austen's books are actually among the few classics that are
   generally spared from most school and church "banned books" lists.


Don Del Grande:  Some states really don't use mechanical rabbits in dog races,
   because some people are afraid that the dogs are trained to chase the
   mechanical rabbit by chasing real ones.


Andrew Gill contributes the next two items:  Red and Yellow lights.  That's
   pretty much what I'd expect from someone who wants hamburger earmuffs ...

   Marge can feel the pound coming off by eating?  It must be the same gene
   that causes people to spend money to save money.


Daniel M. Gordon:  Lisa has a higher IQ than Dr. Hibbert.  (Lisa's IQ is 156,
   as revealed by Homer in 4F19, "Homer's Enemy", but Dr. Hibbert's is 155, as
   revealed by the Comic Book Guy in this episode.)

% Meanwhile, the audience boos Moe, who's wearing a kiddie sailor
% suit.

But it's me!  Moe -- wearing a sailor suit!  Moe, with a lolly!  I 
mean, it's so out of character.  Ain't that worth nothin'?
-- Moe, "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% It ain't, and Moe dismissively waves off the audience and walks
% offstage.

% That's all the contestants, so Bill asks the judges to decide who
% has won the trip to Hawaii (or at least Hartford).  Ranier
% Wolfcastle declares himself to be the winner, "for being seen with
% you freaks!"  His decision doesn't go over well with the crowd. 
% Lenny tosses a urinal cake at Krusty, who responds by hurling a
% trophy.  It misses its intended target, and instead knocks Kirk Van
% Houten flat on his back.  A riot ensues, with people throwing
% pudding samples.
%
% Lisa implores the people to stop fighting, but nobody pays attention
% to her.  An truck carrying a travelling Van Gogh exhibit makes a
% stop at the KBBL studios, and is immediately set upon by the
% rioters.  Homer smears some Grandma Plopwell's chocolate pudding on
% Van Gogh's famous self-portrait, making the artist look like he has
% Homer's five-o'clock shadow.  Lisa herself gets the pudding
% treatment -- twice.
%
% When she gets home, Lisa channels her anger into writing a manifesto
% for the town.

Lisa:	[speaking aloud as she types] An open letter to the people 
	of Springfield:  Today, our town lost what remains of its 
	fragile civility, drowned in a sea of low-fat pudding.
Homer:	[stepping into Lisa's room] Look!  I got runner-up prize!
Lisa:	You won second place?
Homer:	No, but I got it!  [leaves, then returns a second later] 
	Stealing is wrong.  [leaves again]
-- "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% The runner-up prize is a free boudoir photography session.  Homer is
% happy, especially after he looks up the meaning of "boudoir."  And
% "photography."  And "boudoir," again.
%
% Lisa resumes her letter.

Lisa:	We are a town of low-brows, no-brows, and ignorami.  We 
	have eight malls, but no symphony.  Thirty-two bars, but 
	no alternative theater.  Thirteen stores that begin with, 
	"Le Sex."  I write this letter not to nag or whine, but to 
	prod.  We *can* better ourselves!
	[Bart, butt nekkid, rides a pig through the hallway]
	[to herself] Well, most of us.
-- "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% Some time later, the newspaper publishes Lisa's letter.  That was
% step one.  Step two:  Getting someone to read it.  Lisa starts with
% her father.

Lisa:	Dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?
Homer:	Yes, there's a real think piece here about a bra sale.
Lisa:	Dad, stop kidding around.  Look, they printed my letter.
	[points to the article]
Homer:	Hey, that is wonderful, sweetie -- I'm going to read it.  
	Just as soon as I finish what I'm doing here.  [folds the 
	paper, takes off his reading glasses, puts the glasses in 
	his shirt pocket, and sits quietly]
	[Lisa waits a few seconds]
Lisa:	Well, I'm sure someone has the time to read it.
Homer:	I envy them.
-- Homer Simpson, master of time management, "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% Lisa approaches Ned Flanders.

Lisa:	Hi, Mr. Flanders.  I see you're reading the newspaper.
Ned:	[chuckles] Everything but the opinion page.  I don't need 
	to be told what to think -- by anyone living.
-- Semi-independent thinker, "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% Lisa runs across Chief Wiggum, who is carrying a whole stack of
% papers.

Lisa:	Chief Wiggum!  Boy, you sure have a lot of copies of the 
	paper.
Wiggum:	Yeah, I need to housebreak our new police dog.  Plus, it 
	couldn't hurt Ralphie to brush up on the fundamentals.
	[camera pans to the Wiggums' doorway, where Ralph is lying 
	on the floor next to a Doberman puppy]
Ralph:	Daddy says I'm this close to living in the yard!  [holds 
	his thumb and forefinger close together]
Lisa:	[sighs] Doesn't anybody in this town read?
-- What do you think?  "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% As if in response to her question, Reverend Lovejoy pulls up in his
% bookmobile.  He asks Lisa for book ideas, and she suggests anything
% by Jane Austen.  The Reverend thanks her and pulls away, revealing
% that he's really driving a book-*burning* mobile.
%
% Lisa goes home.  A paper airplane sails through her window.  Lisa
% catches and unfolds it, revealing a message.  Someone actually did
% read her letter, and wants to meet her at 13 Euclid Street.  "Tell
% no one," the anonymous writer instructs, "and bring a dessert."
%
% Lisa arrives at a modern and elegant home on Euclid.  As requested,
% she has brought a pie.  She rings the bell.

Hibbert:	[through an intercom] Lisa Simpson, are you ready to 
		go on a voyage of intellectual self-discovery?
Lisa:		I think so.
Hibbert:	Is that a pie, or a quiche?
Lisa:		A pie.
		[some murmuring over the intercom]
Hibbert:	You may enter.
-- Real intellectuals don't eat quiche, "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% Lisa opens the door.  Inside is a group of Springfield's finest
% eggheads, including Dr. Hibbert, Principal Skinner, Comic Book Guy,
% Prof. Frink, and Lindsay Neagle.

Hibbert:	Welcome to Mensa, Lisa!
Skinner:	It's the organization for people with high IQs.
Lisa:		I know that.  It's also a constellation visible only 
		from the Southern hemisphere.  [puts the pie on the 
		dessert table]
Frink:		She's good -- she's very good.  Mwa-ha-hi-vee, and 
		she bought a cream pie.
-- What more can you ask for?  "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  6:58]
%
% Lisa is flattered that the Mensans want her to join their ranks, but
% is a little confused.  After all, she didn't take any special IQ
% test to join.  Skinner assures her there's no problem, since he
% thoughtfully shared her confidential test scores with the rest of
% the group.
%
% Skinner explains that Lisa joins such Mensa luminaries as Marilyn
% Vos Savant, Geena Davis, and Mel Lazarus, each of whom stands at the
% top of their field.  (Well, except maybe Mel.)

Hibbert:	Lisa, I think you'll really enjoy it here.  Now, 
		let's get down to business.  Any new palindromes?
CBG:		[clears throat] Rise to vote, sir.
Hibbert:	Now, you know the agenda:  palindromes, anagrams, 
		eat Lisa's pie, then voting.
Lisa:		But, "Rise to vote, sir," is a palindrome.
		[the rest of the group murmurs favorably]
Hibbert:	Lisa, I think you're going to fit in just fine 
		around here.
Lisa:		Wow.  Me -- fit in!
-- "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% At home, Homer furtively pulls the shades and dials the phone.

Homer:		[disguising his voice, sort of] Hello, I have a 
		certificate for a free erotic photo session.
Photographer:	Oh, yes.  Your name?
Homer:		Eh, Geraldo ... Simpson.
Photographer:	All right, Mr. Simpson ...
Homer:		[normal voice] Aghh!  Who told you?!
Photographer:	Don't worry, these photos are perfectly legal.  Many 
		husbands use them as a romantic gift for their 
		wives.
Homer:		Uh, you're not going to ask me to pose nude, are 
		you?
Photographer:	Well, yes, unless you have some issues with 
		revealing your body.
Homer:		Well, I don't but the block association seems to.  
		They wanted a *traditional* Santa Claus.
-- Some people are so narrow-minded, "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% Meanwhile, the Mensa group talks about the declining standards at
% the Springfield Library.

Lisa:	My family never talks about library standards.  And every 
	time I try to steer the conversation that way, they make 
	me feel like a nerd.
CBG:	We are hardly nerds.  Would a nerd wear such an irreverent 
	sweatshirt?  [open his jacket to show off his shirt]
Lisa:	[reading the shirt] "C:/DOS  C:/DOS/RUN  RUN/DOS/RUN".  
	[laughs] Oh, only one person in a million would find that 
	funny.
Frink:	Yes, we call that the, "Dennis Miller Ratio."

% Lisa tries to tell Homer about her day, but the commercial he's
% watching finishes before Lisa does.
%
% The next day, Homer gets ready for his erotic photo shoot.  He's a
% little reluctant to pose in his underwear (and with good reason). 
% The photographer reassures Homer, and then "adjusts" her lens by
% slapping some Vaseline on it.  "Try not to speak," she advises,
% "it's making your body ripple."
%
% While Homer's posing, Bart knocks on the bedroom door. Homer jumps
% off the bed and bars the door with his body.  Bart gives up and goes
% away -- only to appear at the bedroom window, shocked at what he is
% seeing.  Homer quickly draws the shades.  When he opens them a few
% seconds later, Bart is there, and Milhouse has joined him.  Homer
% draws the shade again, and reschedules the session.
%
% The Mensans decide to hold a Renaissance-themed meeting in the park. 
% They are all dressed in elaborate Elizabethan costumes.

Lisa:		This is so cool!  I feel like I'm back in the 
		Renaissance.
Frink:		Please stay in character, gentle wench.
CBG:		Verily, I declare that the Earth revolves around the 
		Sun, and not t'other way 'round.
Lindsay:	Stop looking down my blouse, Copernicus.
CBG:		Forsooth, mine eyes doth rove of their own accord.
-- "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% When the group arrives at the gazebo they've reserved, they find
% that -- egad! -- some ruffians have already claimed it.  Skinner
% goes over to straighten things out.

Skinner:	Excuse me, gentlemen.  Might I take a peek at your 
		gazebo reservation form?
Lenny:		Beat it!
Skinner:	[chuckles] Yeah, well -- we each have a good case.
Carl:		What part of "beat it" didn't you understand?
Skinner:	Mmmm ... I guess that would be the "it."  I'm not 
		too sure to what that refers, as the -- [a beer can 
		bounces off his forehead] Ow!
-- That clears things up, "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% The Mensa group huddles and assesses their situation.

Hibbert:	Oh, it's hopeless.  There's some she-males in gazebo 
		three, a nasty-looking spider in gazebo six, and the 
		less said about gazebo eight, the better.
		[Chief Wiggum walks by]
Skinner:	Ah, Chief, thank God you're here.  We reserved 
		gazebo seven and look.  [points to the gazebo]
Wiggum:		Jeez, how many gazeboes do you she-males need?
		[walks into the gazebo]  Beer me, boys!  [Carl 
		tosses him a cold one]
Hibbert:	Why do we live in a town where the smartest have no 
		power and the stupidest run everything?  Maybe I 
		should just move back to Alabama.
-- "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% Instead of moving someplace else, Lisa pushes the others to fight
% and make Springfield better.  The others agree.
%
% Back in their street clothes, the gang marches into Mayor Quimby's
% office, announcing that the "jig is up" and that their report (on
% gazebo reservation reform) will change how things are done in the
% town.  This was perhaps not the best choice of wording.  Convinced
% that one of his scandalous deeds has caught up with him, Quimby
% calls for his goons, who shred all his incriminating documents. 
% Hizzoner himself flees on horseback to a waiting plane.
%
% Shortly thereafter, the police burst into the office.

Wiggum:		[cocking his pistol] What's going on?  Where's the
		mayor?
Skinner:	He skipped town.
Wiggum:		Really?  [lowers his weapon]  So, who's in charge?
Hibbert:	Well, that's a good question.  Let's, uh,  take a 
		quick look at the town charter.  [takes it down from 
		the wall, and lays it on the mayor's desk.  The 
		Mensans begin to read]
Lindsay:	Done!
CBG:		       Done!
Lisa:		              Done!
Hibbert:	                     Done!
Skinner:	                            Done!
Frink:		[sing-song] Fin-ished.
Skinner:	According to the charter, should the mayor abdicate, 
		a council of learned citizens may rule in his stead.
Lisa:		Well, there's no one more learned than us.
Hibbert:	So I guess [chuckles] we're in charge.
Wiggum:		Wha?  Lemme see that.  [takes the charter and starts 
		reading] See here ... We the people ... cruel and 
		unusual ... blah, blah, blah ... ritual circumcision 
		... yak, yak, yak, ah, geez, I'll take your word for 
		it.  [puts the charter back on the desk]  I guess 
		you are in charge!
		[Mensa group cheers]
-- "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% They waste no time in setting a new course for Springfield.

Lisa:		With our superior intellects, we could rebuild this 
		city on a foundation of reason and enlightenment.  
		We could turn Springfield into a utopia!
Skinner:	A new Athens!
Lindsay:	Or Walden II.
Wiggum:		Yeah, a real Candyland.  [the others stare at him] 
		Of the mind, the mind.  I'll just go now.  [he and 
		the other cops start to leave] Bunch of dorks.

% Three days pass, and Kent Brockman drops by city hall to interview
% the "Bright Pack."

Brockman:	So, Lisa, what do you and your fellow eggheads have 
		planned for the city?  Business as usual?
Lisa:		No, Kent, we're going to use the power of good ideas 
		to change things for the better.
Brockman:	[laughs] Well, excuse this jaded reporter if he says 
		he's heard that before.
Lisa:		Oh, well, we really mean it.
Brockman:	[shocked] Ahh!  You do?
Lindsay:	Yes.  For example, no one was showing up for jury 
		duty, so we made the experience more exciting by 
		synergizing it with his comic book collection.
		[cut to Moe's tavern.  Moe opens an envelope]
Moe:		[reading] You have been chosen to join the Justice 
		Squadron, 8 a.m. Monday at the Municipal Fortress of 
		Vengeance.  Oh, I am *so* there.
		[back to City Hall]
Frink:		We studied the traffic patterns and found that 
		drivers move the fastest through yellow lights.  So 
		now, we just have the red and yellow lights.  N'hey.
		[cut to Lenny, driving on the street.  The light 
		turns from red to yellow, and Lenny floors it]
Lenny:		C'mon, stay yellow, stay yellow!  Man, I'm making 
		record time!  [wistfully] If only I had some place 
		to be.
		[back to City Hall]
Skinner:	And we've really elevated the level of discourse at 
		the dog track.  [cut to the track, with Skinner's 
		explanation as a voice-over] We've replaced the 
		fanfare with classical music, and instead of chasing 
		a rabbit, the dogs chase a diploma.
		[back to City Hall]
CBG:		The world has already taken note of our 
		accomplishments.  [points to a computer listing of 
		cities]  Springfield has moved up to #299 on the 
		list of America's most livable 300 cities.  Take 
		that, East St. Louis!
-- Civic improvement, "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% Homer's rescheduled photo session takes place in the basement.  Not
% only is it safe from prying eyes, but it's also dark.  "Light is not

% in the background, Homer begins posing.

It's time to get Homer-erotic!
-- Homer Simpson, "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% The learned council conducts a weekly status meeting.  Skinner
% proudly reports that the trains are now running on time -- metric
% time.  Lisa asks for proposals to give at the State of the City
% address.  CBG has a plan for eliminating female obesity.  Lindsay
% brushes this off and suggests building a shadow-puppet theater (both
% Balinese or Thai).  CBG sarcastically dismisses the idea, which pegs
% Frink's sarcasm detector.

Ooh, a sarcasm detector.  Oh, that's a *real* useful invention.  [the 
detector beeps rapidly and explodes]
-- Comic Book Guy, "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% The council dissolves into bickering.
%
% Meanwhile, Homer surprises Marge with his collection of sexy photos. 
% There's one of him in an astronaut helmet and underwear.  And one of
% him in a revealing bear (not to be confused with bare) outfit.  He
% and Marge kiss.  Then, Marge turns to the shot of Homer posing in a
% fireman hat.

Marge:	Woo, woo, look at those silk pillows.  It's like the set 
	of some high-class porno film.
Homer:	Heh, heh.  No, no, it's our basement.
Marge:	Mm -- hold on!  That's our basement?
Homer:	Yeah, so?  Come on; more kissing.
Marge:	It looks so elegant.  And all it takes are some lace 
	curtains and a beaded lampshade.  [takes Homer by the hand 
	and leads him toward the basement] You've got to show me

Homer:	But I was going to score.

		nance!
Skinner:	[clears throat] We have some new rules and 
		regulations that you're just going to go ape-poopy 
		over.  Professor Frink?  [yields the mike to Frink]
Frink:		[clears throat] Well, first of all, we're going to 
		ban such barbaric sports as bullfighting and 
		cockfighting.
		[cheers from the crowd]
		Also boxing, both, uh, kick and the kinds with the 
		gloves, there.
		[less enthusiastic cheering]
		And hockey, football, push-ups, and anything in 
		general where you have to take off your shirt, which 
		is embarrassing.

Lisa:		[whispering to Lindsay] I don't remember discussing 
		that.
		[CBG takes the microphone]
CBG:		Inspired by the most logical race in the galaxy, the 
		Vulcans, breeding will be permitted once every seven

Willie:		You cannot do that sir!  You don't have the power!

% As the crowd grows more unsettled, the council begins to argue
% amongst themselves again.  The talk degenerates into an "I'm smarter

% wheelchair.

Council:	Stephen Hawking!
Skinner:	The world's smartest man!
Lisa:		What are you doing here?
Hawking:	I wanted to see your utopia, but now I see it is 
		more of a Fruitopia.
Skinner:	[chuckles] I'm sure what Dr. Hawking means is --
Hawking:	Silence.  I don't need anyone to talk for me, except 
		this voice box.  You have clearly been corrupted by 
		power.  For shame.
Homer:		Larry Flynt is right!  You guys stink!
		[the crowd cheers in agreement]
-- "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% Dr. Hawking tells Skinner he's not sure what's the bigger
% disappointment:  his own failure to formulate a unified field
% theory, or Springfield's egghead cabal.  Skinner objects, and
% Hawking punches him with a spring-loaded boxing glove he has mounted
% on his wheelchair.

% The fight incites the crowd to take action.

Homer:	Come on, you idiots!  We're taking back this town!
Carl:	Yeah!  Let's make litter out of these literati!
Lenny:	That's too clever -- you're one of them!  [punches Carl]
-- "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% Lisa meekly asks the crowd to stay calm, but a full-scale
% Springfieldian riot quickly develops.  Hawking figures it's time to
% make his escape and activates ... his automatic toothbrush.  Oops --
% wrong button.  His second try starts a set of helicopter blades and
% small thrusters, which enable Hawking to fly away from the gazebo. 
% As the roof is about to collapse upon her, Lisa yells for help. 
% Hawking uses his chair's telescoping grappling arm to grab Lisa, and
% rescue her in the nick of time.
%
% The two land safely some distance away from the fighting.

Marge:		Lisa, thank God you're okay!
Homer:		Did you have fun with your robot buddy?
Lisa:		[embarrassed] Da-aad!  [to Hawking] Oh, Dr. Hawking, 
		we had such a beautiful dream.  What went wrong?
Hawking:	Don't feel bad, Lisa.  Sometimes, the smartest of us 
		can be the most childish.
Lisa:		Even you?
Hawking:	No.  Not me.  Never.
-- "They Saved Lisa's Brain"

% Marge sums things up nicely, by saying that everyone has their own
% idea of what makes a perfect world.  Unfortunately, the sentiment
% isn't exactly hers -- she read it off Dr. Hawking's voice computer
% screen.  Trying to relieve the awkwardness of the moment, Marge
% suggests going out for some beers.  Hawking says, "That's the
% smartest thing I've heard all day."  So, the gang ends up at Moe's
% Tavern.

Hawking:	Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is 
		intriguing, Homer.  I may have to steal it.
Homer:		Wow, I can't believe someone I never heard of is 
		hanging out with a guy like me.
Moe:		All right, it's closing time.  Who's paying the tab?
Homer:		[imitating Hawking's voice box] I am.
Hawking:	I didn't say that.
Homer:		[still imitating] Yes I did.
		[the glove comes out again, bopping Homer in the
