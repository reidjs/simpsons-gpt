Cut from solo directly to driveway.

Driveway   :- Homer says `D'oh!' when Lisa scoots past.

Couch      :- Two thieves (complete with striped shirts and masks)
              are carting the couch away.  The family leap onto the
              couch, but the thieves dump OFF onto the floor and
              continue on their way.

The extra half-beat returns.  (Sigh.)

> Didja notice...
===============================================================================
    ... special guest voices included Aerosmith as themselves,
        Catherine O'Hara as the waitress,
        Phil Hartman as Lionel Hutz, and Marcia Wallace as Ms. K?
    ... between the floorboards are a pipe clearly labelled `lead'
        and insulation clearly labelled `asbestos'?
        There was also a dead rat in front of the insulation. {em}
    ... the girls were eating rice krispies/marshmallow treats at the
        slumber party?
        (Wouldn't this cause problems for the girl who wears braces?)
    ... Moe was cheating at solitaire?  [JYANOWITZ@hamp.hampshire.edu]
        He had placed two red cards atop each other.
        [Actually, I noticed that one pile didn't even have an up-card.
        And of course, Moe didn't bother to turn all the cards to face the
        same way before he shuffled them. --rjc]
    ... Bart ``paper bag head'' Simpson was hiding behind a paper bag?
    ... Marge's wig (identical to her regular hair) on the dresser?
    ... the mugger in front of Homer's new watering hole, The Aristocrat? {rc}

Did you remember to thank Mr. A. J. P. Martin when Dr. Fink used the gas
chromatograph?

Dave Hall {dh}:
    ... some of the people floating on the dead sea look more dead than alive?
    ... the table (with the gas chromatograph) disappeared after Martin's
        presentation?
    ... Ms. Krabappel's desk?  An apple core, and books which face away
        from her (so she can't read the title).
    ... the picture that Bart took out of the bag appears to be the one
        from the TV room?
    ... Krusty slipped money into Bernard's hand?
    ... the `live' lizard around Kent Brockman's date's neck?
        (Is she the weather girl?)
    ... the large mouse (rat?) hole in Moe's bedroom?  There are also
        lady's shoes on his side of the bed.
    ... how Marge handles her plate of bacon and eggs as she sat down?
        Note the look on her face.  (You need slo-mo or FF for this one.)

===============================================================================
> Mixed reviews
===============================================================================

Catherine Stanton {cs}:  What a classic.  It's a shame they're still
having the sappy endings.  I was hoping Moe would go broke or something.

inde6bc@JANE.UH.EDU:  What's with the sappy episodes, anyway? It seems like
every show this season has been capped with a sappy ending.  Still a
pretty good episode, though.  Bart's first kiss was a success.

Roby Sherman (rsherman@mthvax.cs.miami.edu):  Excellent episode.

Eric C. Williams (eric@npri6.npri.com):  Best of the season.  Just the
right balance of humor and darkness.  Loved the way the `normal' townsfolk
acquired alter egos in the bar.

Dora Kilburn {dk3}:  I thought it was just another episode.  There was
really nothing that was very memorable for me.  My biggest laugh was 
the couch scene.

Bryan Kelln {bk}:  An excellent episode. One of the best.

David Moery {dm}:  By far the best episode this season, and definitely one
of the all-time greats.

Scott Amspoker {sa}:  Excellent episode.  I laughed out loud many times
last night.

J. D. Baldwin {jdb}:  This episode was immediately catapulted into the
pantheon of the greats.  Right up there with `Itchy & Scratchy & Marge' and
`Bart the General'.  It even had an appearance by Scratchy!

Ron Carter {rc}:  Another superb episode; Lisa's PJ party was funny 'cause
it's true.

Yours Truly {rjc}:  Soopoib.  `Eye on Springfield' was great, but I fell
on the floor when Lisa's slumber party went after Bart.  Bart overturned
furniture to impede the girls' progress, just like they do on TV!  [J. D.
Baldwin {jdb} responds, ``TV, hell!  I have three younger sisters, and I
survived pre-adolescence only thanks to tricks very much like this one!'']
But the best part was easily The Song.  (They even had the car driving past
before the song starts.)  I've been singing that song for days now...

>>> The Words, transcribed with the help of Ron Carter {rc}

When the weight of the world has got you down
    and you want to end your life.
Bills to pay, a dead-end job,
    and problems with the wife.
But don't throw in the tow'l,
    'cuz there's a place right down the block...
Where you can drink your misery away...
At Flaming Moe's....            (Let's all go to Flaming Moe's...)
When liquor in a mug            (Let's all go to Flaming Moe's...)
    can warm you like a hug.                    (Flaming Moe's...)
And happiness is just a Flaming Moe away...
Happiness is just a Flaming Moe away...

>> Homer's hallucination

During Homer's wandering, he passes the TV shop.  On the screens appear:

  - the Chief of Police of Springfield
  - Krusty
  - Dr. Marvin Monroe
  - Kent Brockman
  - Scratchy getting a stick of dynamite in the mouth (the
    pictures cuts -right- before it blows up, damn)
  - an unidentified couple ready to kiss (ala a soap opera)

  + Even the bear under Jebediah Springfield looked like Moe.

===============================================================================
>> Door hinges

Sandra Ann Salinger (salins@aix.rpi.edu) points out that, since Bart's door
opens into the room, the hinges would be on the <inside> of the door, and
the girls couldn't have removed them.

>> Bart's escape

In `Bart vs. Thanksgiving' [7f07] we see that there is a tree within
easy climbing distance of Bart's window.  But in this episode, Bart
was forced to make a jump for it.

>> The slide show

First, we see Semla holding the slide projector's remote control, which is
panel-like, but later while Patty's holding it, it's depicted as being
trigger-like. {dh}

>> Moe's Tavern

All due to Dave Hall {dh}:

Moe is standing in front of Homer with the blender between them, yet when
Moe rolled the drink down the bar to the customer, the blender is to one
side of them.

The lid of the blender disappeared from Homer's hand when he poured the
two drinks, yet it appears later to be on the top of the blender.

Homer only made enough drink for him and Moe, but after the customer
complaints about the Love Tester, it appears that the blender is half full
again. (Taking into account the blender appeared to be empty for one
scene.)

For a couple of frames, Homer's hand passes under the drink. (i.e. drink
overlays Homer's hand.)

For some scenes, the bottles on the counter seem to move/disappear/change
shape.

After Moe places the towel over his shoulder, it disappeared after Mr.
Bannister asked about the inventor of the `Flaming Moe'.

A FF on Homer falling from the window shows several chain links
breaking--something that couldn't possibly happen.

>> Miscellaneous

Also due to Dave Hall {dh}

When the Camera pans from the TV room, it appears that Lisa's room is above
the TV room, yet later, from the back view of the house, Lisa's room is
over the kitchen.

The note-pad next to the phone only appeared when Bart wanted Homer to say
his name.

Bart threw the note-pad to the floor, yet when Lisa's friend pointed her
finger at Bart, the note-pad is nowhere to be seen.

The TV remote disappeared from the couch for one scene.

Only four girls went past Homer as they chased Bart.  (Where did the
fifth girl go?)

While Homer sat at the dining room table, his Duff beer is placed in
front of him, but you only see it during one scene only.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> A sappy ending?

Stephen L. Peters {slp}:  Where would Homer and Barney go?  Like any
sitcom, the rich get richer, and the poor get rich and then blow it all.

Jamie Ide {ji}:  How can you call that a sappy ending?  Moe was about to
close a million dollar deal and give half to Homer when Homer blew it.
Moe's was back to being a dive bar (I'm sure Moe squandered his profits)
and Homer still got no credit for inventing the Flaming Homer.  IMHO, that
was the least sappy ending so far this season.

>> Potent potables

>>> The Flaming Homer/Moe

Ron Carter {rc} politely provides the recipe:
    Tequila, Schnapps, Creme De Menthe, and the `secret' ingredient:
    Krusty's Non Narkotik Kough Syrup For Kids (``Doc'' Krusty on the label)

J. D. Baldwin {jdb} asks, ``If Moe had split the money and the credit for
the drink with Homer, would it have been called the Flaming Ho-Moe?''

>>> Virgin Moe

Sean Graves (sean@cs.tamu.edu) asks:  So if Lisa had a Virgin Moe, what
would that be?  Flaming cough syrup?  Hmmm.

>>> Harvey Wallbanger

In case you didn't know, the `Frank Wallbanger' joke was a reference to
this drink, consisting of orange juice, vodka, and Galiano.

>> Eye on Springfield

You'd have hoped that an Emmy-award-winning reporter wouldn't stoop to the
level of info-tainment.

J. D. Baldwin {jdb} observes that the episode originally aired during the
1991 November Sweeps.  ``This is <exactly> the kind of thing that those
`info-tainment' shows stoop to during sweeps.  I laughed until I stopped.
Not that I'm bad-mouthing bikini documentaries, you understand.''

>> The wax game

Theron Stanford {tws} thinks that that two different girls played the wax
game.  ``That's what was so funny--Lisa came up with a really clever idea
to make the one girl feel good, but then left the other girl hanging.''

>> The jinx

David Hyatt {dh2} explains:  ``If we say something at the same time,
whoever says JINX last has to be silent until someone says their name.
Played this all the time with my cousins.  Hours of amusement!''

>> Flaming Moe's bouncer

Some people have suggested that the bouncer was Dreaderick ``I really
[bleep]ed up bad'' Tatum, but I disagree.

(1) The bouncer's name was Bernard.
(2) Bernard has a deep voice.  Tatum has a high-pitched voice.

>> Ms. Krabappel

Catherine Stanton {cs}:  Just a word on Mrs. Krabappel (slut).  I've
always suspected that my teachers were like that after work.  Not only is
she a slut, but an ugly one at that.

Stephen L. Peters {slp}:  So far, we've seen Ms. K in the back seat of a
car with a sushi chef and trying to seduce Lisa's substitute teacher.  I'm
not surprised she'd start hanging around bars if the opportunity arose... 8^)

>> Bart's First Kiss?

Hardly, notes Chris Baird {cjb}.  He presents the Bart Simpson Kiss List:

    kisses    racing slip            [Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]
    kissed by Homer                  [Bart the Genius]
    kissed by Sherry and Terry       [Homer's Odyssey]
    kisses    Homer                  [There's No Disgrace Like Home]
    kissed by Marge                  [Jacques to be Wild]
    kissed by pretty French brunette [The Crepes of Wrath]
    kisses    Ms. Krabappel          [Bart Gets an F]
    kissed by Marge (in dream)       [Bart vs. Thanksgiving]
    kissed by Lisa                   [Bart vs. Thanksgiving]
    kissed by Marge                  [Bart the Daredevil]
    kissed by Homer (twice)          [One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish]
    kissed by pretty lady            [Saturdays of Thunder]
    kissed by `Susan'                [Flaming Moe]

>> Maggie's First Word?

General consensus is that Maggie's ``Moe'' existed only in Homer's
hallucination and therefore doesn't count.  (Similar to her, ``It's your
fault I can't talk!'' in `Bart vs. Thanksgiving'.)  Some believe that
Maggie actually did say something, but Homer heard it as `Moe'.  Contrary
evidence:  (1) The rest of the family didn't seem to react much to Maggie's
alleged first word.  (2) Homer later hallucinated talking daisies, which
means that he can hallucinate things that simply don't exist.

>> Marge's sarcasm

I was actually mildly shocked by Marge's outburst of sarcasm.  (Which made
it all the funnier, of course.)  Seemed out of character for her.

>> Aerosmith

Mike Berman {msb} identifies the closing music as `Young Lust' from their
album `Pump'.

I don't know the scientific explanation, but FIRE MADE IT GOOD.
-- Homer creates a new drink, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Moe invites Homer to make a `Flaming Homer'.  Homer needs cough syrup,
% and Moe goes through the lost-and-found.  He turns up some cough syrup.
% It's rather bland, but after you light it...

Wow, Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everybody's invited!
-- Moe tastes a Flaming Homer, ``Flaming Moe's''

% The customer asks what it's called.  Homer explains, ``It's called
% a Flaming...''  Moe quickly interrupts, ``Moe.  It's called a Flaming
% Moe.  That's right, a Flaming Moe.  My name is Moe, and I invented it.
% That's why it's called a Flaming Moe.  What, what are you looking at
% Homer?  It's a Flaming Moe, I'm Moe.''
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 7:00]
%
% Moe's Tavern is packed with customers, all drinking Flaming Moe's.

Barney: [discovers the salad bar]  Hey, what's this?
Moe:    A sneeze guard.
Barney: [sneezes, spewing snot all over the sneeze guard] Wow, it really works!
-- An ounce of prevention, ``Flaming Moe's''

Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down
on you for accepting food stamps.
-- Homer, ``Flaming Moe's''

% It's clear the it's the Flaming Moe that is drawing the customers.
% A pretty woman applies for the waitress position and gets it (after
% some lascivious comments from Moe and an insulting rejoinder).
% ``You shan't regret this.''  Harv Bannister from Tipsy McStagger's
% Good-Time Drinking and Eating Emporium offers to buy the recipe.
% (Moe doesn't quite understand that `Tipsy McStagger' is merely the
% name of the company; he thinks there really is a Mr. McStagger.)

The Flaming Moe is not for sale.  Do you know how much of my blood
and sweat are in this drink?
[everybody in the bar spits out their drink]
Uh, figure of speech.
-- Moe refuses to sell out, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Mr. Bannister surreptitiously pours a Flaming Moe into a container for
% future analysis.  Barney is pleased.  ``Good for you, Moe.  Only an
% idiot would give away a million-dollar idea like that!''  Homer is not
% pleased.  At school...

Martin: So the next time you use a gas chromatograph, remember to thank
        Mr. A. J. P. Martin.
Ms. K:  [applauding]  Oh, brilliant, Martin, brilliant!  Once again, you've
        wrecked the grading curve.  Oh, I pity the poor student who has
        to follow you.  [consults her sheet]  Bart Simpson, you're next.
-- ``Inventors We Admire'' day, ``Flaming Moe's''

The Inventor I Admire, by Bart Simpson.
The inventor I admire is not a rich man or a famous man or even a smart
man.  He's my father, Homer Simpson.
-- ``Flaming Moe's''

% Bart proclaims that Homer invented the Flaming Homer, but everybody
% knows that Moe invented it.

Bart: My father invented that drink, and if you'll allow me to demonstrate...
      [pulls out of brown paper bag a blender and bottles of liquor]
Ms.K: Bart, are those liquor bottles?
Bart: [as if this excused it] I brought enough for everybody.
Ms.K: Take those to the teachers' lounge!  You can have what's left at the
      end of the day.
-- ``Inventors We Admire'' day, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Moe makes the cover of magazines with his new drink.
% At the Simpsons dinner table, Lisa asks if, instead of milk, she can have
% a Virgin Moe, and Homer growls.  Bart arrives with a `I got toasted at
% Flaming Moe's' T-shirt.  Homer orders Bart to take it off, so he does.
% Bart eats dinner shirtless.  Marge suggests Homer talk to Moe.  Homer
% refuses.  Too upset to eat, he decides to go to Moe's.  (``D'oh!'')
% But he can't get past the bouncer.  Inside Moe introduces his new friends.

Moe:       How about a warm Flaming Moe's welcome for... Aerosmith!
Aerosmith: Nah, I don't think so Moe, we're just hanging out, etc.
Moe:       C'mon guys, free pickled eggs!
Aerosmith: Awright!  Yeah!  [head onstage]
-- The price of fame?  ``Flaming Moe's''

% They play `Walk This Way'.  Karl and Len enjoy their Flaming Moe's, but
% Len forgets to extinguish the flames before he drinks it.  His hair
% catches on fire as a result.  Jasper is in the crowd.  Otto dances with
% Princess Cashmere atop the table the Flanderses are at.  Homer sneaks
% in the bathroom window and is surprised to see a well-dressed Barney.
% Barney introduces his friends Armondo and Ralphy.  Moe joins Aerosmith
% on stage.

Ms.K:  [heavy make-up, in a tube top]  Hiya, scrumptious.
       Do you want to ignite my drink?
Homer: You're my kid's teacher!
Ms.K:  Single parent, are we?
Homer: No!
Ms.K:  [lasciviously]  Well, let's pretend you are...

      Hugh.
Moe:  Uh, hold on, I'll check.  [calling]  Hugh Jass!  Somebody check the
      men's room for a Hugh Jass!
Hugh: Uh, I'm Hugh Jass.
Moe:  Telephone.  [hands over the receiver]
Hugh: Hello, this is Hugh Jass.
Bart: [surprised]  Uh, hi.
Hugh: Who's this?
Bart: Bart Simpson.
Hugh: Well, what can I do for you, Bart?
Bart: Uh, look, I'll level with you, Mister.  This is a crank call that
      sort of backfired, and I'd like to bail out right now.
Hugh: All right.  Better luck next time. [hangs up]  What a nice young man.
-- Nobody's perfect, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Moe explains to Homer that it's nothing personal. ``This is business.''

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:16]

When the weight of the world has got you down
    and you want to end your life.
Bills to pay, a dead-end job,

But don't throw in the tow'l,
    'cuz there's a place right down the block...
Where you can drink your misery away...
At Flaming Moe's....            (Let's all go to Flaming Moe's...)

And happiness is just a Flaming Moe away...
Happiness is just a Flaming Moe away...

-- Cheers to ... ``Flaming Moe's''

% Harv returns and offers Moe $1 million for the drink, warning that

secret ingredient is...  Love!?  Who's been screwing with this thing!
-- Prof. John Fink's attempt to discover the recipe for a Flaming Moe,

% Marge and Homer pay a visit to Lionel Hutz.

Marge: So, Mr. Hutz, does my husband have a case?
Hutz:  I'm sorry, Mrs. Simpson, but you can't copyright a drink.
Homer: [whines]  Oh!
Hutz:  This all goes back to the Frank Wallbanger case of '78.
       How about that!  I looked something up!
       These books behind me don't just make the office look good,
       they're filled with useful legal tidbits just like that!
-- The Great Hutzby, ``Flaming Moe's''

% At home...

Homer: [grumbles]  Stupid Moe, non-inventing, recipe-stealing, pug-nosed...
Marge: Well, Homer, maybe you can get some consolation in the fact that
       something you created is making so many people happy.
Homer: [sickly sweet]  Oh, look at me!  I'm making people happy!
       I'm the Magical Man from Happy-Land, in a gumdrop house on
       Lollipop Lane!  [leaves the room, slamming the door]

-- Moe Better Blues (or... Persistence of Moe-mory), ``Flaming Moe's''

% Still mumbling, ``Moe... Moe..'', Homer wanders trance-like out into
% downtown Springfield, where everybody (even the women and the kids)
% are likenesses of Moe.  He falls down in the grass, and even the nearby
% daisies have Moe's face.  Homer screams in panic.
%
% At Moe's, Aerosmith are entertaining the customers, then realize that
% Joey is missing.

Joey: Mrs. Krabappel, I really need my drumsticks.
Ms.K: [lasciviously playing with the drumsticks]  Come and get 'em...
-- ``Flaming Moe's''

% Moe agrees to sell, and Harv confides that their usual method is merely
% to steal the recipe.  Before Moe can sign, a voice cackles from the rafters.
% It's Homer.  ``Fools!  You poor, pathetic misguided creatures...''  Despite
% Moe's attempt to stop him, Homer reveals the secret ingredient as cough
% syrup.  Harv quickly takes the contract and tears it up.  (``Thank you,
% Mister Nutball.'')  Laughing diabolically, Homer loses his balance and
% falls to the floor.  Says Barney, ``Holy cow!  You just fell on Aerosmith!''
%
% One week later, the town is filled with Flaming Moe's knockoffs.
