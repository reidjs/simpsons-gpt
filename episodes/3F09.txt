===============================================================================
(Thanks to Benjamin Robinson for transcribing this Gannett News Services
article which appeared in newspapers on 14-Jan-96, the day the episode
aired.)

Add Bob Newhart, Donald Sutherland and golfer Tom Kite to the growing
list of "The Simpsons" guest stars -- but not George and Barbara Bush.

During February sweeps, Kite appears in an episode where Homer learns to
play golf (Feb. 4); Newhart plays himself when Krusty the Clown is
audited by the IRS (Feb. 11); and Sutherland plays a historian
researching city founder Jebidiah Springfield (Feb. 18).

Former President George Bush and Barbara Bush move to Springfield,
"where nobody cares about politics," says Bill Oakley, an executive
producer.

Versatile Harry Shearer -- the voice of Principal Skinner, Rev. Lovejoy,
Montgomery Burns and Ned Flanders -- provides Bush's voice.

"We didn't even ask (the Bushes).  We didn't think they'd do it for us,"
Oakley says.

In the show, Bart constantly pesters his new neighbors, while Homer is
jealous over Springfield's attention to the former first family.

"It's quite wacky, but it's one of our all-time favorite episodes,"
Oakley says.

===============================================================================
> Reviews
===============================================================================
John Murray: Grade: A-.  This Episode had a decent plot and gags that
    worked well with the plot.  One thing missing in this episode was a
    clearly different secondary plot.  Also there weren't as many ROFL
    gags as other shows.  But overall this show is better then some
    others we have seen recently.

Nelson Seggley: No subplot, no character gags, and no self-satirization.
    Instead, the writers choose to linger on petty and pointless
    political jokes.  No one knows who Bush is, Homer resents him,
    etc...SO BAD.  Letter grade: D+\C-.

Haynes Lee: One of the better shows of the season.  It reminds me of the
    old "Dennis the Menace" comic books where Dennis torments his old
    neighbor Mr. Wilson while Mrs. Wilson is always baking Dennis
    cookies.  Homer acting like a boor was a real bonus.  Grade: A+.

Mark Richey: This has to be the most bizarre show of the year.  It also
    was pretty bad.  The concept of having the Bushes move into the
    neighborhood was pretty dumb to begin with, and they made it worse
    by sticking a cliched plot onto it (Bart annoys Bush?  Bush and
    Homer get into a feud?  Wow, originality!)  Pretty lame.  Grade: D.

Ondre Lombard: Bart is an unsophisticated, totally out of character,
    immature little brat who does things like disrespect his neighbor
    and Homer is at an all-time worst.  The slam on Bush is unspeakably
    tasteless.  Laced with flat-jokes, empty-dialogue and mindless gags
    that go nowhere.  Shameful.  D-.

Tony Hill: OFF's latest effort at annoying Republicans from coast to
    coast gets a big A!  This ep was a non-stop riot, featuring just the
    right mix of gags and parody.  We got to see Bart and Homer team up
    like the good old bad old days.  And Bush learned once more why
    Americans should be less like the Simpsons.

Jason Hancock: Mediocre.  It had a few funny moments, mostly at the
    beginning of the show, but overall it was little more than a Dennis
    the Menace parody which happened to feature a former President of
    the United States.  It was ironic, though, to see Ned Flanders, a
    man Homer dislikes, resemble Bush.  Grade: C.

Chris Schwalje: FOX should've pre-empted this episode indefinitely
    instead of just one hour.  This episode was unfunny, mean-spirited,
    out-of-character, and I absolutely abhorred it.  Worst Simpsons
    episode ever?  Do you HAVE to ask?  If there was a lower grade it
    would get it: F.

Ed Taylor: This was probably the strangest episode I have seen.  Why
    didn't they just go ahead and do a "Dennis The Menace" show.  I'm
    not going so far as to call this one bad, but it certainly was
    strange.

Damain Penny: I'll admit that the episode probably didn't go as far as
    it could have, but it had some great laughs.  I give it a B+.  As
    far as Simpsons political satire goes, though, it was no "Sideshow
    Bob Roberts".

Chris Courtois: Every season has at least one clunker, and last night
    gave us season seven's.  Start with what had to be the dumbist
    premise since "Bart Gets an Elephant", add in the most annoying
    elements of the past two seasons and you get last night's show.  D-.

Keith Palmer: I disliked the poor gags and unpleasant characterization
    of Homer in the first part of this episode.  However, the sheer
    sillyness of the last part swept me along until I was laughing at
    such unlikely events such as Bart and Homer gluing a clown wig on
    Bush's head.  Grade: B-.

Nathan Dietz: A slight, but funny episode.  If you find the idea of
    calling one's wife "Bar" inherently funny, you'll like this episode
    as much as I did.  Not great because the humor was too heavy-handed
    (a trademark of the writing the last two seasons), but seeing George
    pay Homer back in kind for the fright-wig stunt _was_ great.  A
    solid B+.

Benjamin Robinson: Fans of silly humor will love this episode; realists
    (like me) will think it's too wacky by about half.  Harry Shearer's
    turn as George Bush lifted this out of the mediocre range for me.
    Good Bush presidency references, if anyone can remember that far
    back.  (B-)

Ricardo Lafaurie: Similar to "The Springfield Connection", the episode
    "Two Bad Neighbors" had a lot going for it, but threw it away for
    weak, unfunny gags.  The whole thing seemed to be a "Dennis the
    Menace" twist, and I don't even like "Dennis".  Word of advice to
    OFF staff: get rid of Ken Keeler.  Grade: D-.

Yours truly: Keeler also wrote "A Star is Burns" (2F31), and I liked
    this episode in the same way as that one.  A bit surreal, injecting
    Bush into the Simpsons, but his scowling cantankerousness dealing
    with Bart and Homer were hilariously done.  Harry Shearer, you the
    man!  Grade: B.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Car watch

Benjamin Robinson opines, "At least two non-generic cars graced this
    episode.  The pink two-door hardtop Homer and Bart walk past is a
    1979 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.  Note the forward slant of the grill,
    the two (as opposed to four) headlights, and the forward-slanting
    rear fender bulge.  Apu's car is immediately recognizable as a 1980
    (or 1981, there were few changes in those two years) Pontiac
    Firebird.  Sharp-eyed Pontiac fans will notice that, in the street-
    level shot where Apu soaks Bart, the car has lost its lower two
    grille openings."

>> Homer's singing

Tony Hill says:

    - "`Big Spender' was written by Dorothy Fields and Cy Coleman for
      the Broadway musical `Sweet Charity.'  It was sung by Gwen
      Verdon."
    - "`Stayin' Alive' was one of many hits for the Bee Gees from
      `Saturday Night Fever,' and I think Dan Castellaneta did a superb
      job of singing it."

>> U. S. News and World Report

Don Del Grande writes, "A few years ago, USN&WR did a TV commercial
    which showed `Time' and `Newsweek' with the Simpsons on the covers
    and asked the viewers whether they wanted that or `real news' in
    their news magazines."

>> Abe and Grover Cleveland

Mark Richey says, "Grover Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th President.  He
    was the only one to serve two non-consecutive terms.  He was elected
    in 1884, but was defeated by Benjamin Harrison in 1888.  In 1892, he
    ran again, and won re-election.  He retired in 1897.  If Abe is not
    lying, that means he's at least 100, making him older than Mr.
    Burns."
    
    Don Del Grande adds, "Cleveland actually got more votes than
    Benjamin Harrison in his first reelection attempt, but the way the
    votes were distributed, Harrison won enough states to have a
    majority of the Electoral Votes."

>> Edmund Scientific

John Murray notes, "This is a real scientific supply house, but last
    time I a saw a catalog, they didn't sell locusts."

>> Gorbachev's Russian

Serge Polishchuk translates, "`Nooo, znayet moj nachalnik this' is half-
    Russian for `Ohhh, wait till my boss hears about this!'"  Brandon
    Shaw disagrees, claiming a better translation is, "Well, we know who
    the boss is here."

>> Gerald Ford

Tony Hill writes, "Gerald Ford was the only unelected President.  He
    became Vice President after the resignation of (MAD magazine
    staffer?)  Spiro Agnew in 1973 and succeeded to the presidency upon
    the resignation of Richard Nixon the next year.  He had been a
    football player in college.  Even more than pardoning Nixon or
    denying aid to New York City, his biggest mistake was falling down
    thw steps of Air Force One in 1975.  When NBC's `Saturday Night'
    premiered later that year, Chevy Chase used falling to demonstrate
    to the audience that he was imitating Ford.  It became so popular
    that Chase fell down at the start of every episode as his trademark.
    This contributed to an image of Ford as a bumbler."

>> George Herbert Walker Bush: inside jokes explained

Tony Hill explains the following jokes about Bush:

    - "Bush indeed claimed to be from many states.  These are the ones I
      recall: He was born in Massachusetts; he grew up in Connecticut,
      from which his father served in the Senate; he began his business
      career with a small oil company in Ohio; he made his economic and
      political fortunes in Texas (from which he served, although his
      official residence was a Houston hotel); he lived in Virginia
      while director of the CIA; and he maintains a vacation home in
      Kennebunkport, Maine."  Brian Kalt says Bush _actually_ maintains
      residency in only Texas and Maine, with Texas being the official
      one.
        - Benjamin Robinson adds further, "During the 1988 Presidential
          campaign, the public discovered that while Bush lived in
          Kennebunkport, Maine, he claimed that he really lived in
          Texas.  Presumably, this was to take advantage of Texas' lack
          of a state income tax.  Although perfectly legal, may people
          felt that this was sort of cheating.  In Bush's defense, he
          _does_ have ties to Texas: he ran an oil company there after
          World War II, and his son is the current governor of that
          state."
    - "Bush's dog (either Millie or Ranger) was running with the group.
      (Perhaps that's why SLH joined?)"
    - "As Bush was about to tell Bart, Robert Mosbacher was Secretary of
      Commerce in the Bush Administration."
    - "Bush served in the Navy in World War II.  He flew forty-some
      bombing missions and was shot down by the Japanese."
    - "Bush's 1988 campaign was early dogged by the perception that Bush
      was a wimp.  This image was shattered in January of that year as
      Bush trounced Dan Rather in a planned ambush interview on the CBS
      Evening News.  Some suggested that the three armed invasions Bush
      undertook (Panama, Iraq, Somalia) were further efforts to shed the
      `wimp' image."  Aaron Varhola adds, "On the cover of Newsweek in
      spring of 1988 it showed Bush at the helm of a boat, with the
      headline `Fighting the Wimp Factor'.  This was the most
      embarrassing Bush moment, much like Michael Dukakis at the helm of
      a tank (parodied in 7F01)."
    - "George and Jeb are Bush's political sons.  The former beat Ann
      Richards to become Governor of Texas in 1994; at the same time,
      the latter lost a race for the Florida governorship.  (Sadly, OFF
      made no effort to skewer Neil Bush, who made out like a bandit in
      the savings and loan debacle.)"
    - "`Bush in the sewer' was a reference to the 1988 campaign, which
      Bush, at the behest of his late adviser Lee Atwater, turned into
      the dirtiest presidential campaign of the 20th century.  (Atwater
      was shelved after starting a rumor campaign that Smithers ...er,
      House Speaker Tom Foley was gay.)"
    - "Manuel Noriega was deposed as "leader" of Panama after the Bush
      Administration invaded Panama to capture him for trial in the
      U.S."
    - "Bush was director of the CIA under Gerald Ford in 1976 and 1977.
      Mikhail Gorbachev was leader of the Soviet Union during Bush's
      presidency, until his country went out of business on December 21,
      1991."
    - "Bush vomited on the Japanese Prime Minister during a state
      banquet in Tokyo in January 1992.  He blamed a virus, but word was
      that it was caused by halcion withdrawal."
    - "Bush pledged `Read my lips: No new taxes!' during the 1988
      campaign, but agreed to a tax hike on the wealthiest taxpayers in
      1990 as part of a compromise with Democrats."
    - "J.  Danforth Quayle, formerly the junior senator from Indiana,
      served as Bush's Vice President, and was much maligned for being
      perceived as airheaded."

Benjamin Robinson adds some notes of his own:

    - "`Not gonna happen:' George Bush is famous for saying this.  Or
      rather, comedian and Bush impersonator Dana Carvey is famous for
      saying this.  It was a fixture in many of his George Bush sketches
      for `Saturday Night Live.'  As for Mr. Bush himself, I think he
      said it just once.  Some days, it just doesn't pay to open your
      mouth..."
    - "The cookie wars: During the 1992 campaign, Hillary Clinton
      defended her non-traditional, activist role by saying she was out
      doing important things, rather than just staying home baking
      cookies all day.  Housewives across the country were promptly
      alienated.  Eventually both Ms.  Clinton and Mrs. Bush published
      recipes in that great journal of American politics, `Good
      Housekeeping.'

% Homer flings slime in his eyes, runs around the side of the sewer, and
% body slams Bush.  "Yay, Dad!" cheers Bart.
%
% Marge has invited Bar over for tea.

Barbara: I really feel awful about your lawn, Marge.  George can be so
         stubborn when he thinks he's right.
  Marge: Well, Homer, too.  They're so much alike.
Barbara: Too bad they got off on the wrong foot.  It's just like the
         Noriega thing.  Now, he and George are the best of friends.
-- Bygones, "Two Bad Neighbors"

% Under the street, Homer and George pant.  Bush removes a piece from
% his watch and pulls out a length of piano wire.  "Here's a little
% something we learned in CIA," he grins.  Bart releases the locusts on
% Bush, inciting them to "Get him, boys!"  Above-ground, Mikhail
% Gorbachev brings a gift to Bush's house and rings the doorbell.
% "Hello?  Hello!"
%
% The sewer grate pops off, and out come Homer and Bush, still fighting.

 George: I'll ruin you like a Japanese banquet!  I'll take your head and
         -- Gorbachev!  Heh, what are you doing here?
Mikhail: I just dropped by with present for warming of house.  Instead,
         find you grappling with local oaf.
  Homer: Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight
         dirty, eh?
 George: But Mikhail, they put a wig on my head, my memoirs --
Barbara: George!  This is the last straw.  You apologize to Homer right
         now!
 George: But Bar, [quietly] we can't show any weakness in front of the
         Russians.
Barbara: [reproachful] George...
 George: [pause] Yes, dear.
Mikhail: [speaks Russian to his driver, and laughs]
-- No translation needed, "Two Bad Neighbors"

George: I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer.
 Homer: Woo hoo!  In your face, Bush.  Now apologize for the tax hike.
-- Giving him an inch..., "Two Bad Neighbors"

% Bush frowns, and walks off.
%
% Barbara goes to say goodbye to Marge.

Barbara: It's a shame it didn't work out, Marge, but George just felt
         this neighborhood brought out the worst in him, and --
          [Bush honks his horn impatiently]
         -- oh, my.  Well, so long.
          [Bar gets in; they drive off]
  Marge: Bye bye.
-- So endeth another chapter, "Two Bad Neighbors"

% No sooner have the Bushes departed that another moving truck pulls in
% along with a car with license plate "Mr. Duh".

Gerry: Hi!  Pleased to meet you, I just moved in.  My name is Gerry
       Ford.
Homer: [gasps] Former President Gerald Ford?  Put her there!  I'm Homer
       Simpson!
Gerry: Say, Homer, do you like football?
Homer: Do I ever!
Gerry: Do you like nachos?
Homer: Yes, Mr. Ford.
Gerry: Well, why don't you come over and watch the game, and we'll have
       nachos?  And then, some beer.
Homer: Ooh!
        [they walk across the street]
       Gerry, I think you and I are going to get along just --
        [they both trip]
 Both: D'oh!
