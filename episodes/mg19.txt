    Voice credits:
        NANCY CARTWRIGHT as Bart
        YEARDLEY SMITH as Lisa

    Animators were Wesley Archer, Bill Kopp, and David Silverman.

    The credits list the casting director as BONNIE PIETILA rather
    than BONITA PIETILA.

Brian Howard {bh} gives the timing for this short as 1:41, whereas the
syndication package contains only 1:38 of animation.  My guesses at
the cuts:  1/2 second from Bart's ``Aw'', 3/4 second from the end
of act one, and 3/4 second from the end of act three.

G: Gather 'round, kids.  And I'll tell you about the good ol' days.

% The kids hop into his lap.

B: {Aw,} man!

% Through Grampa's story, Bart has one of those, ``I've heard this before''
% expressions.  Lisa and Maggie are entertained.

G: You know, when I was your age, I had to walk twenty miles just to get
   to school.  And back then, we didn't have pacifiers.  We had to suck on
   pieces of wood.  And in my day, we didn't have TV sets.  We used to sit
   on our grandpa's lap all evening and listen politely to his entertaining
   stories.
B: Was your grandpa a liar too?
G: No, but his lap was awful slippery!

% Grampa playfully pushes Bart off his lap.  Bart lands with a thud.

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:32]

% The girls are in Grampa's lap.  Bart bounces a red ball.

G: Once upon a time, there was a happy little elf.
B: [annoyed] Can't something bad happen to the elf?
G: The happy little elf hummed a happy little tune.
B: Aw, come on, man!
G: But suddenly, the happy little elf STOPPED!

% Bart is startled, and the ball crashes through the window.

G: You want it scary, eh?
B: That's right, old timer.
G: This is a story... of a very...   Wauugh!

% Grampa's eyes go haywire, and he throws his arms wide, tossing the
% girls to the floor.  He then slumps in his chair.
%
% The girls stand next to Bart.

L: You killed Grandpa.
B: [panicking]  No way, man!  Society killed Grandpa!
