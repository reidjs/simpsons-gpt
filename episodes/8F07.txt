which was cut to make room for the premiere of a Michael Jackson video.
The uncut version will likely appear when the episode repeats.

Cut from clouds directly to driveway.

Driveway   :- Homer says `D'oh!' when Lisa scoots past.

Couch      :- The bottom cushions are missing, but they don't notice until
              it's too late.

In an alternate universe:

Blackboard :- Hamsters cannot fly.

Lisa's solo:- slightly freer variation on the second season solo

Couch      :- Same as US version.

> Mixed reviews
===============================================================================

[JYANOWITZ@hamp.hampshire.edu]:  Sappyness seems to continue, but there
were some great moments...

David Willard {dw}: Excellent episode!!!  I thought it was going to turn
out to be another one of those sappy ending we've been seeing lately, but
Nah nah na-nah naaah!!!!

David Hyatt {dh2}:  Generally a less than average episode, I thought.
Mainly suffered from inconsistencies with the previous episode, Lisa's
Pony.  Why two episodes in a row about Homer realizing he's a bad father?
How could he forget what he had learned just one week ago?  [Brian Scearce
{bls} responds, ``Simpson, eh?'']

Ron Carter {rc}:  Good stuff until the simpy end; quit it with the thousand
points o' kinder gentler Simpsons stuff!

Dora Kilburn {dk3}:  Well, not the greatest episode, but it sure had a lot
of VERY funny little things.

Scott Amspoker {sa}:  To me, a good Simpsons episode has to have at least
one scene that leaves me stunned.  Watching Martin running ablaze from his
firey soapbox accident made the episode for me.

Yours Truly {rjc}:  When I saw the names Ken Levine and David Isaacs, I
said to myself, ``Okay, this is going to be one awesome episode.''  Alas,
it was merely adequate.  (The program-length advertisement was expertly
handled, though.)  A truly great Simpsons episode is one in which OFF end
up poorer but wiser.

>> McBain

    the diner was named Sloppy Joe's
  + McBain legs sort of dragged under his seat.
  + One extra fork was place in the counter. (Salad fork?)
  + Skowie's gun fell easily out of its holster while he was getting shot-up.
    It fell into McBain's lap, yet you don't see it again throughout the
    rest of the clip.
  + As the hit-man was making his get-away, a person was hiding under the
    counter.
  + The Special was: Ribs & Fries ($3.99) & Hot Link Fries ($1.99)
  + Skowie's tongue was hanging out of his month (in true cartoon fashion).
  + McBain's hotdog was the only thing that was touched by broken glass, or
    blood.  (I wonder if he's still going to eat it...)

  + Homer stole some pop-corn while he watched McBain.

>> The National Fatherhood Institute

    Father practicing teaching his son how to ride a bicycle.
    Father practicing fishing with his son.
    Father plays catch with his son, as a computer wire-model
        records the scene.
    `Underwater Fathering'.  Unfortunately, a shark attacks the son.
        ``Dear God!  Not again!''

    Note that the institute should be more properly named the National
    Father-and-Son Institute.  There were no father/daughter scenes
    anywhere in the institute.

>> At the track

    Bart's car:  Lil' Lightnin'
        A pile of junk

        The front is shaped like a shark's head
        A person locked in the trunk.  (ballast?)
      - A `No 55' sticker
      + Nelson had a ``55 speed limit ban'' sticker on his cart.

    Martin's second car: the Homer Roller
        General Dynamics sticker
        A speedometer sticker, which peeled off when Bart drove. {dk3}

>> Sometimes there's a knock at the door, other times there's a doorbell.
[8f05] Krusty knocks on the door, but Milhouse rings the doorbell.
[8f07] Patty and Selma knock on the door.

>> Why would Martin's car burst into flames?  Was he secretly powering his
car with gasoline?  David A. Berson {dab} observes that the nose of
Martin's space shuttle was heating up and turning red, much like the space
shuttle on re-entry.  Must have had defective heat tiles.

>> Homer owns a Beta VCR in [8f06], but here, we see him paying a visit
to the VHS Village.

>> In the McBain clip, the bad-guy motorcyclist drove past the daily
special sign twice. [John Mastrangelo (ice@ntia.its.bldr.nist.gov)]

For a brief moment, the picture in McBain's partner's hand disappeared. {dh}

Of course, these could be considered goofs in McBain, not Simpsons goofs.

>> Miscellaneous

Due to Dave Hall {dh}

Homer reached for the sugar cubes bare-handed, yet we later see tongs in
his hand.

The chair (that was thrown at Nick Riviera) disappeared at the corner of
the screen.

Note that when Homer opened the door, the door on the house behind Homer
had two window panes, yet when the camera closed in on Homer's face, they
turned into 1 pane.

A book is missing from the in-table beside the couch. (There's normally 3.)

Everyone knows (at least on the net) that the kitchen faces the back of the
house, yet Ned was seen through the kitchen window. (i.e. Ned would have to
be in the Simpson's back yard rather than his own yard.)

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================

>> McBain

>>> References

David Hyatt {dh2}:  How many `black/white' buddy movies have such scenes
as in McBain?  Off the top of my head, there's Lethal Weapon, Predator,
well... actually name any movie with Danny Glover, other than `Pure Luck'.

>>> Seeing it coming

Marc Colten {mc} observes:

What made that scene especially funny is that it fit so perfectly
with action movies conventions:

     1.  He was the partner of the indestructible hero (e.g., any
         Arnold Schwartznegger picture, or Dirty Harry.)
     2.  He was black.  (I've seen a few of those pictures - NEVER be
         from an ethnic minority and partner those guys. :-) )
     3.  Most importantly he said the magic words ``Yeah, in two days
         I'm retiring...''

I instantly knew the guy was toast.

>> Music

>>> `Cat's in the Cradle' by Harry Chapin (NFI hold music)

Kenneth Herron {kh} explains that ``the song was released during the early
70's I believe.  The words tell the story of a man who never has time for
his son while he's growing up.  When the son grows up, he [the son] never
has time for his dad.  It's a very poignant song; Homer in his vulnerable
state started sniffling when he heard it.''

>>> ... Oh, you are one in a million ... (NFI background music)

>>> `Watching Scottie Grow' circa 1972 {rs}

    ``There he sits with a pen and a yellow pad.
      What a handsome lad.  That's my boy.''
        -- during the car-building montage

Laurence H. Palter {lhp} believes the song was done by Bobby Goldsboro.

Paul Thrasher (slan@darkside.com) adds:  Mac Davis wrote it, decided it
wasn't something he could record.  Goldsboro recorded it, made a mint, and
now tells jokes about Mac Davis' son claiming to really be Goldsboro's
child.

>>> `The Wind Beneath My Wings', as the NFI celebrate Bart's victory

>> Cosby references

David Hyatt {dh2}:  One brilliant reference was the taking of the baby
carriage wheels to make the go cart racers with.  This is a blatant
reference to a stand-up routine by Bill Cosby, in which all the kids in
his neighborhood build go-carts from baby carriage wheels and ride them
down Dead Man's Hill.  So in that one episode, you had ``Bill Cosby saved
the Simpsons'', ``Fatherhood'', Dr. Hibbert, <and> a take-off of one of
Cosby's own old standup routines.  [Don't forget the quasi-Cosby sweater
Homer tried to wear.  --rjc]

>> Mark A. Holtz {mah} asks, ``Why were Homer and Bart wearing Arc Welding
helmets for Oxy-Acetlyne welding?  (Not to mention that they were wearing
them the wrong way.)''

>> Was I the only one who thought that `F.Q.' was an attempt to reference
a more vulgar version of ``Eat my shorts''?

% The cars are poised at the top of the hill, and before Martin can express

% to attack Bart, leaving Martin to zoom past both of them in his space
% shuttle car.  Martin wins easily (all the while screaming for his life).
% Nelson comes in second.  Bart's car clunks to a stop a few feet short of
% the finish line.  Martin frantically presses the `Parachute' button, but
% the parachute doesn't deploy.  It finally does... after he crashes into a
% wall.  The car bursts into flames, and Martin rushes out, his clothes on

% Homer drops Lisa off at the office and becomes furious when he spots Martin.
% Martin makes his escape.
%
% Bart leaves for the race.

Bart:  Dad, aren't you coming?
Homer: No!
Marge: Now, don't pout.
Homer: I'm not pouting.  <You> are!
-- ``Saturdays of Thunder''

% Even the Foam Doam (equipped with cans of Duff) doesn't help.  Marge
% expresses her profound disappointment.
%
% Homer watches the race coverage on TV.  His Duffs empty, Homer pays the
% fridge a visit for a refill.  He spots the list and goes down the items.
% This time, he can answer them!  Except for question three.  He spots
% Flanders and asks him, ``When should a boy start dating?''  Before Ned
% can finish his reply, Homer yells, ``Thanks'' and dashes off.  ``I'm
% a perfect father!''

Barney: My friend [Moe] and I have a bet.  Are you Mary Tyler Moore?
Patty:  [maces him]
Barney: Waugh! [belch]  Ooh, wow!  It really <is> you!
-- ``Saturdays of Thunder''

Martin: Bart, if she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands
        or else you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators.
        [notices Bart isn't paying attention]
        Bart, what did I just tell you?
Bart:   Kill spectators.
-- ``Saturdays of Thunder''

Martin: What is the matter with you!
Bart:   It's my dad.  Lying there on the couch, drinking a beer, staring
        at the TV... I've never seen him like that.
-- A change of environment, ``Saturdays of Thunder''

% Martin yells, ``You're driving for <me> now!'' and slaps Bart.
% Bart spots Homer in the stands.  ``Do it for your old man, boy!''
%
% `Diamond' Joe Quimby has the honor of dropping the starting flag.

To everyone participating today, I salute your vigor.
[aside]  Check out the rack on the blonde in the fourth row!
-- `Diamond' Joe Quimby takes a cue from the Kennedys,
   ``Saturdays of Thunder''

% He drops the flag, and Bart and Nelson race downhill.  All watch excitedly,
% except for Maggie, who finds a nearby balloon more interesting.  Nelson's
% tires are equipped with rotating blades, which he uses to attack Bart's
% car, but Bart wins anyway.  His pit crew dump a bucket of Gatorade over
% him.  Nelson attacks his own pit crew.  Bart receives a congratulatory
% kiss from a pretty lady.  Diamond Joe Quimby has found the blonde in the
% fourth row.

The world has not seen the likes of this since the French carried
Lucky Lindy off on their shoulders from Le Bourget Field.
-- Soap box derby announcer, ``Saturdays of Thunder''

% Bart is presented the trophy by Ronny Beck, and he (and Homer) take
% the rare victory as an opportunity to taunt Nelson.  Father and son
% embrace, and the people at the NFI (monitoring the event on a giant-screen
% TV labelled `Mission Control') are equally touched.
