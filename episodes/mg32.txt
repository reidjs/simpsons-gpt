After Bart throws the ball at Homer, it magically reappears in the corner
of the room.  (Can you say, ``recycled animation''?)

> Assorted comments and observations
===============================================================================
Brian Howard {bh} gives the timing for this short as 1:10, whereas the
syndication package contains only 1:02 of animation.

Brian Howard reports that the final line is Marge saying, ``Isn't that sweet.''
Maybe this is something they changed at the last minute.

% Marge sits on the couch knitting, while Homer stands by the door.

H: I've had it up to here with those kids!
M: Calm down, dear.
H: They're driving me out of my mind!  That's why I bought this book on
   hypmotism. [sic] [shows book]
M: What?
H: I'll hypmotize 'em.  Maybe then we can get some peace and quiet
   around here!
M: I don't know, Homer.  The kids get kind of rambunctious sometimes,
   but I think that's norm{al.}
H: {A little} rambunctious?  They're bouncin' off the walls!

% Homer opens the door, and we peer inside.  As he described, Bart and
% Lisa are indeed bouncing off the walls.  (Maggie just sits on the floor.)
% Lisa sings, ``La-la-la-la-la'' while Bart goes ``Blubdublubdublub''.
% Homer shuts the door.

M: I'll hold 'em, you hypnotize 'em.

M: Look, children!  We have a treat for you!
H: You're going to get hypmotized!

% The watch dangles in front of the kids, who watch it swing back and forth.

M: Now look at the watch.
H: You're getting sleepy.  Sleeeeeepy.
M: Sleepy.
