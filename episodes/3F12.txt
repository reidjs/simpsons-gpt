=======================================================================

    Bart inadverently alerts the IRS to tax fraud by Krusty the

    government sells his possessions.  Bob Newhart has a cameo.

> Opening Sequence
=======================================================================

>> COUCH SCENE

     A ringing sound is heard as the couch spits up a picture of
     OFF in sitting position like a FAX machine, which then slides
     under the couch.

> Animation, Continuity, and other Goofs
=======================================================================

- The animation in the first minutes of Act I was a bit off.

= Some envelopes that were on the executor's desk disappears in
  the shot of Homer saying there's no such thing as ghosts.  {jl}

c When the family arrive at the haunted house, CC reads "(shutter
  banging)" but no sound is heard ('cept for the lightning)

  be against it now?  {jh}

= The Tacomat is farther away in the first shot than it is in the
  second.  {jl}

= There are more people in the bank in the interior establishing shot
  than anyplace else.  {jl}

= There are 5 or 6 people in line in the bank, but Marge and the kids
  go straight at a counter.  {fb}

= Maggie isn't in the car when the family drives away from the bank.
  {jl}

* The "time to order new checks" blank should be the last stub, not
  the first.  {hl}

c After Bart looks at his flip check book, he says "Cool!", but CC
  credits the line to Lisa.

* The one-cent check to Lisa is supposed to be written out as "Only One
  Cent", not "One Cent and No/100 Cents".  {ddg}

  returned to him was a 75-cent check dated January 6. {jh}

+ Apu doesn't accept checks (see 3F03).

+ The digits in Bart's checks begin as normal digits, but later appear
  as the square kind of digits normally on the bottom of checks.  {ddg}

+ All of Bart's checks are numbered "001" in the book.  {ddg}

+ All the checks are written out January 5th or 6th of 1996, except
  for the check written to Krusty which is dated 1995.  {wtc}

= The pen at the teller's desk is gone when he calls New York.  {jl}

+ There's a photo of Krusty at Bart's birthday party, but Krusty says
  in 2F12 that he doesn't do birthday parties.  {ddg}

- The IRS Plaza is sloppily drawn.  {jl}

* Doesn't Bart get 10% of the money the IRS got from Krusty?  {ddg}

+ Didn't Marge get over her gambling problem in 1F08, 2 years ago, not
  one?  {jm}

* Schedule B is for reporting dividends and interest; a gambling loss
  would be listed on Schedule A, and (a) no more than any gambling
  winnings listed on the 1040 and (b) only those losses you can prove.
  {ddg}

= When Krusty is walking to his mansion, no sign of it is seen in the
  background; in the next shot, the mansion is placed in such a way
  that we should have seen it in the last shot.  {jl}

+ Krusty changes houses yet again. {mar}

- Moe is sloppily drawn in the far shot.  {jl}

= Selma has her arms to her sides except in close-up shots where her
  arms are crossed.  {jl}

* It would be impossible to get the cartons of pornography on the
  stand so quickly.  {jl}

  a rather long while to reach the funeral.  {jl}

= In one shot at the funeral, Mayor Quimby looks black.

* There can't be a USA Krusty stamp until the tenth anniversary of his
  death, unless he's elected President.  {ddg}

= Bart is wearing a black armband when he sees Krusty for the first
  time after his death, but when Bart runs home it's gone.  {mar}

+ Krusty's pacemaker scar, birthmark, and superfluous nipple
  disappeared in some episodes, most notably 9F19; now they are seen
  again.  {jh}

+ The cattle-skull birthmark and superfluous nipple disappear in some
  scenes.  {jh}

+ Wouldn't _somebody_ notice Krusty bailing out of the plane?  And
  wouldn't anybody be suspicious that there was no body?  Of course,
  this is Springfield... {mar}

= The way we see the crash, the shoes fall out of the plane right after
  the crash, but they took some time to fall in the real crash.

= A lot of unusual camera angles are employed in the Rory Bellows/
  Krusty scene that make it impossible for the boat to leave the slip
  the way it did.  {jl}

+ Krusty's illiteracy (originally mentioned in 7G12) is mentioned
  again, but in other episodes (e.g. 9F08 and 1F16) he reads.  {jh}

+ Krusty wore clown makeup in the past (cf. 7G12), but in 9F09 he said
  his pale skin "ain't makeup."  {jh}

=======================================================================
> Comments and other observations
=======================================================================

>> Tax Evasion Through Creative Accounting

Benjamin Robinson says, "When you store some of your wealth in overseas
    accounts, you are still supposed to report it to the IRS so they
    can assess taxes on it.  Most countries will cooperate with the tax
    man when he asks about your overseas assets, so you theoretically
    can't get away with saying you have no money stashed away in some
    foreign land.  Some nations, like the Cayman Islands, are notorious
    for keeping your little secret.  As a result, they've become havens
    for money launderers, tax cheats, and the like.  I don't recommend
    trying this at home; people have been caught at it, and payback's a
    bitch."

>> Celebrities in the Afterlife

Benjamin Robinson tells us about the infamous celebrities Homer wants
    to join.
    
    "John Dillinger was a notorious bank robber during the Depression.
    Federal agents ambushed him in front of a movie theater and shot
    enough holes in him to turn him into a colander."

    "Ty Cobb was an early baseball player, recently immortalized in the
    movie, `Cobb'.  He was such an ornery cuss that he makes Monty
    Burns look like a pussycat in comparison."

    "Josef Stalin was the dictatorial ruler of the Soviet Union from
    the '30's until his death in 1953.  The title of `World's Most Evil
    Ruler' is usually a tossup between him and Hitler."

He adds, "If these people are in Heaven, I'm booking passage for Hell."

>> Andre the Giant, We Hardly Knew Ye

Mark Richey says Andre Giant is "a former pro wrestler.  He became
    an actor and co-starred in `The Princess Bride'.  He died about
    five years ago."

>> Sitting Shivah

Benjamin Robinson says, "Shivah is a Jewish mourning ritual, sort of
    like a wake, observed by the family of the recently departed.
    Among other things, the family covers all the mirrors in the house
    (mirrors are a sign of vanity), avoids pleasurable activities, and
    basically drops out of civilization for a while.  Relatives and
    friends come over to comfort the surviving family members.  Shivah
    lasts seven days; the name comes from the Hebrew word for `seven.'"

>> Uhm, uh, heh, Bob, uh, that is, uhm, Newhart

Jason Hancock remarks, "Interesting choice for the producers to choose
    Bob Newhart for a guest voice in an episode involving a bank.  For
    the last couple of years Newhart has been done commercials for
    Norwest Banks, a Midwestern bank chain.  In the ads he answers the
    phone, "Hello, Norwest?" and stutters as he tries to explain what
    Norwest offers to customers."  Also, Marcia Wallace, who voices
    regularly as Ms. Krabappel, was on "The Bob Newhart Show".
    Unfortunately, she wasn't in this episode.

>> The number on the wreaths (or Let's Bug the Producers)

Dave Hall says, "For those who were wondering about the `369-3084'
    number on one of the wreaths at Krusty's funeral, it's Bill 
    Oakley's office phone number."  What area code, though?  ... ;-)

>> "Mad About You", aka The Devil's Show

"Mad About You" is an NBC television show that competes with "The
    Simpsons" for the 8:00 timeslot, and IMHO is inferior.  Then again,
    everything is inferior to "The Simpsons", with the possible
    exception of "Rugrats"... nahh.

>> Dr. Who?

Veronica Marquez reports, "`Dr. Who' is a British program about a
    man who travels through time.  Fox made it into a made-for-TV
    movie that aired May 14."

> Reviews
=======================================================================

Dale G. Abersold - It started out well and ended well, but had a
    terrible second act.  Bob Newhart's inspired cameo was a highlight,
    but I was hoping for a Bob Newhart/Marcia Wallace reunion.  I'm
    sure some will hate this episode, but I give it a solid B.

Frederic Briere - I spent half an hour staring at the tube, wondering
    what was wrong with the show -- or with me -- and the feeling
    didn't go away on successive watchings of what seems like a Krusty
    Gets Busted rerun. The plot felt as weak as Radioactive Man
    (which, ironically, aired on the same night), without any good
    satire. A few scenes, like Chalmers and Skinner, or seeing Hans
    again, saved it from a total disaster; nontheless, it is still
    painful to watch.  Grade: D

Chris Courtois - "Bart the Fink" was another hit-and-miss episode.
    There was a goldmine of clever details and touches for the Freeze
    Frame/DYN crowd, a so-so but somewhat predictable story for the
    rest of us, and what may be the most pointless and lame celebrity
    cameo in the show's history.  I guess it all balances out to a
    C/C-.

Rick Diamant - Now that's more like it!  Great plot that they stuck 
    with, characters stayed in character, lots of LOL funny lines,
    scenes, signs, and DYN's.  The only flaw was one of the all-time
    worst cameos, by Bob Newhart.  Because of that, I have to downgrade
    to an A-, but only barely.
 
Don Del Grande - B-minus - not much of an opening, not much of a story,
    and not much of an ending.  Been there, done that.  And I doubt
    that I was the only person who saw the "Krusty fakes his death"
    coming...

Jason Hancock - Not a bad episode -- better than the last two, but
    still not on par with "Team Homer."  I liked Troy McClure's
    performance at the funeral, the auction scene, and Milhouse's
    scaring the girls with Krusty's autograph. However, the Bob Newhart
    appearance was lame.  Grade:  B.

Jose Lafaurie - You call that an episode?  It should have been at least
    a two parter because it had a very abrupt ending, and a not-so-hot
    plot.  So far what I've seen from the writers is krap for Krusty
    and mush for Marge.  They need to understand that these characters
    are pretty inflexible.  D-

Haynes Lee - A generally good show because Krusty carried it.  However
    the opening scenes should have been in a Treehouse of Horror
    episode (what happened to Hutz?!!) and Bob Newhart guest appearance
    was even more lame than Mel Brooks'.  GRADE: B-

Adam Lipkin - Well, all in all not a bad episode. The beginning was a 
    little misleading in that it really gave no clue as to where this
    was going (a haunted house? What the hell does that have to do with
    Krusty?)  Solid plot, good laughs. B+.

John Martin - Pretty good all around.  Handsome Pete was hilarious!
    ("Arr!  Not a quarter!")  IRS Burger, the Haunted House, Taco Hut,
    and Bart's checks ("Oh the Humanity") were also good.  I'm still
    laughing over Handsome Pete!  A-/B+

Todd Morrell - When you are watching a good episode of the Simpson's,
    not only do you laugh aloud, but there is a flow to the episode.
    Last night, neither of these two sentiments were apparent.  The
    storyline was choppy and there were many incoherencies.  It just
    was a very poor episode.  Definitely one of the ten worst I have
    ever seen.  It is like they did a first draft and went with it 
    without refining the story.  I would give it a C, but C is average
    and this episode did not come close to average. But since I can't
    give a Simpsons episode an F, I'll give it a D.  Maybe next week's
    will be better.

John Murray - Grade: A-  Finally the episode that is half decent.
    After a very mediocre season it is nice to see an episode with some
    good laughs that actually fit in and work well with the plot.  The
    whole haunted house thing was a great return to the unexpected
    wackiness or lack thereof that makes the Simpsons great.  Even
    though this episode didn't have a well defined separate sub-plot,.
    a staple of great Simpsons episodes, this episode still was great
    Let's all hope the trend of better episodes continues.

Mark Richey - Oh, good.  Just when I thought that the show was running
    out of steam, they come up with a good episode.  While not an all
    time classic, the first act was hilarious.  However, Act III, with
    Bart and Lisa's trackdown of Krusty saggd a little.  However, it
    was far better than the past few weeks.  Grade: B

Benjamin Robinson - An excellent chapter in the strange story of Krusty
    and Bart's relationship.  Deft references to previous episodes
    highlight a full-throttle adventure.  A good example of making
    things unusual enough to be interesting, but not so strange as to
    defy belief. (A)

Dan Ryazansky - Not the best of episodes, but a very solid one. The IRS
    gags were pretty good, and so was Handsome Pete who dances for
    nickels. For a season 7 episode, it is way above average. But for
    regular Simpsons, it is just that.  B-.

Michael Stein - Better than last week's episode, and some of the plot
    elements are much more reminiscent of classic Simpsons episodes
    than others. The ending almost dragged on too long, thus causing
    Krusty to come up with an abrupt "solution" to his problem and join
    Bart and Lisa for another typical Hollywood-style happy ending. To
    paraphrase Bart's so-called "book report" on "Treasure Island", on
    a scale of 1 to 10, I'll give this ep. a 5 - it's somewhere in-
    between "good" Simpsons and "mediocre" Simpsons.

Christine Tiplady - I did not like this episode one bit.  The Country
    Club episode was much better.  "Bart the Fink" was not funny, and
    was just plain annoying.  Krusty's voice was grating on me by the
    end.  It's always a bad episode when the featured character's voice
    starts grating on me towards the end and I can't help dreading
    every time he opens his mouth.  I thought it actually approached
    painful.  [Give a letter grade, next time, though, 'kay?  --ed]

Yours Truly - I hated this one for the same reason I hate Sideshow Bob
    episodes: I don't find Bart and Lisa as a detective agency very
    funny.  (But that's just part of why I hate SSB.)  I didn't peep in
    Act One, I laughed once in Act Two, and by the end of the show I
    felt like I would have rather taken the advice of the bus and
    watched "Mad About You" instead.  Just kidding.  Still, this one
    was too terrible to be giving anybody ideas.  My Grade: D+

AVERAGE GRADE: C/C+ (2.39)

% Milhouse thinks it's a good plan, but it won't impress girls.  He
% demonstrates by baring his belly to a bunch of girls, who are

% A month later, Bart gets Lisa's signature, Apu's (?), and Jimbo's
% (whose real name is Corky).  But Krusty's stamped his check with
% a Cayman Islands Off-Shore Holding Corporation stamp.  Bart is
% enraged, and takes it back to the bank so that they can make him sign

Krusty: WHO'S JOKING?!  Oh, I don't understand what you're saying,

-- Boo yourself, "Bart the Fink"

 Man 2: It simply means we'll be taking a small portion of your salary

        I got to ride the bus like a schnook.
        I got to live in an apartment like an idiot!

        a healthy brown, and most important, I learned that I don't
        need money to be happy.  All that high living just distracted
        me from my true calling in life: salvaging sunken barges for
        scrap iron.  Sorry, kids, there's nothing left for me on dry
        land anymore.
  Bart: But, Krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you to
        brighten up their afternoon.  Are you gonna turn your back on
        them?
Krusty: Yes!
-- Good answer, "Bart the Fink"

% Krusty sails off, but Bart and Lisa follow him, saying a bunch of
% stuff to make him covet his old life.  When he sails away, Bart and
% Lisa call after him.

         [Krusty sails out of view]
  Lisa: What about the great feeling you get from knowing you're better
        than regular people?
  Bart: What about being an illiterate clown who's still more respected
        than all the educators in the country put together!
         [Krusty throws down his anchor]
Krusty: Yeah!  I'm not gonna let those guys hog all the respect while
        I'm out here in this stinking tub.
         [dives into the water and swims to shore]
        That's just what those eggheads want!  Well, forget it
        poindexter, 'cause Krusty's back in town!
   B+L: Yay!
-- Forget those PC thugs, "Bart the Fink"

% Krusty shakes off his yellow paint, fake beard, and fake nose (looks
% like his real nose is red), then puffs back out his hair.  He, Bart,
% and Lisa walk off together.

  Bart: So, Krusty, what are you gonna do about your tax problems?
Krusty: Don't sweat it.  The life of Rory B. Bellows is insured for a
        surprisingly large amount.
         [far off, Rory's boathouse blows up]
 B+L+K: [laugh]
-- Rory B. Bellows: We Are Richer For Having Lost Him, "Bart the Fink"

% Bart and Lisa laugh while the credits show up, and Krusty lets slip
% one of his goofy laughs.

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21'19"]
