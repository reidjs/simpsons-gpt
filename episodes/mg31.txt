Brian Howard {bh} gives the timing for this short as 1:09, whereas the
syndication package contains only 1:06 of animation.

Marge's face does the Bart Twitch twice, once when she says ``disappointed''
and again when she says, ``No, no, no.''

> Quotes and scene summary
===============================================================================
% B = Bart, L = Lisa, G = security guard, O = store owner, M = Marge, H = Homer
%
% Bart, Maggie and Lisa stand in front of a candy stand inside a convenience
% store.

B: I've gotta have those candy bars!
L: But Bart, we don't have any money.
B: There's <gotta> be a way!
L: You better not be thinking of stealing those candy bars...
B: That's it!
L: Better not, Bart.

% Meanwhile, Bart stuffs candy bars into his pants as he mischievously
% raises his eyebrows.

B: So long, suckers!

% Bart exits.  Then soon thereafter returns, carried by the back of his shirt
% by the store security guard.

B: They caught me.

% Bart is placed in the security office, his ill-gotten gains arrayed on
% the desk before him.

G: You just sit right there and think about your crime, you dirty
   little shoplifter-thief.

% The guard leaves.

B: [false fear]  Yes, sir!  [sticks out his tongue]

% Back in the store, the guard chats with the store owner.  Maggie and
% Lisa hide behind the candy stand, their eyes (and cute noses) peeking
% over the counter.

O: Is he scared?
G: I think I got that kid so scared he can't even see straight.
O: Good.  Frighten him some more while I call his parents.
L: [quietly]  Poor Bart...

% The guard returns to the office.

G: Well, boy.  Looks like the jig is... Gasp!

% Bart sits at the desk, his hands and mouth smeared in chocolate.  The
% evidence on the desk is gone.

B: I know my rights!  You can't hold me if you ain't got no evidence, copper!

% Bart sees his face in the mirror and swallows hard.

B: Uh, is it too late to make a full confession?

% {Homer and Marge come to take them home.}
%
% In the car.  Homer drives.

M: Your father and I are <very> disappointed in you, Bart.

% Lisa smiles.

B: Gee, I hadn't noticed.
H: Bart!
M: What have you learned from this experience, Bart?
B: Well, Mom, I might have been caught and had a few bad moments there, but I
   gotta admit, the chocolate was delish.
M: No, no, no, Bart.  The lesson is, ultimately, crime hurts the criminal.
B: That's not true, Mom.  I got a free ride home, didn't I?

% The car screeches to a halt.  We hear Bart yell ``Ungh!'' followed by
% a thud.  The car speeds off.  Bart is left standing by the side of the
% road.
