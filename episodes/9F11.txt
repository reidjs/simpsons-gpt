=======================================================================
> Animation, Continuity, and other Goofs
=======================================================================

- The interviewer points his microphone at Lance before he finishes his
  own sentence.  {jt}

* The first scene of Lance in the Washing Machine shows people clinging
  onto arm bars, yet Lance is incapable of doing this.  {dh}

= The kids supposedly ran off to start the car for Homer, yet in the
  next scene Homer and the kids are seen getting dressed in Bart's
  bedroom.  {dh}

= In the beginning, Bart and Lisa <do> wear their shoes.  But in the
  next scene where they are in Bart's room, they are seen putting them
  on.  {jt}

+ Establishing shot of the car ride doesn't show Maggie.  {dh}

+ The family's funeral attire doesn't match the ones worn in [MG14]

+ In MG14, Homer declared that the children could never attend another
  funeral.

= Bart and Lisa disappeared in the car after they picked up Patty and
  Selma.

- As usual, Patty and Marge's earrings keep on hanging on thin air.

+ Homer hugging the Gruesome Twosome was a little out of character for
  him.  {jt}

* Also, didn't he hear the insults during the hug?  {jt}

+ Homer is right-handed in this episode.

= The remote control only appeared in Homer's hand when he needed it.

- The grandfather clock's pedestal isn't moving, so how can it be
  ticking?

~ It shouldn't take that long to read "The Road Not Taken".

~ If you have read "The Road Not Taken", you know that Aunt Gladys
  totally screwed the mood of the last line.

* How did Homer know when to press Play again in the will?

* If Aunt Gladys knew she was going to die lonely, why didn't she
  just tell Patty and Selma to rasie a family before she died rather
  than put it in the will?  {dh}

= Selma's used cigarette appeared out of nowhere.

+ The bag boy had to wear orange, yet the cashier didn't.  {dh}

= The `Vision testing' sign appears out of thin air.  {dh}

= Hans' driver's license did not say that he was unmarried, even when
  Selma said so.  (See "Freeze-frame" section.)  {jt}

- Marge points at the sandwich well before she mentions the mayonnaise
  is turning.

= The wastebasket disappears.

+ The trash cans where Marge throws Homer's sandwich aren't usually
  there (in the master bedroom next to the bed and on the sidewalk
  near the driveway).  {jt}

+ Where exactly is Maggie through all this? She isn't seen in Duff
  Gardens or at home.

= Selma and the kids seem to move instantly to the front of the line
  for entering the park.

= Selma's purse disappeared after the `See the world through the eyes
  of a drunk' gag.  {dh}

= Selma and the kids enter the line for the Little Land of Duff, but
  the camera pan shows that it's the Complaints line

- When Bart stares at the Little Land of Duff ride, they seem to be in
  Spain a long time.

* The robots in the Little Land of Duff are from multiple continents,
  so they're not visiting any "continents."

= Lisa's skin turns from pale to yellow in both the Electric Parade and
  the closing scenes.

* The cart couldn't go straight into a loop in "The Barrel Roll"
  without picking up speed.

* Bumper cars can't run if they're not connected to the electrical
  ceiling.

= The hands that the "doctor" put the pills into look like Lisa's, but
  in the next scene they're Selma's.

+ Homer holds Selma's hands at the end. !?!?!?  {jl}

+ In the vocal performance in the credits, the title of the song is
  shown incorrectly.  (It should be: You Make Me Feel (Like A Natural
  Woman)

>> "Yentl" (or, a song with some movie in it)

Jos‚ Lafaurie tells us: "`Yentl' is a 1983 "film with music". Barbra 
    Streissand starred, produced, and co-wrote the film.  Other stars 
    include Mandy Patinkin, and Amy Irving.  Streissand plays 
    Yentl, a young woman who has to disguise herself as a man to 
    attend a school of higher learning.  (She could easily pass for
    a man. B-)  Homer and Marge seem to be watching the scene when 
    Avigdor (Patinkin) discovers that Yentl is a woman."

Also, the movie was based on a book, "Yentl the Yeshiva Boy", which
    explains Homer's comment "That Yentl put the `she' in `yeshiva'."

>> Bart playing with the stiff

Juha Terho declares this the most tasteless gag in the fourth season.
    "Reminds me of the Monty Python skit, `if you don't like your dead
    mother, we can dig a grave where you can throw up after you've
    eaten her', but that was <meant> to be offensive.

    "Note that in MG14, Bart felt disgusted at the sight of a dead
    body. Perhaps he's seen more movies since then and become
    desensitized to it."

>> Bottle rockets and Selma's vision

Juha Terho ponders, "When Selma's taste and smell were destroyed by
    the bottle rocket (8F20, see also "References to previous
    episodes" section in this episode), perhaps she lost also the
    vision from her other eye?  With a 3-D vision (two eyes), anyone
    should have realized right away that the mail-order husband was
    a flat cardboard cutout.  (Still, Selma extinguishing her cigarette
    on her tongue was hilarious.)"

>> Duff Beer Hall of Presidents

Quite sophisticated robots in there.  Lincoln's movements and perfect
     lip sync would be very difficult to actually carry out.  And
     Washington seemed to have a life of its own.

>> Cartoon physics

Juha Terho observes, "The same thing that happened in 9F01 was seen
    also in here: Bart hanging from the fast-going roller coaster cf.
    Otto hanging from the fire truck.  As we know, that is be
    impossible if the roller coaster or fire truck does not accelerate-
    and neither did.

    "Of course, this is not a goof, because The Simpsons is a cartoon.
    A similiar thing is the bumper cars moving with no source of
    energy."

I also noticed that the roller coaster cannot go into a loop without
    accelerating.  Maybe the Simpsons' world isn't so "real" as we
    imagined it to be.

>> Homer off-character

Jose Lafaurie says, "Homer seemed a little bit off-character in this
    episode, which is because he doesn't show the total despisement of
    his sisters-in-law than he usually does.  He hugs Patty and Selma,
    and at the end he holds Selma's hand in sympathy.  I just stood
    there and scratched my head."

>> A Damn Farce of a Light Show

    Yours truly mentions that the scene where Lisa can "see the music"
    parodies Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade. Anyone who's
    been to Disneyland knows that exhausting, irritating music and the
    flashing floats can really get on your nerves... but parents seem
    to like to watch them. D'oh!

>> The song girls sing after great sex all the time on TV

    "You Make Me Feel (Like A Natural Woman)" was originally sung by
    Aretha Franklin for Atlantic Records in 1967.  It was co-written
    by Carole King, who, as Kevin Bowman tells me, later performed
    the song.

>> Special Guest Voice in this Episode

Phil Hartman is a regular guest voice.  But he voices more characters
    than in other episodes (five characters), the only other episode
    coming close to this is "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment"
    where Hartman played most of the characters on cable TV.

>> Life Imitates Art

Benjamin Robinson tells us "Recently, a group of Florida high-schoolers
    was arrested during a school trip to Busch Gardens, Tampa, for 
    bringing some LSD along to the park.  (Which, I suppose, brings a 
    new meaning to "school trip.")  The incident happened shortly after 
    "Selma's Choice" hit the syndication circuit.  Coincidence?  Well, 
    yeah, probably.  But an INTERESTING coincidence, nevertheless."

> Reviews
=======================================================================

Benjamin Robinson - I thoroughly enjoyed "Selma's Choice" when it first
    aired, and it's still one of my favorites today.  The individual 
    sub-stories -- Gladys' funeral, Selma's attempts to become a 
    mother, and the trip to Duff Gardens -- are interesting, and tie
    together into a nicely cohesive whole.  I give this one a solid A.

Juha Terho:
	Technically one of the best episodes in a long time.  The
	backgrounds were also very detailed.  Just look at the audience
	in the very beginning or Gladys' chair in the video will.  The
	3-D sequence and Homer's fast-forward were expertly done.  So
	was the plot.  Duff Gardens connects very well to the main
	story concerning Selma.  And Jub Jub surprises us by returning
	at the end.  The only blunder was the ending, which was perhaps
	a little too abrupt.  Unlike most of the fourth season episodes,
	all jokes were related to the plot.

	Great visual gags, witty conversation, billions of one-liners,
	the most hilarious scene in the history of the series (Selma's
	date with Hans and her fantasy about their future)...  A
	full-packed episode.

	Springfield Sperm Bank and "Forgot my hat" were also very
	close seconds!  This is a work of a genius mind.
	"Hurrahhh...!"

	One of my all-time favorites, and definitely the best episode
	of the fourth season.  A.

Jose Lafaurie - This was a great episode.  I thoroughly enjoyed the way
    that Lisa frolicked around Duff Gardens.  And George Washington
    goes mad is my favorite flick.  GRADE: A+

Yours Truly - I loved "Selma's Choice". Selma makes a rebound off of
   the lackluster "Black Widower" and gets to interact more with OFF.
   _EXCELLENT_ rip of the beer-owned theme parks and Disneyland. And
   great Homer lines are the icing on the cake. Overall: A

% A motorcycle and flaming buses, with a crowd around it.  The

% leaps over all the flame, then lands on another ramp. The camera 
% follows the cycle as he waves but it moves too far when he crashes 
% into a wall.  It moves back to see the wreckage. An announcer speaks.

Announcer: Hey, Lance Murdock, you just jumped sixteen blazing school

    Lance: [groaning] I'm going to... Duff... Gardens!
-- Disneyland would be my second choice, "Selma's Choice"

% Announcer continues, "Duff Gardens, home of the Whiplash!" as a

% and teeters over, screaming.

% Now Murdock is in a centrifuge with water at the bottom, strapped to

I can see the music!

% Bart's on a high-speed roller coaster, just making the required
% height.  He's measured by a worker, who lets him on. But Bart had
% candied apples on his feet.  The strap that comes down on him is
% barely protective as the released car flies off, leaving Bart hanging
% on for dear life by the bar.  After a slight bureaucratic hesitation,

% downward, and Selma and Surly watch from below.

Selma: Surly, can't you do something.
Surly: Ey, Surly only looks out for one guy -- Surly.
Selma: Hm, sorry, Surly.
Surly: Shut up!
-- Don't mess with Surly, "Selma's Choice"

% In the security office, Selma tries to talk things over with the

Don't blame these kids, it's not their fault. I think their father's
missing a chromosome.

 Selma: Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: Oh, I'm not a doctor.
-- But I play one on TV!, "Selma's Choice"

% At the Simpsons household, Marge is cooking beans when lo and behold,
% mighty Homercles appears!

Homercles: Come to Homercles!
    Marge: [laughs] I can't! The beans will burn!
Homercles: Homercles cares not for beans!
	    [lifts up Marge on her shoulder]
-- Wow, he's in for some lovin', "Selma's Choice"

% They walk into Selma and the kids returning from Duff Gardens. Marge
% looks embarrassed.

Homer: Hi, kids, how was Duff Gardens?
 Lisa: Can't talk, coming down. [takes some pills]
-- Lisa under psychedelia, "Selma's Choice"

Selma: How do you do it, Homer?
Homer: You take an ordinary bedsheet, fold it around like th--
Selma: No, I mean raising kids! I just couldn't cut it today. All I
       wanted was a little version of me I could hold in my arms.
-- Then hold a snake, "Selma's Choice"

% Back in her apartment, Selma hold Jub-Jub in her arms, while Patty

Selma: Oh, Jub-Jub.
