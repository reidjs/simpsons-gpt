> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [From "TV Guide"] THE PARENT RAP.  Jane Kaczmarek lends her voice to a role
   with similarities to her Lois character from Malcom in the Middle in the
   13th-season opener.

   It begins with Bart and Milhouse accidentally stealing a police car.
   Expecting an easy judge, Bart is instead faced with Judge Constance Harm
   (Kaczmarek), a stern, no-nonsense arbiter. Noting Homer's contribution to
   the incident and sensing that Bart is "crying out for adult supervision."
   Her Honor orders the young troublemaker to be tethered to his father. The
   plan can't help but bring the pair closer to each other, but their new ling
   interferes with the relationship between Homer and Marge, who literally
   cuts the cord, landing her in Harm's way as well.  {af}

Couch:          The Simpsons stand on the deck of a sailboat.  It's a very
                simply-drawn sailboat, like the one in the picture hanging
                above their living-room couch.  The family members all jump in
                the water.  Surprise!  The boat *is* the one on the living-
                room wall.  The family makes a safe, if wet, landing on the
                couch, and Homer picks up the TV remote.

c  Audio: You damn dirty ape!  Captioning: Drop the gun, Johnny.  {tpl}

*  The police car's engine was running at one point, yet Bart never started
   it.  It also managed to switch from coasting backwards to coasting
   forwards.  {ddg}

+  Since when is Judge Snyder a lenient judge? He sentenced Marge to 30 days
   in 9F20 for shoplifting, which is a much less then Bart did here.  {af}

=  Was there some sort of edit after Judge Harm's introduction?  It sounds as
   though Marge was cut off in mid-sentence.  {bjr}

*  Clinton was never actually convicted of any crimes, so he wouldn't have
   been sentenced to community service... and what sort of crime matches the
   penalty of having to deliver mail?  {bc2}

=  Bart's shoe changes color from blue to black after Homer loses it during
   his nightmare.  {mg}

   Captioning: The Heat's been on ever since that bad tricycle wreck.  {tpl}

*  How did Homer and Bart change clothes while they were tethered to one
   another?  [But see Gene Poole's rebuttal in the "Comments" section -- Ed.]

c  Audio: Don't use the bottle! That's what hobos do.  Captioning: Don't use
   the bottle! That's what animals do.  [Ted S adds, "IIRC, the line in the
   captioning was also used in the promo" -- Ed.]  {tpl}

=  When Marge is talking to the judge, she is wearing green triange earrings
   but when she and Homer leave the courtroom with their heads in stocks, the
   earrings are gone.  {mg}

+  Homer and Marge have been declared bad parents before.  {ddg}

*  For that matter, how were Homer and Marge able to change outfits while in
   the stocks?

c  Audio: Dr. Bonebreak just married Rumblina and they're already wailing at
   each other!  Captioning: Dr. Bonebreak just married Rumblina five seconds
   ago and they're already going at it!  {tpl}

+  When Homer's freeing Marge, his arms go all the way to the armpits through
   the hand holes. They could have washed the dishes much easier with full use
   of their arms.  {cl}

=  Homer puts up his side of the banner with two nails, but later shots show
   it is clearly hanging by one.  {bjr}

*  The newspaper has a picture of the boat sinking, but there didn't appear to
   be any photographers around when this happened.  ["My guess is Willy [took
   the picture]," says {bp} -- Ed.]

*  Why would a juvenile judge try Homer and Marge for sinking the houseboat?
   {ddg}

*  Wouldn't she [Judge Harm] be required to recuse herself from the case?  She
   did have a strong personal stake in the outcome.  {bjr}

*  As the Family hugs each other at the end, Homer's mouth opens for a split

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Brian Corvello:  This was one of the best series premiers I've seen in a long
   while. The only real bad part was that joke about the Bush daughters --
   that was uncalled for. Still, I always like it when members of the family
   get into legal trouble (heck, with the exception of Maggie, all of them
   have been arrested at least twice!). Also, the way the family coped (or
   tried to) with the tether and stocks was hilarious (although it was rather
   "cruel and unusual"). The "revelation" at the end that Constance was once a
   guy had me ROTF. I hope we see this character again.  (A-)

Don Del Grande:  Is it just me, or do the one-plotline shows just seem to be
   going through the motions?  There were plenty of chances for the old
   "slapstick" style humor, but they kept pounding that "cobras" gag into us
   instead, and the bit with Homer and Marge in stocks didn't really go
   anywhere either (well, except for Nelson and the extension cord).  And
   somebody explain what that scene atop the SNPP towers was supposed to be...
   (B)

Alex Foley:  The 13th Season starts out with a whimper as we begin the
   beginning of the end of the Mike Scully era. The Homer & Marge are bad
   parents issue has been tackled before, and better in episodes like "Home
   Sweet Home Diddily-Dum-Doodily".  Some decent jokes here, but nothing all
   that memorable here. A Run of the mill episode. Jane Kaczmarek  was good as
   Judge Harm however, which help kept the episode from being completely
   useless.  (C)

Joe Green:  Despite some good slapstick moments (Homer and Bart making each
   other slap themselves, Nelson using an extension cord as a whip) this show
   fell flat as a "message" episode, and was plagued by over-the-top
   "dysfunctional" gags (Milhouse and Bart almost killing the "promising young
   athletes", the "family court day" dialogue) and stuff that was just plain
   goofy (Homer and Bart sitting on the edge of the cooling tower, Judge
   Harm's use of the "miracle of fiberoptics"). A real letdown after last
   week's great Halloween show.  (C-)

Zan Hecht:  It sucked, and it wasn't even funny like past sucky episodes.  I
   rate it a D-.  If the premier is this bad, I don't have much hope for the
   rest of the season.  (D-)

Darrel Jones:  Maybe it's me, but the writers seem to have a knack of not
   using the strongest possible episodes to start the season. Still, I liked
   it, even if it lagged in bits and it wasn't as funny as many recent eps.
   7/10  (B+)

Chad Lehman:  George Meyer + The Simpsons = always funny. My favorite episode
   was penned by Mr. Meyer, as well as my second favorite (Homer the Heretic,
   Blood Feud). At first blush, there were quite a few laughs, but it seems
   like they were all slapstick and one-liners. An episode like this proves
   there is still good slapstick, and ways to write funny lines... but there
   wasn't much satire despite a huge opportunity to say something about our
   juvenile justice system. The conflict was interesting, and the plot was
   resolved. This is probably the best Mike Scully could do with the current
   formula of simple plot plus one-liners plus slapstick equals episode.  (B-)

Adam Leventhal:  This was a welcome sign that this season might mark an
   upswing. The episode was uneven, but it started very strong. The single
   plot line got a little tired, and the throw away jokes started to fall flat
   about midway through the episode. Strong cameos from Chief Wiggum and the
   42nd President gave this episode some life.  (B)

Yours Truly:  The new season is starting out a lot like the old one ended, and
   given that this is a holdover episode that makes some sense.  What's more
   puzzling is Marge's caring-to-callous (and back again) personality changes.
   There are some good jokes here -- I liked the school baseball scene -- but
   nothing to write home about.  Jane Kaczmarek is fine as hard-nosed Judge
   Harm.  On the whole, I judge the season to be off to a so-so start.  (B-)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B- (2.55)   Std Dev.: 0.8249   (10 reviews computed)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Musical References

Joe Green:  The first few bars of "Don't Fear the Reaper," by Blue Oyster
   Cult, are played over the closing credits.


Darrel Jones:  "Dang Me," by Roger Miller in 1964, plays on the radio at
   episode's end.


>> Meta-reference corner

Benjamin Robinson:  Bart's blackboard punishment, "Nobody reads these
   anymore," wryly suggests people aren't paying as close attention to the
   show as they used to.


>> No, wait, I thought *you* were Marty

Chad Lehman writes:  I'm glad they finally cleared up the seeming confusion
   over Bill and Marty's identities. I've not been confused; Shearer's
   character has always been Marty (the red-head), and Castellaneta's Bill
   (the bald one). Proof? In [9F07] when Homer's driving home in the snow,
   Bill (Castellaneta) says "you're dead weight, Marty". I know these guys
   have been confused by fans before; but Bill saying (on-screen) "You know
   what else is nice, Marty?" should set everyone straight on their
   identities.


>> You have the right to remain silent ...

Alan Hamilton:  Ernesto Miranda was arrested in 1966, accused of stealing $8.
   Under questioning, he confessed to this and to a rape that had been
   committed 11 days earlier.  He hadn't been advised of his rights before
   questioning.  He was convicted on both counts.


Benjamin Robinson writes:  Normally, that might have been the end of it, but
   his lawyer made a novel appeal.  Mr. Miranda was a poor man, with little
   knowledge of both English and the way the U.S. justice system worked.  At
   the start, he didn't even know he was entitled to a lawyer.  Miranda's
   lawyer argued that the cops should have advised his client of his rights
   after his arrest.  The case eventually went to the Supreme Court, where
   Miranda prevailed.  [But not for long.  Alan Hamilton writes, " He was
   tried again (with his confession excluded) and was again found guilty" --
   Ed.]

   The rights that you are supposed to be advised of popularly became known as
   the "Miranda rights."  Reading them to a suspect is "Mirandizing" him.
   Today, when the police arrest someone they have to read that little spiel
   that begins, "You have the right to remain silent."  (The punch in the
   belly is a recent addition, evidently.)  To be completely on the up-and-up,
   some policemen read the rights from a little card, rather than relying on
   memory.  As far as I know, nobody has anything as elaborate as Wiggum's
   teleprompter.


>> Marge, Meet Lois

Tom Restivo:  Jane Kaczmarek is no stranger to those who keep watching FOX
   after OFF -- she the twice Emmy-nominated actress who plays Lois, the
   mother with four Bart-like sons of her own (and a Homer for a hubby), on
   "Malcolm in the Middle". In real life, she's married to Bradley Whitford,
   who won an Emmy of his own as Josh Lyman on "The West Wing".

   (Side note: I wouldn't be surprised if Julie Kavner did a guest appearence
   on MitM as -- a juvenile judge.)


>> When "Eat my shorts" doesn't cut it

Ted S. writes:  I think it was Judge Judy's father who came up with [her]
   wacky catch-phrases.  Indeed, the "Don't spit on my cupcake and tell me
   it's frosting" line is a take-off on the title of Sheindlin's first book,
   "Don't Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It's Raining", a line she heard from her
   father. Sheindlin's second book was titled "Beauty Fades, Dumb is Forever".


>> Don't fear the reaper

Tom Restivo:  Blue Oyster Cult (The "O" is more properly "umlauted" [like
   this: Ö -- Ed.]) is a long-time heavy metal/monster band started in the
   late 60's and continuing into today. Their most famous hits include "Buring
   for You," "Godzilla", "Veteran of the Psychic Wars", "Joan Crawford", and,
   of course, "Don't Fear the Reaper".


Dean Humphries reminisces about Blue Oyster Cult:  The Blue Oyster Cult were
   an important part of my Wonder Years.

   This story goes wayyyyy back, back to a time that musicologists and
   mathamagicians refer to as the age of Heavy Metal.

   These were scary times - Heavy Metals's primodial age, where bands had
   names like T Rex and Steppenwolf, and people actualy bought Peter Frampton
   records.

   Moody Young Men were en vogue, they spoke an early form of grunt-like
   language that went on to become Billtedspeak.

   The BOC were college boys at SUNY, Stony Brook, Long Island, and most
   likely they knew they'd never last long enough to graduate.

   These guys had to help inspire Spinal Tap, at the end of their shows,
   they'd have everyone in the band (except the drummer) strap-on a guitar and
   play simultaneous leads (there were enough Bics lighted in the audience to
   make it day-light like).

   Their lead guitar player called himself Buck Dharma and had some sort of
   stun-guitar gimmick that I could never quite figure out what it was all
   about.

   This was a time that radio stations dj's were actually allowed to pick the
   music they played, one of the best free-form stations of this time was the
   local WLIR, and the BOC was at the right place at the right time (it's
   interesting to note that Andy Kaufman begin his career during the same
   time, and playing the same clubs).

   They had good songs with fantasic sounding titles, like:

   O.D.'d On Life Itself
   Before The Kiss (A Redcap)
   The Red And The Black
   Dominance And Submission
   Harvester Of Eyes
   Career Of Evil
   Baby Ice Dog
   Hot Rails To Hell
   Then Came The Last Days Of May
   Stairway To The Stars
   This Ain't The Summer Of Love
   Buck's Boogie

   Unfortunately, rarely was the music as imaginative as the titles.

   But back in the 70's, in one of those *you just had to be there* moments,
   the BOC were badass and they ROCKED.

   Then they had a hit and it all went to hell and a great episode of "Behind
   the Music" was born.

   Definitely one of Homer's fav bands during High School, I bet he even
   dropped acid at one of their concerts.


>> Tether fashion

How did Homer and Bart change clothes?  Gene Poole has a possible answer:  Let
   me ask you this:  how do hospital patients put on gowns with IV things into
   their arms connected to a rolling stand?

   Simple: snaps. lots of snaps.

   It can be done. Just because it doesn't make sense for them to have clothes
   like that is beside the point. Marge is just the kind of handywoman to
   spend an evening project on such a thing.


>> Presidential girls gone wild

Joe Klemm:  Many recent presidents have a family member who is known for
   getting themselves in trouble. For the current president, George W. Bush,
   that is in the form of his twin daughters. Both of them college students,
   the Bush twins have recently made news for getting caught drinking under
   the age.

% At the Promising Young Athletes picnic, a coach finishes up his 
% speech, saying, "... and that's why you young athletes are so

% Wiggum arrives on the scene, and takes the boys into custody.

All right, you two are under arrest for joyriding.  You have the right

-- Chief Wiggum, "The Parent Rap"

% Later, the Simpsons show up for their day in juvenile court.

Homer:	I love our court days.
Marge:	It's about the only thing we do as a family anymore.
Lisa:	[to bailiff] Hey, Karen.
Karen:	Hey, Lisa.

% Kirk Van Houten pleads his son's case.

Kirk:		Uh, your Honor, please don't send my son to juvie.  
		He's basically a good kid; he's just weak -- 
		morally, and in the upper body.
Milhouse:	Please let me slip through the cracks.
Snyder:		Well, you look like a good student, what with those 
		glasses, and I suppose boys will be boys.  [bangs 
		gavel] Case dismissed.
-- "The Parent Rap"

% Bart is the next to be called to the bench.  He prepares by putting 
% a large crucifix around his neck.  He and Judge Snyder exchange a 
% few pleasantries before Homer prompts them to move along.

Snyder:	[reads docket] Oh, my!  It looks like you were the 
	ringleader in this car theft -- and that's a felony!
	Bart:	Yes, sir.  [looks remorseful, and holds up his cross]
Snyder:	On the other hand, I was young once ...
	[cut to Homer]
Homer:	[aside to Marge] I'll bring the car around.
	[back to Snyder]
Snyder:	... and I suppose boys will be -- [an alarm rings, and 
	looks at his watch] Oh, ooh!  My vacation just started.  
	[packs up the little clown figurine he keeps on his desk]
Karen:	All rise for the honorable Judge Constance Harm.
	[a stern-looking judge walks in.  Ominously, her bench 
	decoration is a small gallows figurine]
Bart:	[gasps]
Marge:	Uh, oh.
Harm:	Silence in my courtroom!  [reads docket] Grand theft auto?
Bart:	It was an accident, ma'am.
Harm:	Don't spit on my cupcake and tell me it's frosting.
Bart:	[gulps]
Homer:	[to Marge, menacingly] What did she say about cupcakes?
Harm:	According to this, your father was driving you to school.  
	Then where was he when you stole the police car?
Homer:	Uh, your Honor, I was chasing the KBBL Party Penguin Prize 
	Patrol.
Harm:	You abandoned your son to win $40?
Homer:	And a Blue Oyster Cult medallion.  [holds it up and 
	admires it] Cool.
Harm:	And that was more important than keeping your son out of 
	trouble?
Homer:	Your honor, if may sing a little bit of, "Don't Fear the 
	Reaper," I think you'll agree --
Harm:	I'm familiar with BOC.  But you have got a boy here who is 
	crying out for adult supervision.
Homer:	I couldn't agree more.  Perhaps some sort of court-
	appointed babysitter or au pair.
Harm:	Sorry, bub, that crow won't caw.
Homer:	It won't?
Harm:	[bangs gavel] I hereby order you to be tethered to your 
	son.
Homer:	Tethered!?
Harm:	Tethered.  Report to room 5.
Homer:	Room 5!?
-- It's across from 101, "The Parent Rap"

% In room 5, a bailiff tethers Bart and Homer together.  The tether is 
% a white (presumably plastic) cord about four feet long, with a 
% handcuff at each end.  The bailiff finishes slapping the cuff on 
% Homer.

Bailiff:	There we go.  How's that?
Homer:		It's a little tight.  [indeed -- his hand's turning 
		purple]
Bailiff:	Sir, you are not a size four.
Homer:		I used to be.  [breaks down sobbing.  He runs from 
		the room, dragging Bart behind him]
-- "The Parent Rap"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  5:39]
%
% At home, Homer complains about his sentence.

Homer:		This punishment is so cruel.
Marge:		And unusual.
Bart:		Can that judge do this to us?
Lisa:		Creative sentencing is common these days.  That's 
		why Bill Clinton is our new mailman.
		[outside, Clinton tries to stuff some mail in the 
		Simpsons' mailbox]
Clinton:	Dang magazines.
-- "The Parent Rap"

% Marge tries to put a good spin on things, noting that being tethered 
% might be a good way for Homer and Bart to get to know each other 
% better.  (So long as Bart remembers to give his father his mood 
% medication.)  They start by racing each other to the kitchen, 
% accidentally clotheslining Lisa in the process.
%
% At school, Homer proves to be an even bigger disruption than Bart.

Edna:	Today, we're going to talk about predicates and predicate 
	nominatives.
Homer:	Bor-ring!
Edna:	Mr. Simpson, I'm trying to teach.
Homer:	Come on, these kids are never going to use that stuff.
Edna:	Mr. Simpson, will you please go back to sleep.
Homer:	Fine.  [curls up on the floor, and starts snoring.  Bart 
	sticks one of his sneakers in Homer's mouth to muffle the 
	noise]
Edna:	All right, now who can pick out the predicate in this 
	sentence?
Homer:	[begins screaming in his sleep]
Edna:	What's wrong with him now, Bart?
Bart:	Night terrors, ma'am.
Homer:	Aagh!  Cobras!
-- "The Parent Rap"

% A baseball game at school goes a little better.  Homer encourages 
% Bart to "Shut out everything but the sound of my criticism."  It 
% must have worked, because Bart connects with the ball.  He and Homer 
% run around the bases.  Soon, Homer runs out of steam, and collapses.  
% Bart's able to drag Homer along to home plate for his first home 
% run.  Homer tries to hug his son, but Bart's father looks a lot 
% worse for the wear after being dragged around the bases.  Homer 
% passes out at home plate and has another of his night terrors about 
% cobras.
%
% Later that night, Homer and Bart share dinner on the top of SNPP's 
% cooling towers.

Homer:	I thought I would hate working nights, but it's so 
	peaceful.  And there's no one here to squeal on me for 
	shootin' mice.
Bart:	Can I ask you something, Dad?
Homer:	Sure, boy.
Bart:	If towns keep getting bigger, will there always be enough 
	electricity?
Homer:	[chuckles] Aw, son, you know that's none of your business.
	Say, is that our house?  [points]
Bart:	Uh, I don't think our house has a steeple.
Homer:	[laughs] Oh, yeah.  I forget things sometimes.
-- "The Parent Rap"

% Homer and Bart walk home.  Just as Marge predicted, they are getting 
% to know one another better.  Bart says that the tether might have 
% some advantages.  The disadvantages make themselves clear when Homer 
% and Bart walk on either side of a lamppost.  The tether gets caught, 
% whipping Homer and Bart into each other.  Luckily, this happens 
% right outside Moe's tavern.  Homer and Bart go in.

Homer:	I hit my head, Moe.
Moe:	One beer, coming up.
	[Bart takes a seat on the stool next to Homer]
	Hey, hey, no kids in the bar!
Homer:	Since when?
Moe:	Aw, the heat's been on since them Bush girls were in here.
-- At least he wasn't hiding WMD, "The Parent Rap"

% No law says kids can't stand around in front of a bar, so Homer 
% stations his son just outside the door, while he sits on a barstool 
% just inside.

Bart:	I'm cold and scared.
Homer:	That's my little slugger.
Bart:	Come on, Dad, let's go.  [yanks his end of the tether, 
	which jerks Homer's hand, spilling his beer]
Homer:	Hey, knock it off!  These pants cost $600.
Moe:	Really?
Homer:	Yeah, they're Italian.
Moe:	[takes a shotgun from under the bar and points it at 
	Homer] All right, hand 'em over.
Homer:	Moe, what the ... ?  [begins taking his pants off]
Moe:	Yeah, I rob now.
-- Moe expands his horizons, "The Parent Rap"

% The family watches the evening news.

Kent:	There's a new judge in town with a hard-nosed approach to 
	juvenile crime:  Punish the parents.
Homer:	Yeah, it's about time.  [remembers the tether] Oh.
Harm:	Kids are running wild, Kent, and I blame Mr. and Mrs. 
	Never-spank.
Kent:	[looks to the camera] Uh, oh, we'll have to bleep their 
	names.
Harm:	You'll bleep nothing!  Parents, it's time to take control.  
	If you can't cope, you'll wear the rope!  [holds up a 
	tether and snaps it taught for emphasis]
Marge:	Well, you can tell she's never had kids.  Look how high 
	and firm her breasts are.
Lisa:	Granted, but you gotta admit constant supervision has been 
	good for Bart.  He might even make the honor roll, if Dad 
	can control his night terrors.
Homer:	Well, that's a pretty big "if," honey.
Bart:	[gets up] Come on, Dad, I gotta go to the bathroom.
Homer:	Oh, I just got comfortable.  Use the bottle.  [hands Bart 
	a glass jar]
Marge:	No, I don't want you going in a bottle.  That's what 
	hoboes do.
Bart:	Come on, Homer.
Homer:	No.
Bart:	Mom!
Marge:	Oh, jeez ... Homer, just take him to the bathroom.
Homer:	[gets up] Fine!  I don't even know why we have a bottle.  
	Somebody tell me!
-- "The Parent Rap"

% In bed, Homer and Marge start getting a little too romantic for 
% Bart's comfort.

Bart:	Would you mind?  I'm trying to do my homework.
Homer:	Uh, son, it's a little chilly.  Maybe you should wrap a 
	blanket around your head.  [begins doing so]
Marge:	Oh, Homey, no; we can't.
Homer:	Well, what's the -- what's the big deal?  He sees a 
	thousand times worse on that animal channel.
Marge:	I don't want him to see us ... expressing our love.
Homer:	Why not?  Kids are very visual these days.
-- "The Parent Rap"

% Bart tries to interrupt his parents' argument.  He yanks his hand 
% back suddenly, which causes Homer to slap himself with his tethered 
% hand.  Homer pulls the same trick on Bart, and soon the two are 
% fighting without actually coming into contact.  Marge gives up and 
% leaves the room.  Homer tries throttling Bart with the tether, but 
% the boy uses some of the cord to whip his Dad on the butt.
%
% Suddenly, Marge bursts into the room with a large knife.  Lunging at 
% Homer and Bart, she cuts the cord binding them together.  Severing 
% the tether must have triggered an alarm back at Judge Central, 
% however, because Judge Harm's image soon appears on the cut end of 
% Homer's tether.

Harm:	That's right -- it's me, Judge Harm, through the magic of 
	fiber optics.
Homer:	Hey, hey, hey.  H-How about that, huh, huh?
Harm:	Quiet, tubbsy.  You violated my order.
Homer:	But Constance, it only happened because --
Harm:	[interrupting] Hey, hey, if I want a cock and bull story, 
	I'll read Hemingway.
	[Bart and Homer stare at each other and shrug, mystified]
-- They're more the Faulkner type, "The Parent Rap"

% Marge and Homer each try to accept the blame for cutting the cord.  
% This just makes Harm so angry, that the cut end of the tether 
% actually catches on fire.
%
% The guilty parents must stand in the courtroom and bear Harm's 
% wrath.

Harm:	Well, I thought Dad was the problem, but apparently Mom is 
	no prize pig herself.  It's a miracle poor Bartholomew 
	isn't robbing banks and chasing sweet lady H.
Bart:	I'm a latchkey kid.
Lisa:	You are not!
Harm:	[bangs gavel] Quiet, little girl.  [to Homer and Marge] 
	You two need to wake up and smell the java.  And the first 
	step is to admit that you're bad parents.
Homer:	I admit it.
Marge:	Homer, no, we're not bad parents.
Harm:	Yes, you are.  Just say it!
Marge:	No, I won't.  And frankly, Judge, I think you're a bully.
Harm:	You do, huh?
Marge:	You're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, 
	you can't see how much I love my kids.
Homer:	Uh, your Honor, I'd like to be tried separately.
Marge:	I don't mean to be disrespectful, Judge Harm, but we are 
	not bad parents, and there isn't a tether in this world 
	with enough fiber optics to make me say we are.
Harm:	[contemplative] Hmm ...
	[cut to the courtroom doors.  They open, and Homer and 
	Marge walk out with large, ungainly wooden stocks clamped 
	around their necks and hands]
Marge:	She's such a butthole.
-- "The Parent Rap"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  12:56]
%
% Homer and Marge try to wash the dishes, but this is practically 
% impossible.  Lisa watches them for a little while, and then turns to 
% her brother, who is watching TV without a care in the world.

Lisa:		Do you think it's fair that you're always getting 
		into trouble, yet Mom and Dad are being punished?
Bart:		No, it's terrible.  [loudly slurps his soda]
Lisa:		Well, why don't you do something about it?
Bart:		After wrestling.
Announcer:	Ladies and Gentlemen, I don't believe what I am 
		seeing.  Dr. Bonebreak just married Rumbleina, and 
		they're already whaling on each other!  [on TV, a 
		wrestling couple attack each other with folding 
		chairs]
Lisa:		When are you going to start taking responsibility 
		for your actions?
Bart:		If I felt like it.
Lisa:		You're not even listening.
Bart:		I know you are, but what am I?
Lisa:		Ugh.  [walks off]
-- "The Parent Rap"

% The punishment continues.  Now, not only do Marge and Homer have to 
% wear the stocks, but also a set of clown pants and suspenders.  
% Chief Wiggum makes them stand by the side of the road so passers-by 
% can spank the couple from their cars.  Captain McAllister and Comic 
% Book Guy are the first to do so (and CBG says they're the "Worst 
% parents ever").  Nelson rides by on his bike and whips Homer and 
% Marge with an extension cord, something Wiggum disapproves of.
%
% That night, Homer tries to convince his wife to give in to Judge 
% Harm.

Homer:	You know, we could get out of these stupid things if you 
	just tell the judge you're a bad mother.  And you don't 
	even have to say, "bad."  It could be, "negligent," or, 
	"unfit," or, "drugged-up" ...
Marge:	I just can't do that, Homer.  It's a matter of principle, 
	and I need you to support me in this.  [Homer and Marge 
	look at each other]
Homer:	You're right.  It's time to stand up to that firm-breasted 
	judge.
-- Uh, not that I noticed, or anything, "The Parent Rap"

% Before they can do that, though, Homer and Marge have to shed the 
% stocks.  Homer and Marge try to use Ned's table saw to break the 
% lock.  Ned hears the noise and comes down to the garage, holding a 
% candle for light.  He startles Homer and causes him to shave a 
% lopsided curl into Marge's hair.

Ned:	You're using my table saw to violate a court order?
Homer:	Well, we tried all those other tools.  [gestures to a pile 
	of broken tools]
Ned:	Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to 
	be an accessory to some sort of shady doings.  And it does 
	raise a whole host of ethical questions ...
	[Homer uses the flame from Ned's candle to open the 
	stocks]
Homer:	Woo hoo!  [He and runs away, taking Marge]
-- "The Parent Rap"

% Free of the stocks, Homer and Marge embark on Operation Judge-Get-
% Back-At.  Dressed head to toe in black, they take the bus to Harm's 
% neighborhood and begin skulking to her home at 1 Oceanview Drive.  
% They get there (after being distracted by the milkman) only to find 
% no house at the address.

Homer:	This address must be wrong.
Marge:	No.  No, there it is.  [points to a houseboat docked 
	behind a chain-link fence]
Homer:	She lives in a houseboat!?  Wow, she's so cool!
Marge:	We hate her, Homer.
Homer:	I know, I know, fight the power.
-- "The Parent Rap"

% A police cruiser shows up and shines a spotlight on Homer and Marge 
% just as they start climbing the fence in front of the dock.  Marge 
% and Homer begin kissing, hoping to look like they're just a couple 
% out for a night of romance.

Lou:	Aw, ain't that sweet, Chief?
Wiggum:	It sure is, Lou.  Those two longshoremen found love.
-- Springfield:  The tolerance city, "The Parent Rap"

% The cops resume their patrol.  Homer and Marge scale the fence and 
% sneak up to the houseboat.

Homer:	[peering through a window] Look at her in there, washing 
	her body.
Marge:	Get away from that window, and help me with this banner.
	[Homer and Marge begin nailing up a banner]
Homer:	[giggles] I hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's 
	only one way to describe a nasty super-witch like her.  
	[unfurls his part of the banner, which reads "BI"]
	[soon, the banner is up, and we can see that the banner 
	reads, "BIG MEANIE"]
-- Actually, maybe there's two ways, "The Parent Rap"

% Homer and Marge try to retreat from the houseboat, but a seal blocks 
% their path.  It barks, alerting judge Harm to the Simpsons' 
% presence.  She steps onto the dock and starts to look for the 
% intruders.  As she closes in on Homer and Marge, Homer tries to 
% throw a cinderblock at her.  Fortunately for Judge Harm, he misses 
% her.  Unfortunately, the block hits her boat instead, quickly 
% sinking it.
%
% The next morning, Judge Harm studies the newspaper coverage of the 
% sinking, which mentions that one of Harm's quilts was ruined.

Harm:	Agh!  That quilt was made by my grandmother.
Homer:	So ... it cost you nothing.
Harm:	Shut up.  You two are not only horrible parents, you're 
	violent criminals, and I'm going to lock you up 'till 
	frogs do fractions.
	[Marge and Homer look apprehensive]
Bart:	[approaches the bench] Your Honor, may I say something?
Harm:	Well, it is highly unorthodox, so no.
Bart:	Please, your Honor?  [puppy-dog look]
Harm:	Oh, I can't resist that look.  You remind me of me, when I 
	was a little boy.
Bart:	Your Honor, it's not easy being my parents.  I'm always 
	screwing up in school, and getting in trouble with the 
	law.  But if I grow up to be a halfway decent person, I 
	know it will be because of my Mom and Dad.  Everyone else 
	might give up on me, but my parents never will.
Lisa:	[sniffles] That's my brother.
Snake:	Um, did she say she used to be a dude?
-- "The Parent Rap"

% Bart finishes up his plea on his parents' behalf.

Bart:	So your Honor, if you're going to punish anyone in this 
	courtroom today, I ask that you punish me.
Harm:	Okay, I will.  Bartholomew Simpson, I hereby sentence you 
	to five years in juvenile hall.  [Homer and Marge gasp]
	[Judge Harm is about to bring the gavel down when Judge 
	Snyder comes into the room and stops her]
Snyder:	Well, I'm back from vacation.
Harm:	But I was just about to bang my gavel, making the sentence 
	official.
Snyder:	Sorry, I've already put my clown down.  [indicates his 
	clown figurine]
Harm:	But I was just going to --
Snyder:	[insistently] The clown is down.
Harm:	Augh!  [runs from the courtroom]
Lisa:	Judge Snyder, motion to declare a writ of "boys will be 
	boys."
Snyder:	Motion granted.  [bangs gavel] Case dismissed.
Family:	Woo hoo!
-- Justice, Springfield style, "The Parent Rap"

% The family happily drives home from the courthouse.

Marge:		All right, we got lucky that time, but I want 
		everyone in this family to raise your hand and 
		promise not to break the law for one full year.
Homer +
 Bart +
 Lisa:		We promise.
		[Homer notices he's about to run a red light.  He 
		gasps, and hits the breaks]
Homer:		Whoo!  That was close.
Moleman:	Please drive off me.
		[Homer looks out the window and sees Moleman under 
		the car's front tire]
Homer:		[apprehensive noise]
Marge:		Hmmm, what's that noise?.
Homer:		Uh, just the radio, dear.  [turns on the radio]
-- "The Parent Rap"

% The light changes, and Homer drives away.  Moleman gets up, dusts 
% himself off, and crosses the street.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time:  22:10]
%
% The opening bars of Blue Oyster Cult's "Don't Fear the Reaper" (with 
% plenty of cowbell) play during the start of the closing credits.  
% The Gracie Noise is Homer screaming, "Cobras!  Cobras!"
