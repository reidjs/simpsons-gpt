==============================================================================
   Britney Spears is a guest voice as the Simpsons housesit for Mr. Burns.  It
   all starts at the Springfield Pride Awards (hosted by Spears and Kent
   Brockman), where Burns is saluted for being Springfield's oldest man.  The
   dubious honor prompts the billionaire to get a checkup at the Mayo Clinic,
   and he chooses Homer to watch the mansion, figuring the employee is "due
   for a good performance."

   Well, not so fast, money breath.  Homer turns Burns's yacht (the "Gone
   Fission") into Party Central on a voyage with his pals in international
   waters, "the land that law forgot."  Meanwhile, doctors find Burns has
   "everything" - but "in perfect balance."  (8 p.m./ET, Fox)

                CLASS CLOWN IS NOT / A PAID POSITIO  at cutoff

Couch:          Role reversal time.  The family runs to the couch, but Bart
                and Lisa are now the adults, while Homer and Marge are the
                children.  Maggie is the same size she always is.  Homer
                carries her to the couch, and reaches for the remote when he
                sits.  Lisa slaps his wrist, and takes the remote.  Homer
                sounds disappointed.

   ... the Springfield award show aired at the same time [in the United
       States] as the Golden Globe Awards on NBC?
   ... Moe, who was upside down in the net, apparently drowned?

   ... most of the awards looked like the statue, but the oldest man award was
       a bust of Jebediah Springfield's head?

   ... at some point between the time Smithers took his vacation and the
       present, Burns had his mother "settled"?
   ... at the end of the "Nancy Drew" scene Maggie started to move as if she
       had a bit of business that was edited out for time?  [Fox Wolf says, "I
       put it into slow motion, and she was pulling Lisa's dress.  It was
       supposed to look like she was reaching for it, though."]

Joe Klemm:
   ... Homer and Marge are seen sitting down when everyone is cheering at the
       beginning of the pride awards?
   ... When Kent Brockman asked for people over 60, Ned stood up?
   ... Jasper, as he sat down after him, is older than Abe?
   ... the Burns Playing Poker With Dogs picture and Marge's nude picture of
       Burns in the gallery?
   ... the man marrying a cow, considering that a glass is broken, is probably
       Jewish?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... Mr. Burns leaves an explicit nude of himself hanging on a hallway wall
       for any visitor to take a look at?

Jerry P.:
   ... Burn's crotch in the painting is not covered by the flowers as the
       camera moves left?

   ... a geeky-voiced teen is sitting behind Marge at the awards ceremony?
   ... Abe doesn't sit with the rest of his family?

*  There are legal limits to how much blood you can donate, and I doubt they'd
   take so much Marge would faint (unless she's anemic, in which case they'd
   have stopped her after the first time).  {nc}

=  In the large crowd shot, Abe is seen at the bottom center of the screen
   with a nobody to the left of him, and Ned is in the exact center, but later
   on when Abe has a sitter on him, Ned is right behind him and Edna is
   sitting to the left of him.  {reg}

*  Shouldn't Jebediah Springfield have built the first log cabin in
   Springfield?  {jg2}

=  Coming out of the awards ceremony, Bart and Lisa take a step without
   moving.  {jp2}

*  Homer should not have stuck in the painting.  {jp2}

-  The new bed is missing the mattress before the canopy pops up.  {jp2}

*  When Bart opens the safe, he only moves it clockwise twice (wouldn't this
   kill any purpose of security ... couldn't you just keep turning until the
   right number worked???)  {reg}

=  The artwork on the cover of "Clue in the Clock" looks NOTHING like the
   actual Nancy Drew.  {reg}

+  For most of the episode, Lisa wants to take good care of Mr. Burns's house,
   calling it sacred and helping cleaning, yet she rode a horse through the
   hallway.  {jp2}

*  A social security number has three groups separated by hyphens, and no
   group can be all zeroes.  {th}

=  Lisa is eating sloppy joes, which contain meat.  [Andrew Morin counters,
   "They never specified what the sloppy joes were made out of.  They could
   have made Lisa's out of Tofu or another similar substitute to accommodate
   her."]

*  Mr. Burns' robe fits Homer too nicely considering Homer is pounds heavier.
   {ol}

+  Homer didn't like the bikes with the big front wheels in 2F06.  {er}

*  Isn't the sunline a bit useless, considering that the sun would be in a
   different spot at 2PM every week or something?  {reg}

+  In "The Trouble with Trillions" Homer seems to grasp the idea of
   International water.  {nc}

-  The Tyson vs. Secretariat poster is not on Moe's wall until Moe points to
   it.  {ol}

-  In 4F03, Mike Tyson and Lucious Sweet were too different people.  Here,
   they look the same.  {er}

*  I notice Barney wasn't at Moe's when Homer named everyone in the bar, but
   appears when Homer says everyone is invited to his party.  Was he in the
   bathroom?  I would think he would want to watch the sun also.  {jp2}

+  In "There's No Disgrace Like Home," and pretty much ever other episode with
   Burns Manor as a setting, there was no waterfront, or dock, on the backside
   of the estate.  {nc}

*  Ship captains, on their own authority, cannot perform marriages.  See
   <http://www.urbanlegends.com/misc/married_at_sea.html>.  [Also, See
   "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]  {hl}

-  The dancing bull and man are missing an arm each in one cel that repeats.
   {jp2}

=  The two monkeys swap sides instantaneously.  {jp2}

-  The "got tumor?" billboard was gone when they showed the Mayo Clinic after
   the first time.  {th}

=  At the doctor's office, the clock changes from 2:02 to 3:09 back to 2:02.
   {kc}

=  There were MUCH fewer novelty germs when the doctor was trying to push them
   through the door.  {fw}

=  The oversized novelty germs change size.  {cg}

*  The Coast Guard does have legal authority to intervene in case of a ship
   hijacking if the ship is of US origin or is headed to a US port.  {nc}

=  When the net is bobbing in the water, the net itself seems to bob
   differently from the ball of people.  {ddg}

=  The snack machine "magically" appears at the end in Burn's mansion.  {wb}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Nathan Birch:  Well it's another pointless "caper" episode from veteran writer
   John Swartzwelder, who in my opinion should think about taking a break (or
   at least write less than 6 episodes a season).  While the plot was pretty
   simple and superficial, at least the timing was better than usual.  The
   jokes for the most part were pretty good, and they benefited from John's
   experience with the show, as the felt like Simpsons jokes, and contained a
   number of relatively well done META refs.  In addition this episode managed
   to focus on all members of the family instead of just one or two, and for
   the most part the family stayed nicely in character.  The problem is, is
   that this show used to deliver good jokes, as well as original intelligent
   plots, as it is this episode provided an entertaining if brainless
   half-hour.  (B)

Sarah Culp:  Great first act, easily on par with earlier, more revered
   seasons.  The whole awards show had me chuckling, as well as Burns'
   "speech."  The second act was almost as good, for the first few minutes,
   but then came the stupidity.  The ass-scratcher, the swirled drink getting
   everywhere ...  Marge's hair drooping in the steam room was a nice touch,
   but was canceled out by Monty getting his face sucked into the tube.  I
   liked Lenny and Carl's sun-watching, hated the entire
   stealing-the-yacht-to-sail-out-of-U.S-so-Homer-and-.co-can-drink plot.  It
   all averaged out to a  (C)

Don Del Grande:  This review can be summed up in four parts: awards ceremony
   with some lame Kent Brockman - Britney Spears routine - not funny; Homer
   makes a mess in Burns Manor - not funny; Homer and his friends go on a
   yacht, get caught by pirates, get thrown overboard, and that's pretty much
   it - not funny; Homer makes an inside joke about overpaid actors - okay,
   maybe that was a little funny.  Maybe Swartzwelder is saving what good
   material he hasn't used already in case there ever is a movie?  (C)

Nicholas Di Candia:  Many things bothered me about this episode: the Britney
   Spears appearance (I miss the times when "celebrities" would mock
   themselves), the fork joke (do you remember when The Simpsons used to make
   fun of this kind of humor?), the pirates (why on Earth do they have to make
   every episode a wacky adventure?) and the awful ending.  I did laugh at
   some things: the Grammy disclaimer, the Tyson fight on international
   waters, the burning beds and a couple more.  This was easily the worst of
   the season.  (D)

Curtis Gibby:  Pretty dang good episode.  "Took a bullet for Huey Long" had me
   rolling. The first and third acts were the best, in my opinion.  Overall, I
   give it an  (A)

Tony Hill:  This episode was downright silly.  It was hard to tell even what
   the plot was. What was the plot?  Once again we have another superfluous
   guest voice. There was plenty of comedy material within the mansion without
   the ridiculous "international waters" plot, whose donne was that Moe, who
   runs a book-making operation, would refuse to sell beer during blue hours
   on Sunday.  (D)

Carl Johnson:  A rare venture into mediocrity whereby everything bad is
   balanced by something equally good.  I really wish they would stop bringing
   gratuitous guest stars into the show, but just about all the scenes with
   Mr. Burns were great.  The Tyson-Secretariat poster was the funniest thing
   I've seen in some time.  A solid  (C)

Darrel Jones:  More proof OFF's writers still have it.  Except for a few
   ludicrous moments during the last act (the "net in the water" gag, for
   example), nothing was horribly wrong.  Both of the "in-jokes" were
   excellent.  I liked both Homer's gang in international waters, and Burns at
   the Mayo Clinic.  Even Britney Spears's appearance was pretty cool.  (A)

Roy Kassinger:  I really enjoyed act one ... sorta liked act two ... and
   thought the episode took a wrong turn as soon as Moe mentioned the
   'international waters' thing <Since when does Moe obey laws?  And if he
   can't sell anything, why is he even open?>.  I think there were enough
   jokes here and there <"Mom!  Bart's making faces at me ... I think", Burns
   getting jammed in the CAT scan like a paper copier, "I'm drunk!",  Homer's
   talking through the end credits> to award it a  (B-)

Joe Klemm:  The writers did a good job keeping things balanced with this
   episode.  With a plot line that can carry a lot of jokes, a celebrity cameo
   that's not too long or not too short, and a hilarious bit at during the
   closing credits (especially Homer calling "Shooshie" a rich bastard), this
   has all the works for a good episode.  However, there was a major flaw in
   it with the idea of Pirates taking over Burns's ship (I'd would have like
   to seen Homer accidentally stop the pirates attack.  Other than that, this
   was a clever episode.  (B)

Ondre Lombard:  Simpsons is not an absurd adventure comedy, and this episode
   definitely proves that.  I believe Lisa is the only thing, period, that I
   liked about this episode.  (For example, it's cute when she holds Maggie
   and then reads Nancy Drew.  [...])  Britney Spears was useless; Mr. Burns
   has turned into a completely farcical caricature; it's completely
   unbelievable that Burns would let some slob whose identity he can never
   remember take care of his house when he's got dozens of cronies and
   associates he'd be more likely to leave his house to.  There are countless
   other things flamboyantly sucked.  I imagine even Seinfeld's stories had
   more point to them than this episode (and most episodes of late) had.
   Utter trash.  (F)

Patrick McGovern:  Hm.  I keep telling you people that Swartzwelder has been
   falling -- here's your proof.  I have very little to say on the episode
   (except that I laughed a few -- very few -- times at Burns and Lenny), but
   it makes me appreciate "Take my wife, Sleaze" (an ep I was much too hard
   on) much more.  Worst episode of the season, and worst since "Maximum
   Homerdrive".  Oh yeah, and Britney Spears' appearance was just pointless.
   As if there was any doubt.  (D-)

Michael Nusair:  A very silly episode.  I thought that the first act was
   really good, and had quite a few funny parts.  The look on Lenny's face
   during the awards show was hilarious.  The second act was also okay, but
   the third act was just silly, and not very funny at all.  And that pirate
   stuff was just plain stupid.  So basically, the first half of the show was
   good, the second half ...  Not so much.  (C+)

Chris Palm:  The first time I watched this episode, it left me feeling a
   little flat.  I then waited a few days to re-watch it.  MUCH better the
   second time around.  Wackiness, yes, but at least most of it was REALISTIC
   wackiness, if you know what I mean.  The first act with the awards show was
   excellent; the second half slipped in quality a bit, but was still very
   good; then the wacky third act, which wasn't nearly as bad as it could have
   been.  (A-)

Damian Penny:  In a generally mediocre season, this one was a welcome return
   to form. Consistently funny all the way through, especially the unexpected
   Grammy Awards "disclaimer" and the oldest man in Springfield taking a
   bullet -- unfortunately, just one -- for Huey Long.  Even a rather abrupt
   ending was redeemed by a funny (though truncated -- see below [in the
   "Comments" section]) closing-credits gag.  (A-)

Evan Ross:  Oh, jeez!  This was an instant classic.  Finally, Homer is
   actually seen working at SNPP (I think the first time this season).
   Numerous laugh-out loud jokes involving Homer's "living the high life";
   Homer was shown as a truly likeable guy.  He wants to be rich, but can't.
   Mr. Burns is great comic fodder, and he's continually getting funnier as
   the series progresses.  All of OFF was featured in good amounts, which is a
   change from the Homer-dominated episodes.  The ending was a bit surreal,
   and took a little away from the episode.  Other than that, it was great!
   (A-)

Eric Sansoni:  Here's an episode that revisits the gentle and inventive
   comedic tone of the show's past.  The emphasis is on a barrage of clever
   sight gags, not shock value.  Celebrities are not rabidly insulted, and the
   small number of violence and gross-out gags are executed with restraint.
   The plot is smoothly handled, coming out of the intro via a nice satirical
   transition, then sensibly developing into three interrelated threads that
   wrap up in ironic ways.  Some moments (Burns' clones) work better than
   others (Barney is the wino, not Homer), but none insult your intelligence
   or make you scratch your head.  The storyline is less than gripping to say
   the least, but the whole thing is a pleasant diversion.  (B)

Marco Trevisiol:  While the combination of Swartzwelder and Homer/Burns has
   worked out better in the past, this was still a satisfying episode.  The
   Springfield Pride Awards were quite funny (despite being a combined rehash
   of parts of 1F13 and 8F23) and the ending was spot-on as Swartzwelder had
   made the moral of 'you don't have to be rich to be happy' into such a trite
   one that there was nowhere else for the episode to finish.  (B+)

Yours Truly:  "The Mansion Family" has a good premise, but is let down by the
   execution.  The opening award ceremony was funny, but after that the show
   goes into its "anything goes" mode.  I liked some of the jokes, such as the
   scene where the family sits down to dine at Burns' impossibly long table,
   but too many of the rest depend on "Richie Rich"-style hardware.  On the
   other hand, Burns' subplot was amusing and inventive, and Britney Spears'
   appearance was better than I thought it would be.  In the end, "The Mansion
   Family" isn't humor-impoverished, but the show is not as rich in laughs as
   it should be.  (C+)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B- (2.56)   Std Dev.: 1.1203   (30 reviews computed)

>> Those eternal threads

 - Where is Springfield?

Tony Hill says:  Not in Minnesota.


Kyle Noskoviak adds:  We now have a location lock on Springfield.  It is
   definitely on the ocean, as it is visible from international waters.  So
   it's one of the maritime states with the postal abbreviation NT.  That
   narrows it down.


>> Meta-reference Corner

Benjamin Robinson:  During the credits, Homer says the cast isn't as rich as
   they should be.  This is probably a reference to the tense salary
   negotiations between the voice cast and Fox, which took place not long
   before this episode first aired.


>> Musical References

Sam Bell:  The song [the Coast Guard man was singing] was "china grove" by the
   Doobie Bros.


>> Is this seat taken?

Benjamin Robinson:  If there's one thing that producers of award shows such as
   the Oscars like to see, it's a packed house.  Empty seats in the auditorium
   stick out to the observant viewer, like the one burnt-out bulb in a movie
   theater marquee.  The producers solved this problem by designating their
   young interns to be "seat fillers."  Whenever someone in the audience
   leaves his seat -- to accept an award, for example -- the seat filler
   rushes in and fills the empty spot until the original seat-holder returns.
   The show producer is happy, because there's no unsightly gaps in the
   audience.  The seat fillers are happy because they get to dress up and rub
   elbows with the stars.  (Alas, they can't talk to them -- that's verboten.)
   As for the stars themselves, well, um, they get a nice warm seat when they
   return.


>> Parade of celebrities

Benjamin Robinson provides some mini-biographies:

   Britney Spears:  Ms. Spears has a few hit singles to her credit.
   Unfortunately they're from the same school as Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync
   which means Spears has the same credibility as, oh, Backstreet Boys and 'N
   Sync.  Rumors abound that Spears' breasts have been surgically enhanced,
   but she steadfastly denies this.

   Al Unser, Jr.:  Race-car driver.  Unser is part of a family of drivers who
   have conquered the Indy 500.  Unser, his dad (Al Unser, duh), and Bobby
   Unser have something like ten Indy victories among them.

   Princess Margaret:  Sister of Elizabeth II, Queen of England.  The whole
   Windsor family is horse-happy, which explains why Lisa sees herself as the
   Princess while riding through the Burns mansion.  Here's an interesting
   coincidence (interesting if you're a naming freak like me):  "Lisa" is a
   variant of the root name "Elizabeth," while "Maggie" is a nickname for
   "Margaret."  Pity there's no "Bartholomew" in the royal family.

   Jimmy Smits:  Handsome actor who appeared on "LA Law," as a member of the
   Mackenzie & Brackman firm.  He left that show, and a few years later turned
   up on "NYPD Blue," replacing that Caruso fellow as he went on to movie
   mega-stardom.


Haynes Lee adds:

   Charles Manson:  Psycho hippie whose "family" murdered Roman Polanski's
   pregnant wife Sharon Tate and her other house guests.  (this is an old
   reference which is lost on viewers younger than 103 years)


>> The beer of Danish kings!

Our man in Denmark, Claus Rasmussen, reports:  In "The Mansion Family" Homer
   asks Moe for his best foreign sounding imported beer, and Moe suggests
   Tuborg, "The Beer of Danish Kings".

   Tuborg is not only foreign sounding, it is also an actual beer, which can
   be bought in every single Danish supermarket (except for SHØP, and only by
   people over 15, that is).  [John Jensen notes, "It also is sold in the US"
   -- Ed.]  It used to be the second largest label in Denmark, until it joined
   with Carlsberg and Forenede Bryggerier (United Breweries) and formed
   Carlsberg A/S, but the labels are still sold separately.

   Moe's "The Beer of Danish Kings"-quote probably refers to the classical
   Danish phrase: "Leverandør til det kongelige danske hof" (Purveyor to the
   Royal Danish Court), which is used on everything from ketchup bottles to
   beer.  And yes, Tuborg uses that line, too.


John Jensen goes on to add:  In fact the joke would have been much funnier if
   Moe had said Meister Brau. That is a foreign SOUNDING beer that is swilled
   right here in the good ole US.


>> got mayo?

Tony Hill notes:  Not egregious enough to be a goof, the Mayo Clinic in
   Rochester, Minn. doesn't look much like the campus shown, although the
   modern building at right looked somewhat like the modern cruciform building
   at the center of the complex.  Incidentally, the clinic is officially Mayo
   Medical Center, although nearly everyone calls it by its traditional name.


>> A box *what* now?

David G. Hill explains:  A "box social" is a type of mixer from the turn of
   the century or even earlier. The women of a town make box lunches, which
   are then bid on by the men, with the winner getting to eat the lunch with
   the maker of the lunch.  Just up Homer's alley


James Allen adds:  An example of one was in the film/play "Oklahoma."


>> "When the sun hits this line, we can drink again!"

Eric May asks:  Why did Moe say that they had wait until 2pm to drink.  What
   was he talking about?


Mark J. Finegold answers:  Many, if not most states do not permit the sale of
   alcohol on Sunday morning.  Here in Michigan, the start time is 12 noon.
   The thinking is that hey, what the hell are you doing with a beer on Sunday
   morning, why aren't you in church?


James Allen:  Same in NJ.  Bars and liquors stores don't open until noon.
   Further, individual towns/counties can set their own hours as well.  There
   is still a county in NJ [Bergen County] where retail stores can't be open
   on Sunday.


Daniel McConnell adds to the list:  Indiana, and I think Pennsylvania, (and
   surely many more) both forbid selling alcohol on Sunday.


Speaking of Pennsylvania, Keystone State resident John Jensen writes:  First
   off there's the whole beer/liquor ordeal.  BEER can only be purchased in
   cases at a distributor.  (same place you'd get a keg ...) 6 Packs can only
   be purchased for carry out from a bar, and THEN you are limited to 2.  You
   can not buy any beer or liquor from grocery or convenience stores.  That
   would be a little TOO convenient.

   Then, up until a couple years ago, you weren't allowed to advertise any
   prices in liquor ads.  That means bars had a HELL of a time getting people
   to come to happy hour.  But they lifted that insanity.

   Sundays are dry--no bars--but restaurants are allowed to serve.


Ken Farris:  In Georgia (yes, there is a Springfield Ga.)  It's illegal to
   sell alcohol on Sundays for liquor stores, grocery stores, and bars.
   Exceptions are made if you serve food, such as a restaurant, then you can
   serve all day.  Very odd.  [Hmm ... doesn't Moe serve pickled eggs?  That's
   sort of a food -- Ed.]


Nor Cal explains the reason for all these crazy laws:  The Sunday alcohol laws
   are a holdover from Puritan times.  In those days it was actually against
   the law to not go to church on Sunday!  To discourage people from non
   church functions certain laws were enacted to keep people in the pews.  A
   ban on alcohol sales was one of them, other laws restricted bank
   transactions, or even farm harvesting.  A lot of these laws were repealed,
   or modified over the years.  Some states began just having time limits,
   like before 2:00PM.  Indiana, Pennslyvania, and South Carolina still retain
   these laws.  Lots of New England small towns still harbor them too.  This
   March South Carolina will have a ballot proposition to repeal this old
   outdated legislation. I feel it is an inherent violation of the 1st
   amendment, and should therefore be illegal by way of Supreme Court action.
   But I don't recommend alcohol consumption of any kind.


>> They also can't perform a briss at sea

Richard E. Green quotes a book called, "Everything You Know is Wrong":  "At
   the end of 'African Queen', Bogart and Hepburn are married by the captain
   of a ship that rescued them, so they can enjoy conjugal bliss until their
   obvious and complete incompatibility catches up with them in a week or so.
   Adding spice to the relationship is the fact that they wouldn't actually be
   legally married.  The captain of a ship has no particular power to perform
   weddings, as was established in a 1898 case, Norman v Norman.  Regulations
   in the US, British and Soviet navies, as well as those of other nations,
   specifically prohibit a commanding officer from performing marriage
   ceremonies.  The belief that the captain has such authority is probably
   based on the almost total power he exercises while at sea"

   [Mr. Green adds, "Then again, McAllister isn't a real captain and
   everything over international water IS legal!"]


>> "Frankly, sir, one is too many."

Speaking of urban legends, Daniel L. Dreibelbis writes:  Smithers having been
   told by the Mayo Clinic that a creature (an earwig?) laid eggs in his brain
   [is an urban legend]. This legend (which is referred to by Jan Harold
   Brunvand as "A Bug In The Ear") can be found in Brunvand's book CURSES!
   BROILED AGAIN! on pages 40-43.


>> Life imitates art

Haynes Lee:  Last week the major U.S. Television networks (including Fox)
   launched a lawsuit against the Canadian internet company ICRAVETV.COM for
   broadcasting their signals over the internet in a similar way the boat with
   the giant dish was re-broadcasting major league games.


>> Car Watch of the Rich and Famous

Benjamin Robinson:  Burns' car -- at least the one Homer drove to the tavern -
   - closely resembled a Rolls Royce Phantom VI.  The real thing didn't have
   three ignition switches or live fox-stole seat belts, but then again there
   was a certain degree of customization involved in building these.


>> The closing credits Fox didn't want you to hear!

Damian Penny discovers a good reason to live in Canada:  The episode ends with
   Homer crying about how he is no longer rich like all the people whose names
   show up in the closing credits.  Airing on Fox, the closing credits
   prematurely end so a Malcolm in the Middle promo can run; I saw the episode
   earlier on NTV (CTV affiliate in St. John's, Newfoundland), and Homer keeps
   crying all the way to the Gracie Films logo.  When the "Supervising
   Producer for Gracie Films" credit comes up, Homer stops crying and says
   "Ah, he's poor".  Hopefully we'll get another look at this in syndication.

   [Boo!  It used to be that when a running gag ran past the final scene, Fox
   would leave the end credits alone.  They picked a fine time to change their
   minds -- Ed.]


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Simpsons Family Values


Wilson Banswell reports (via UltimateTV.com) that "The Mansion Family"
   garnered 12.5 rating (17 share) the night it aired.


Sarah Culp:  The first Nancy Drew book was actually called "The Secret of the
   Old Clock."  I guess they embellished the title to compensate for the
   edited profanity.


Curtis Gibby:  To me, Britney Spears looked like an animated Baby Spice
   (shudder), not herself.


Tony Hill:  Secretariat, who won the Triple Crown in 1973, died at 19 in 1989.


Benjamin Robinson:  There really are banned Nancy Drew (and Hardy Boys) books,
   but this is because they used outdated racial and ethnic stereotypes.


Benjy Shyovitz:  The cow smashing the glass during its wedding on the boat is
   a reference to Jewish weddings.  The husband smashes a glass under his foot
   just as they are pronounced by the rabbi to be husband & wife.

% As the night wears on, everyone in the auditorium has collected an
% award.  That is, everyone except Homer.

Homer:	Everyone gets an award but me.
Marge:	I can't help it if I donated the most blood.  Ohh, but I'm 
	feeling kind of woozy.
	[passes out.  Homer reaches for her award, but she rouses 
	herself in time to slap away his hand]
Homer:	Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?
Lisa:	You won a Grammy.
Homer:	I mean an award that's worth winning.
	["award show"-style music plays while a disclaimer scrolls

		[applause.  A film showing highlights of Mr. 
		Chapman's life begins to play]
Britney:	Cornelius Chapman built the first log cabin in 
		Springfield, and introduced the toothbrush to our 
		fair city.  [the film shows residents of the town 
		pondering this new invention, and then using it.  
		They smile widely]
Kent:		For years, he was Springfield's only basketball 
		player, but he still managed to entertain the crowd.  
		[Chapman dribbles the ball, and tries a pass, but 
		there's no one there to catch it]
Britney:	In the market crash of 1929, he helped people jump 
		out of windows to avoid disgrace.
		[the film shows Chapman doing just that]
Chapman:	[on film] You're doing the right thing.  Oh, oh, out 
		you go!  [a heavyset man appears at the window] My, 
		you're a big one.  No, no, no ... no turning back 
		now.  [the heavyset man jumps]
		[cut to the audience]
Moe:		Off a tall building -- that's a great way to do it!
		[back to the stage]
Kent:		And in 1935, our honoree took a bullet for Huey 
		Long.
		[in the film, Chapman dives in front of a bullet 
		meant for Mr. Long.  Unfortunately, several other 
		bullets have already struck Long]

Homer:	What about par-tay?
Marge:	No part-tays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no 
	mixers, no raves, no box socials.
Homer:	Damn!  And I looked so good on that bike!  [looks at a box 
	social invitation, which has a picture of him on an old-
	fashioned bicycle.  Marge takes it from him]
-- Box social pooper, "The Mansion Family"

% At the Mayo Clinic, Burns asks the doctor to test him for
% everything, gesturing to a chart entitled, "Diseases You Can Have."  
% The doctor starts by trying to draw a blood sample, but the
% syringe's needle pokes clean through Burns' arm.  Burns offers his
% other arm, since he saw some blood there the other day.
%
% Next, Burns is tested on a breath-endurance machines.  It's one of
% those contraptions where the patient blows into a tube of liquid to
% keep a ping-pong ball aloft.  After blowing for a few seconds,
% Burns' face is sucked twelve centimeters into the machine.  The
% nurse on duty deems this a good result.
%
% Burns is a bit too old for the stair-climber test, so the clinic
% uses an escalator test instead.  Burns rides up a short (perhaps two
% feet high) escalator, than takes a down-escalator back to where he
% started.
%
% Finally, Burns is put through a CAT-scan machine.  Unfortunately,
% his body jams in the mechanism, and a technician is called in to
% free him.
%
% While Burns is extricated from the scanner, Homer drives one of the
% old man's cars to Moe's Tavern.

Homer:	Having a party, Moe.  I'll need four kegs of your finest 
	imported-sounding beer.
Moe:	How 'bout Tuborg -- the beer of Danish kings.
Homer:	Mmmm ... danish.
Moe:	Now you know I can't sell you no beer until 2 p.m. on 
	account of it's Sunday.
Homer:	Huh?  If you can't sell beer what are Lenny and Carl doing 
	here?
Carl:	Huh?  Oh, we're just watching the sun move across the sky.
	[points to a sunbeam shining through the door window onto 
	the tavern floor.  A line labeled "Drinking Time" is 
	inscribed on the floor]
Lenny:	When it gets to here, [indicates the line] we can drink 
	again.
Homer:	But I need that beer now!
Moe:	Sorry, 2 p.m.  Or you can steal a boat and sail out to 
	international waters, heh.
Homer:	What's that, a theme park?
Moe:	No, the ocean.  Once you get twelve miles out, there's no 
	laws at all.  That's where they held the Tyson-Secretariat 
	fight.  [indicates a souvenir poster from that bout]
Homer:	[laughs] They were so drunk.  Gentlemen, get off your 
	knees.  Your rich uncle Homer is throwing the wildest box 
	social the high seas have ever seen!  [leaves]
	[opens door and pokes head back in]
	And you're invited.
	[bar patrons cheer]
-- Oh, *now* you say so, "The Mansion Family"

% Marge somehow gets wind of the plan and tries to stop Homer and his
% party posse from boarding the yacht.  Homer says it's now or never
% for the party, since he may never be rich for real.  Marge starts to
% say something doubtlessly touching about how she'll always love her
% husband, but she's interrupted when Lenny announces he found another
% way onto the boat.  The partygoers stream up the gangplank, leaving
% Marge alone on the dock.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  11:39]
%
% Cap'n Homer gives the command to set sail.  Lisa tries to reassure
% her mother, but Marge can't help but notice that the boat is leaving
% the dock sideways.  A well-placed jetty knocks the vessel into the
% proper orientation, and the party boat is on its way.

Carl:	Homer, have we hit international waters yet?  Because, eh, 
	things are gettin' real ugly.
	[cut to Moe, who stands in front of a keg of beer, holding 
	off the advancing crowd with a bullwhip]
Moe:	I can't sell you beer until we cross the line!
Barney:	Legally, you can give us free beer.
	[Moe whips him] Ow!
-- Or maybe not, "The Mansion Family"

% Lenny asks Moe for some rubbing alcohol, and Moe tosses him a
% bottle.  When he tries to drink it, Moe whips the bottle out of his
% hands.
%
% Finally, the yacht crosses the line.

We made it son.  International waters -- the land that law forgot!
-- Homer Simpson, "The Mansion Family"

% Homer is not the only one taking advantage of the high sea's lax
% legal standards.  On one yacht, a bevy of bikini-clad women dance to
% the latest tunes.  Cowboys on another vessel brawl like they were in
% a wild, wild Western movie.  On another boat, a live bullfight takes
% place.  Bart is impressed.

Bart:	Wow, you can do anything out here!
Homer:	That's right.  See that ship over there?  [points to a 
	ship with a large satellite dish on it] They're re-
	broadcasting Major League Baseball with implied oral 
	consent, not express written consent -- or so the legend 
	goes.
-- "The Mansion Family"

% On yet another ship, Cap'n McAllister marries a man and a cow. 
% After the cow breaks the ritual wedding glass (hey, at least the
% man's marrying a kosher animal), the Cap'n presents the wedded
% couple with a basket of illegal fireworks.
%
% Back on Burns' yacht, Homer exults, "There are no laws!  We can do
% anything we want -- anything!"  Lenny kicks him in the shins, and
% Homer berates his lack of maturity.  (Lenny's, that is, not Homer's
% own.)
%
% At the Mayo Clinic, Burns receives the results of his tests.

Burns:	Well, doc, I think I did pretty well on my tests.  You may 
	shake my hand if you like.
Doctor:	Well, under the circumstances, I'd rather not.
Burns:	Eh?
Doctor:	Mr. Burns, I'm afraid you are the sickest man in the 
	United States.  You have everything.
Burns:	You mean I have pneumonia?
Doctor:	Yes.
Burns:	Juvenile diabetes?
Doctor:	Yes.
Burns:	Hysterical pregnancy?
Doctor:	Uh, a little bit, yes.  You also have several diseases 
	that have just been discovered -- in you.
Burns:	I see.  You sure you haven't just made thousands of 
	mistakes?
Doctor:	Uh, no, no, I'm afraid not.
Burns:	This sounds like bad news.
Doctor:	Well, you'd think so, but all of your diseases are in 
	perfect balance.  Uh, if you have a moment, I can explain.
Burns:	Well ... [looks at his watch]
	[the Doctor puts a tiny model house door on his desk]
Doctor:	Here's the door to your body, see?  [bring up some small 
	fuzz balls with goofy faces and limbs from under the desk]  
	And these are oversized novelty germs.  [points to a 
	different one up as he names each disease] That's 
	influenza, that's bronchitis, [holds up one] and this cute 
	little cuddle-bug is pancreatic cancer.  Here's what 
	happens when they all try to get through the door at once.  
	[tries to cram a bunch through the model door.  The 
	"germs" get stuck]
	[Stooge-like] Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!  Move it, 
	chowderhead!
	[normal voice] We call it, "Three Stooges Syndrome."
Burns:	So what you're saying is, I'm indestructible!
Doctor:	Oh, no, no, in fact, even slight breeze could --
Burns:	Indestructible.
-- Diagnosis:  Indestructible, "The Mansion Family"

% Marge and Lisa busily clean the house, upholding the sacred bond to
% keep the place exactly as Burns left it.  They even scrub down a
% laboratory, even though the family was never in there.  Several jars
% in the lab contain homunculi that resemble Burns and Smithers. 
% Unfazed, Marge cleans a spot of dirt from one of the jars.
%
% The party rolls on full blast in international waters.  Homer
% considers the lives of those back on land, smugly noting they are
% unaware of "the simple joys of a monkey knife fight."  (One of which
% is taking place on the yacht at that very moment.)
%
% Bart teases a Coast Guard cutter holding position just inside United
% States national waters.

Bart:	[through a bullhorn] Hey, Coast Guard!  Try to stop us 
	now, you lousy Americans.
Coast
 Guard:	[through a loudspeaker] We can't hear you!  Come three 
	hundred feet closer!
Bart:	Nice try.  You're not going to nail us.
Coast
 Guard:	But we just want to party.
Bart:	Oh, really?  Then play some rock music.
	[Man on cutter mimics the guitar riff from "China Grove"]
Homer:	[joins in] Come on, Bart!  The Coast Guard's covering the 
Doobs!
	[Bart and Homer continue mimicking the music, and start 
	dancing] Who's the greatest millionaire in the world?  
	[the other guests join in]
Crowd:	You are!
-- Party on, Homer, "The Mansion Family"

% Homer's bash soon draws unwanted attention from pirates.  Peering 
through a spyglass, he sees the party on Burns' boat.

Mate:		[collapsing the spyglass] Looks like another 
		homosexual party boat.  They always have such nice 
		things.
Captain:	Perhaps we should pay them a visit.
Mate:		A deadly visit?
Captain:	Well, let's play it by ear.
-- "The Mansion Family"

% Unaware of the danger, Homer keeps dancing on the deck of the yacht. 
% He momentarily dances away from the crowd, and then back toward
% them.  In this brief span of time, his party guests are replaced by
% the menacing pirates.  Homer tries his away-and-back move once more,
% but the pirates are still there.
%
% Homer asks the captain if they are friendly pirates; needless to
% say, they are not.  Underscoring this point, Homer's guests are
% trapped in a net suspended ten or twenty feet above the deck.  The
% pirates probe the net with sticks, releasing coins, wallets, and
% Moe's bus pass.
%
% The captain sets a course for "Hidden Pirate Island," which is also
% called "Hong Kong."  Homer desperately calls the Coast Guard for
% assistance.

Homer:	Help!  Pirates!
Coast
 Guard:	Navy SEALs are on the way.
Homer:	Oh, bless you.
Coast
 Guard:	How about a tactical nuclear strike?
Homer:	Oh, that would be just ... [realizes] oh, you're just 
	yanking my chain, aren't you?
Coast
 Guard:	Perhaps this foghorn will answer your question.  [foghorn 
	makes the "mwah-mwaaaah" sound]
-- "The Mansion Family"

% The pirates order Homer into the net.  He refuses and fights the
% captain, knocking off all four of the parrots riding the pirate's
% shoulders.  Grabbing a knife from one of the fighting monkeys in one
% hand, Homer climbs a ladder and reaches for a rope.  He tries to
% swing down to the weather deck, but rope burns make him lose his
% grip.  He crashes on the deck and suddenly gets charley horse. 
% Clasping the knife in his mouth, he massages his calf.  The knife
% cuts his lips, and when Homer lets go of it, it sticks in his left
% hand.  Surrounded, Homer concedes defeat, and winds up in the net
% with the other guests.
%
% The pirates have moved the net, so that it is now suspended over the
% ocean.

Lenny:		Some party, Homer.
Homer:		Shut up, Net Face.
Lenny:		Hey, you're in the net, too.
Homer:		I said, shut up, Net Face!
Moe:		Aw, we're going to die and I never tasted 
		cantaloupe.
Krusty:		Eh, you didn't miss much.  Honeydew is the money 
		melon.
Captain:	And now, we will cut you loose.  For liability 
		purposes, it is he ocean that will kill you, not us.
-- Ferocious *and* legally savvy, "The Mansion Family"

% The net falls into the sea, and then bobs on the surface.

Moe:	Hey, whaddaya know?  It floats!
Homer:	That was my plan all along.  Now, relax and the currents 
	will take us home.
Bart:	What about the people on the bottom?
Homer:	They're the greatest heroes of all.  Hey!  Something's 
	clawing at my leg!  [pause] Okay, it stopped.
-- "The Mansion Family"

% Thanks to Marge and Lisa, Burns manor's 137 rooms are spic-and-span. 
% Just in time, too, for Burns and Smithers walk up the front steps.

Burns:		Smithers old chum, there's nothing like coming home 
		with a clean bill of health.  Oh, and sorry about 
		your news.
Smithers:	Thank you, sir.
Burns:		Do they know how many eggs it laid in your brain?
Smithers:	I prefer not to know.  Frankly, one is too many.
-- "The Mansion Family"

% Burns takes a quick inventory.  Although the mansion has the "foul
% stench of youth," Burns is glad to see that the Ming vase on the
% narrow column wasn't knocked over, and that no one has fed his rare
% coins into the nearby vending machine.  Homer rushes in, and breaks
% the news about the yacht.  Burns takes it in stride.
%
% The losing monkey from the knife fight stumbles in.  Burns cradles
% him in his arms, and tells Smithers, "This monkey's going to need
% most of your skin."
%
% The Simpsons return to their original home.

Lisa:	Ah, it's good to be home.
Homer:	I don't know; after living like a billionaire, this place 
	is kind of a dump.
Bart:	Nah, it's not so bad.  Here, we can spit on the floor.  
	[does so]
Marge:	Bart, stop that!  [to Homer] Now, we may not have antique 
	furniture, or priceless artwork, but we have everything we 
	need, right here.
Homer:	That's right.  Just because we're not rich doesn't mean 
	that we don't have ... [start to cry] Oh, I can't even 
	finish.  I want to be rich!  [drops to the floor, as the 
	scene fades to black.  The names of the executive 
	producers appear] Like these guys!
	[the credits for the actors roll]
	And look at all these rich people, here!  Not as rich as 
	they should be, of course, but still rich.
	[the Gracie Films logo appears, and the woman shushes 
	someone in the audience]
	Don't shush me, you rich bastard!
