===============================================================================
> Reviews
===============================================================================

A. Warren Pratten {awp}:  I really enjoyed this week's show.  Bart reminded
me of a few guys in public school that were real trouble-makers until they
were made `prefects' by the principal.  From that moment on they became
`holier-than-thou' and the principal's pets.

Andrew Tannenbaum {trb}:  I thought it was a great warped episode, full of
odd references.  I give it a thumbs up.

Alan J. Rosenthal {ajr}:  Oh well, not one of the best.  [Later...]
I changed my mind completely when I watched it for the second time yesterday.
It's actually quite good!  I don't know why I didn't dig it the first time.

Joe Kincaid {jk}:  I really liked this episode.  I was laughing hysterically
all the way through Bart's facist period.

Yours Truly {rjc}:  A good idea that just didn't come together.  Probably
a victim of bad timing, coming too closely on the tail of ``Lisa the Greek'',
so the idea of Lisa gone bad lost its shock value.  And let's hope the
sappy endings aren't making a comeback.

The ``It's funny because it's true'' award goes to Lisa's, ``If
you think it's so great, why don't yoooooou join the band?''  A kid
with an attitude.

> Animation and continuity goofs
===============================================================================
Despite some people's claims that the map on the wall of Bart's classroom
is ``out of this world'', I maintain that it is indeed a map of our planet,
grossly distorted.  Looks like a Mercator projection.

Mrs. Hoover is a Miss again.

Although we are led to believe that the kids actually did stare straight
ahead for fifteen minutes, the wall clock says otherwise.

The lip sync is off for Bart's ``Well, I'll be jiggered!''  Any guesses
as to what Bart <really> said?  Is it printable?

Chief Wiggum's badge vanishes briefly.  And once the bad guy's car stops,
room magically appears around it.

Bart isn't wearing his sash when Skinner discovers the books. {cs}

Rolf Wilson {rw}:  As Bart discovers the locker with the Teacher's Editions,
he takes out 4 books, revealing the family picture.  Then Lisa slams the
locker shut.  In the very next scene, all the books are on the floor of
the hall.  Dave Hall {dh} suggests that this was merely an editing decision.
After all, do we really want to watch Bart take all the books out of the
locker?

Theron Stanford {tws} points out the continuing inconsistency in the
placement of Lisa's and Bart's classrooms.  In the opening of this episode,
Bart's classroom is above Lisa's.  But later, Lisa claps erasers out the
upper-story window, and Bart does his blackboard punishment on the ground
floor.  There are additional inconsistencies in ``Bart the Lover'' and
``Lisa's Substitute''.

From one angle, Bart's second blackboard punishment is written as one
giant paragraph.  But when the angle changes, Bart's punishment puts
each sentence on a line by itself.

>>> The Iowa Standardized Tests

    During the late '70s and early '80s, the Iowa Test of Basic Skills
    was used by many school districts throughout the country.  Merely
    saying the words ``Iowa Test'' to a student would evoke a strong
    reaction.

>>> Previous episodes

    [7G03] ``I will not skateboard in the halls.''
    [7G10] ``Yeah, like I'd want a picture of my butt.''
    [7F07] ``Dear log...'' in a cool kneel-sit chair.  (Recycled animation?)

>> Car chase cliches
   Car chase music.
   The chased car loses a tire rim (not a hubcap) going around a turn.
   Down a San Francisco hill.  (The cars leave the ground when they hit
        a small incline.)
   An oncoming car (punchbuggy green!) swerves into a parked milk truck,
        which explodes into flames.
        (The milk truck looks like a gasoline tanker, except
        it has the word `MILK' painted clearly on the side.)
   Crashing through (empty) boxes.

   Missing:  The cars don't crash through a vegetable stand.  (My personal
   favorite car chase cliche.)

   And listen to Bart's noises as he fires the gun and throws it aside
   afterwards.

>> Cars

noel@umbc2.umbc.edu (no name avail.) identifies the bad guy's car as a
1968 Dodge Charger.  Orange, like ``The Dukes of Hazzard''.

>> The Army thought that Homer was too heavy, and the police thought he
   was too dumb.  Note that the Army didn't think Homer was too dumb
   or the police that he was too heavy. {jk}

>> That's it.  Bart sets the record for having been voiced by the most people.
   Nancy Cartwright, Daniel Stern, Neil Patrick Harris (sort of), and
   Steve Allen.

>> You'd think Jimbo, Kerny, and Dolph would have dropped out of school.

% The next morning, Lisa comes down to breakfast, grousing.  ``Morning,

% opportunity for creativity.  Marge shows Lisa how she arranged the bacon,
% eggs, toast (and sprig of parsley) into a smiley face on the plate.  Lisa
% asks, ``What's the point?  They'll never notice.''  Marge responds,

Skinner: Let's move.
-- Annoyed any Republicans today?  ``Separate Vocations''

% With a Batman-style scene change, Bart and Skinner set to work searching
% the lockers.  They close in on Lisa's locker, and Bart gets there first.
% He's shocked that it's Lisa's locker.  Bart asks her why she did it.
% ``Come on, Bart.  In your pre-fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of
% futile rebellion!''  Bart answers, ``Yeah, but even I had my limits.
% You're looking at expulsion for this.''  Lisa knows, and cries.
%
% Skinner arrives and is elated that the books have been found.  He asks
% who the culprit is, and Bart takes the fall, to the shock of all.
% Bart gloats that he duped Skinner once again, and Skinner decides that
% Bart's service to the school is a mitigating circumstance in his
% punishment.  Four hundred days' detention.  Bart acts cocky until
% it goes up to six hundred days, and Milhouse (the new hall monitor)
% takes Bart away.
%
% Lisa asks Bart why he did what he did.  ``Because I didn't want you
% to wreck your life.  You got the brains and the talent to go as far
% as you want.  And when you do, I'll be right there to borrow money.''
%
% As Bart does yet another blackboard punishment (``I will not expose
% the ignorance of the faculty''), Lisa plays her sax on the bench outside
% the window.  Bart offers some words of encouragement.
