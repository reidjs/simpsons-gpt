> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [TVGuide.com] Richard Gere guest stars in a Christmas episode that spawns a
   crisis of religious conscience in Lisa.  The trouble starts when
   congregants of the First Church of Springfield, faced with a sudden need
   for funds, turn for help to Mr. Burns (Harry Shearer), who turns the church
   into a business ("The old church was skewing pious," says his advisor).
   Enter podium-placed advertising and in-sermon commercials; and exit an
   outraged Lisa.  Her disenchantment leads her to the Springfield Buddhist
   Temple and to Gere, who introduces her to teachings she finds easy to
   embrace.  All of which has Rev. Lovejoy (also Shearer) wondering what to do
   about "Marge Simpson's devil daughter."  {sx}

Blackboard:     I DO NOT HAVE A CEREAL NAMED AFTER ME  {ddg}

Couch:          A giant slot machine sits in the couch's usual spot.  The
                tumblers spin, and eventually come to rest on portraits of
                Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and ... not Maggie.  Instead, the
                final tumbler comes up with Lucky Number 7.  Jackpot!  The
                machine dispenses a pile of gold coins.

> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================

Jeff Cross:
   ... Marge's old coworker Cookie Kwan has her own real estate agency?

Don Del Grande:
   ... the movie was on during a baseball rain delay?  [See "Comments" section
       for more -- Ed.]
   ... Homer's contact lenses seem to disappear, the way his beard seems to
       reappear immediately after he shaves?
   ... in "this universe", somebody thinks "Ally McBeal" is still a great
       show?
   ... the stained glass windows in front of the church are covered with
       artwork, but the others aren't?
   ... the church has "The Ten Suggestions"?
   ... Lisa doesn't have a Christmas stocking?

Vic Fear:
   ... the electric Amish sign?  (Given that the Amish believe in simplicity
       and shy away from modern conveniences like electricity, this has to be
       seen as ironic.)
   ... HJS on nerd's rocket stands for Homer J Simpson?

Alex Foley:
   ... this is the 1st episode written by Bill Freiberger?
   ... Jon Vitti is back as a producer (yeah I know everyone already knew he
       was coming back, but I still find it good news)?
   ... Homer did punch God in a way (by destroying the church)?
   ... Smithers was nowhere to be seen (perhaps he won't attend church because
       of his sexual preference?)?
   ... Paul Reiser's Book was a NY Times Bestseller?

Darrel Jones:
   ... Milhouse walks away with Benjamin, Doug, and Gary after Homer's warning
       of "no nerds allowed"?
   ... the ad for Cookie Kwan from [5F06] on Lovejoy's new pedestal?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Maggie doesn't appear in the couch gag?
   ... the back of the airline seat pews consists of a tray table, a place to
       keep books, and a place to kneel on?

Chad Lehman:
   ... hamster Nibbles can understand English?
   ... despite calling Col. Chip Manners a loser, Bart falls for the
       commercial anyway?
   ... the neon Jesus sign doesn't seem to bother Lisa, but the ads inside the
       church do?
   ... Agnes fans her face when Burns throws the smoke bomb?
   ... Marge's green dress has a collar when she's wearing the sweater, and
       her pearls are gone?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Homer's credit card number is 5783653434107109?
   ... Homer's flossing loosens a tiny chunk of food?
   ... little bits of stained glass continue to fall out of the broken windows
       as Ms. Naegle talks?
   ... Rev. Lovejoy didn't have the ad on his robe during the services?
       (Maybe he didn't sign the deal, after all)
   ... *Patty* knows about the urinal ice?  [shudder]

Steven X:
   ... in the first scene of the show the spaceship did not have "yaw
       control"?  (Man, has technology come a long way or what?)
   ... Milhouse looks strangely similar to Akbar or Jeff when he lost his
       glasses and eyebrows?

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Don Del Grande:  The rocket bit was pretty good, but they didn't do very much
   with the "ads in the church" bit (the "new pew" gag, for example, didn't
   seem to be in place), and then it seemed to be a rehash of the ending of
   "Lisa the Vegetarian" ... and although Lisa has said she would "give lip
   service to Christianity" (the way she does to meat-eaters), are the writers
   going to go out of their way to keep Lisa away from expressing opinions of
   other religions?  (B)

Alex Foley:  The 1st episode of the Al Jean era begins ... and it was decent.
   The major problem with this episode was that it took two acts to get to the
   main thrust of the episode, which is Lisa's crisis of faith.  It would of
   done the story better to cut out the gerbil bit and save it for another
   episode (because it was funny) and get to Burns changing the church and
   Lisa renouncing the Church at the end of Act I instead, which would have
   made the story stronger. Still it was a decent episode with some good LOL
   moments.  Good, but not Great, Start to Al Jean's reign.  (B-)

Zan Hecht:  Great first act, it had me laughing out loud several times.  The
   second act slowed down a bit, and wasn't really funny until the final gag
   (which I can't remember right now, but I laughed out loud at the time).
   The third act was just unfunny, but still entertaining.  There were a
   couple of scenes that didn't seem to fit, such as the scene with Bart and
   the bullies and the scene on the trailers where Homer finds the dog, but
   other than that, nothing this week was objectionable.  Considering that
   this was Al Jean's first attempt at producing in quite some time, I have
   high hopes for the future of the season.  (B+)

Darrel Jones:  Loved it.  All the gags fell into place, like the hooch bit and
   the Noid.  Burns was his usual semi-competent evil self.  While it was
   rather similar to [3F03], that doesn't bother me because it's the ep that
   got me interested in the show, and Lisa wasn't nearly as self-righteous
   this time.  A well-deserved 10/10.  (A+)

Yours Truly:  "She of Little Faith" is a thought provoking show -- until it
   actually begins.  The root problem might lie in the pacing.  The setup is
   funny, but takes so long that by the time we get to Lisa's conversion, the
   show has only enough time to explore it in a rushed and shallow fashion.
   The rocket subplot probably should have been a show unto itself.  On the
   other hand, Homer comes off nicely here.  Richard Gere has some good lines,
   but it would have been better if he had played a role, rather than himself.
   A promising episode, but ultimately it isn't "Simpsons" Nirvana.  (C+)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B (3.02)   Std Dev.: 0.6596   (9 reviews computed)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Timing is everything

According to a caption, the rocket is delivered in six to eight weeks.  Don
   Del Grande figures that's about right:  It was 6 to 8 weeks until the
   rocket arrived, and then another 3 weeks for the church to be built, so
   that's 11 weeks, plus the time from when Lisa left until Christmas Eve, so
   it [the delivery time frame] is possible.


Jim DiDomenico agrees:  Remember that this year, the World Series didn't end
   this year until early November, about 8 weeks before Christmas.  (It was
   pushed back 1 week by the 9/11 attacks; this is the first time baseball has
   gone into November).  Add the 3 weeks and at least another week of Lisa
   being Buddhist and it's late-September regular season games.


>> Old references never die

Alex Cain thought the Noid reference passed its sell-by date:  Domino's
   stopped that particular ad campaign and icon around 1990 or so.  Ten years
   is a little too much, even for "The Simpsons."


Aaron Hirshberg responds:  And that's why they also satirized 50s style Sci-Fi
   movies, which are 40-50 years old.  And Mrs. Hamster was dressed like
   Jackie Kennedy was on 11/22/63 [That's November 22, for people who put the
   day first in dates], the day JFK was assassinated, 38 years ago.


Bucky Jones adds:  I got it, you got it, everyone else in here got it ...
   what's the problem?  Marge used it as a reference in a previous episode ...
   should we feel bad if someone's too clueless to get the reference?  Should
   we cater to the ignorant?  Should they have used Domino's newer, lamer, and
   more unrecognizable mascot Andy?


Frederick J. Barnett:  Not only did I remember the Noid, I STILL have one of
   those Noid toys with the suction cups on the hands for hanging in a car
   window!  I always loved the little guy, even though I can't stand pizza
   (maybe that was why?), and loved the reference.


Matt Garvey:  I like the more obscure references anyway.


Kevin Madden notes:  The Noid would be in desperate need of work right about
   now.


>> Buddhism:  The religion of superstars!

Benjamin Robinson writes:  Tired of the hypocrisy, corruption, one-upmanship,
   and constant panhandling found in most Western religions?  Well, my friend,
   Buddhism may be the answer for you!  At least, it was the answer for a lot
   of disaffected young Americans searching for spiritual enlightenment.

   Enlightenment, of course, is what Buddhism is all about.  It dates back to
   the sixth century BCE when its founder, Siddhartha Gautama, had a
   revelation:  The best way to achieve inner peace was to practice a program
   of meditation, kindness towards others, and personal modesty.  By not
   giving in to mundane earthly desires like lust, materialism, and BMW
   ownership, Buddhists strive to reach Nirvana, a moment when you reach
   perfect spiritual knowledge.  (I think.  Nirvana has always sounded
   vaguely-defined to me, perhaps because words *can't* describe it very
   well.)  There's more, a lot more, to the religion.  If you want to hear it
   from people who actually know what they're talking about, you could try
   some of the newsgroups dedicated to it like <alt.religion.buddhism> and its
   subgroups, <uk.religion.buddhism>, or <talk.religion.buddhism>.

   Buddhism's back-to-basics concentration on the spirit has gained it
   followers here in the West.  Some converts drop their old religion
   entirely, and practice Buddhism in the same way people in the religion's
   traditional home territory do.  Other people don't really convert, but
   adapt what they see as the best aspects of Buddhism into their own
   religion.  Some, like Lisa, take a compromise approach. They are primarily
   Buddhists, but participate in other religions as well.  (Evidently, you're
   allowed to do this, since religion in Asia is generally a non-exclusive
   thing.)

   Richard Gere, by the way, probably is the most famous *American* Buddhist.
   Like Lisa, he's an idealist; the kind of guy who might use an awards
   ceremony to drum up support for a free Tibet, or a fund- raiser to push for
   peace between America and Afghanistan.  What he's doing in Springfield is
   anyone's guess.  Perhaps the universe arranged for him to be there to show
   Lisa the way.


Gert Wallage, practicing Buddhist, writes:  First of all, "the Springfield
   Buddhist Temple" was an interesting hodge-podge of items you'd be unlikely
   to find in any single temple anywhere ... which arguably makes it
   "generic," I suppose.

   The temple exterior is (more or less) traditional Chinese.

   The rock garden that Richard Gere is tending is Japanese Zen.
   (Incidentally, in real life you usually find rock gardens *outside* the
   temple!)  Is it possible that this is a veiled reference to Gere's initial
   interest in Japanese Zen, which he practiced for several years before
   discovering, and committing to, Tibetan Buddhism?  Er, probably not ...

   The "laughing Buddha" at the front of the temple is a Chinese figure known
   as Pu-tai, popularly regarded as an incarnation of Maitreya, the Buddha to
   come.  Chinese Buddhists sometimes view him as a god of good luck and
   prosperity.  Now, you wouldn't normally see one in the place of honour in
   the centre of the temple's main shrine; this spot is usually reserved for a
   statue of THE Buddha, namely the historical Sakyamuni Buddha.  So that was
   actually a little odd.  (One reason why my husband and I *especially*
   enjoyed the line "Who's the Buddha?")

   "Om mani padme hum" is the most famous Buddhist mantra -- the mantra of
   compassion.  Interestingly, aside from Richard Gere and the reference to
   the Dalai Lama, this was the only Tibetan Buddhist element to appear in the
   episode.

   *Something* (not sure what) was shown at the back of the temple, next to
   the door.  Gotta say, if it was meant to be a stepped table full of votive
   candles, 'twas more Catholic than Buddhist.

   And on the plus side:

   1 - The thumbnail summary of Buddhist tenets was actually pretty good. Less
   toe-curling than that "King of the Hill" episode, for sure.

   2 - I never thought I'd hear either of these phrases on a Simpsons episode,
   but there they were:  "All things are empty of inherent existence" and
   "Free Tibet!"

   Frankly, I was surprised that FOX went along with that second line ...
   until I realized that Richard Gere probably wouldn't have agreed to appear
   on the show unless it included an explicit reference to the Chinese
   occupation of Tibet.  [Greg Bair replies, "I don't think FOX really cares
   what is said on the show as long as it's within decency limits.  FOX has
   never really censored stuff on political reasons, although they have been
   with some stuff lately" -- Ed.]

   3 - And again we hear the very important question, "Who wears short
   shorts?"  I'm going to add that mantra to MY daily practice ...


>> Not Lenny!

Alex Foley writes:  Richard Gere's comments about wanting to kick Lenny's Ass
   was humorous considering recent events.  Gere made some news lately when he
   said that we should not attack the Taliban ... rather we should understand
   them and give them a hug instead.  Needless to say this didn't go over too
   well with a lot of people, particularly in New York.  When Gere appeared at
   the concert for New York he was roundly booed and many people shouted "You
   Suck!" at him.


>> Behind the Scenes

Capt. Cocoran writes:  As befits a guy who's been with the show from the
   beginning, Al Jean clearly likes previous-episode references.  All the
   banners for businesses that have appeared in previous episodes; the return
   of the Hamster from "Duffless."


Greg Bair reminds us:  I would like to remind you people that this was NOT the
   first Al Jean episode made.  The first will be DABF01, "Brawl in the
   Family", which has not yet aired.


James Gennero:  Ok, but it ["She of Little Faith"] was the first one to air.


Capt. Cocoran continues:  For the first time since season five, George Meyer
   is not working full-time on the show.  Now he's billed as "producer," which
   this season means someone who is only a part-time staffer (other people who
   have the new "producer" credit include Mike Reiss and Jon Vitti).

   Two of the new writers, Josh Lieb and Brian Kelley, are former staff
   writers for "NewsRadio" (once a forgotten sitcom on NBC, now popular in
   reruns on A&E).  Lieb even got to run that show in its last (and least)
   season after Phil Hartman died.

   David Silverman, one of the show's original directors and the animation
   producer from seasons 3 to 9, has returned to the show starting with this
   week's episode.


>> Yeah, I'm Complaining About This Again

Alex Foley complains:  Well once again FOX squeezed out the credits when
   something out of the norm was going on (In this case an alternate version
   of the theme song).  This time it was to promote "24", a show Fox seems to
   spend 24/7 promoting already.  Trust me, there is maybe 1 guy in Idaho who
   still isn't aware of "24", yet FOX feels we got to hear about it AGAIN.  I
   don't know if this is nationwide or just my local affiliate, but I find
   this very annoying.  Of course this won't change, since this is a practice
   all the networks like to do, but it still pisses me off all the same.


Benjamin Robinson:  It used to be that if something special was airing during
   the credits, Fox would leave them alone.  Alas, this no longer appears to
   be the case.


[Since then, Fox has left the credits alone for some jokes.  (For example,
   Homer's "What Do I think of the Pie" song in "Special Edna (EABF02).")  I
   don't know how the network decides this, though.  Maybe they have a monkey
   throw darts, or something?  -- Ed.]

> Quotes and Scene Summary  {bjr}
==============================================================================
% Bart and Lisa pass the time by watching "The Planet From Outer
% Space," a science-fiction movie that was either filmed in the 50s,
% or by someone with a very acute sense of retro filmmaking.  The word
% "science" is loosely applied here.  When the ship's hull is
% breached, "space air" rushes in and gags the astronauts until they
% put on goggles which allow them to breathe freely.  The captain
% lights up a cigarette, then gasps when a "monster from space"
% threatens the ship.  Bart and Lisa aren't fooled for a second.  They
% see that the "monster" is really a dog in a harness and fishbowl
% "space helmet."
%
% And now for a word from our sponsor.  A man in his late 50s or early
% 60 addresses the camera.

Colonel:	Hi.  I'm Colonel Chet Manners, five-time space 
		shuttle alternate.
Bart:		[offscreen] Loser!
Colonel:	Would you like to boldly go where people like me but 
		not me have gone before?  [holds up a model rocket 
		kit] Then get the Orbit King, with yaw control like 
		you've never seen.
		[cut back to the Simpsons' TV room]
Bart:		Hey, Lis, is Dad's credit card number 
		5784365343410709?
Lisa:		You know it is.
-- Bart Simpson, identity thief, "She of Little Faith"

% Six to eight weeks later, Homer is in the bathroom, flossing to the
% tune of Devo's "Whip It."

When you have a rib-eye steak,
    You must floss it.
Oh, that meatloaf tasted great.
    You must floss it!
Now, floss it!  Floss it good!
-- Homer Simpson, "She of Little Faith"

% Bart walks up with his new model kit, and asks Homer if he wants to
% help.  He does, so he joins Bart and Milhouse in the back yard and
% helps them glue the pieces of rocket together.

Milhouse:	I didn't know your dad was so interested in science.
Homer:		Science!?
Bart:		Uh, he didn't say, "science."  He said, "pie pants."
Homer:		Mmmm, pie pants.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% The rocket is soon ready to launch, and Homer begins his countdown. 
% Before he can reach T-0, the rocket explodes.  The shock of the
% explosion blasts the eyebrows off Milhouse's forehead and onto
% Bart's cheeks.
%
% Undaunted by failure, Homer and the boys try again.  Homer duct-
% tapes a new rocket to the launch pad.

Homer:		The word "un-blow-up-able" is thrown around a lot 
		these days, but I think I can say with confidence 
		...
		[boom!]
		Okay, that shows you what could potentially happen.
		[just then, a model rocket launches from the other 
		side of the backyard fence]
		What was that?
Ned:		[looking over the fence] Greetings from Neddidy 
		Space Center on Cape Flandaveral.  We noticed your 
		sky-ro-technics and thought we'd join in.  [looks 
		up] Ooh, looks like a perfect landing.
		[the Flanders's rocket not only lands gently, but it 
		lands in its original box and neatly closes the 
		flaps behind it]
Milhouse:	Wow!  Did you see that yaw control?
Homer:		I have eyes, don't I?
-- "She of Little Faith"

% This time, Homer calls in the big guns -- the nerds he met when he
% attended Springfield University.  They assemble an impressive scale
% model of the Saturn V moon rocket.

Homer:	I would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.
Gary:	Well, then could you stop calling us nerds?
Homer:	Dweeb, wonk, spaz -- it's all good.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% The nerds finish the rocket.  For their troubles, Homer shoos them
% (Milhouse, too) of his property.
%
% Just as the real space program sent up chimpanzees as its first
% "astronaut," Homer and Bart's rocket will launch an animal into the
% skies.  There being no chimps handy, the rocket will carry Nibbles
% the hamster.  The hamster, in a spacesuit, says goodbye to a female
% hamster dressed in a tiny copy of Jackie Kennedy's pink outfit.

Marge:	Oh, he's leaving her with five babies.
Bart:	She already ate three.
Marge:	Oh.  That's sensible.
-- Pity she didn't think of it sooner, "She of Little Faith"

% As majestic music plays, the hamster-astronaut rides up the gantry
% to the space capsule.

Son, we are about the break the surly bonds of gravity, and punch the 
face of God.
-- Homer Simpson, "She of Little Faith"

% This time, the launch is perfect (if you forgive Homer counting
% down, "five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... countdown!"). 
% The rocket launches with such force that it stretches the hamster's
% features back, exposing his teeth.  It traces a graceful white arc
% across the blue sky, inspiring one man to give up drinking, and
% another man to start.
%
% The rocket begins to drift off course.  Homer tries to radio a set
% of complicated directions to Nibbles.  The hamster looks briefly at
% the control panel, sees the red eject button, and quickly gets a
% better idea.  He head-butts the button, and ejects to safety.
%
% The unmanned rocket heads for the church.  Homer goes to his backup
% plan:  He pulls out a shotgun and fires wildly at the rocket.  He
% misses, and the rocket crashes into the church, ricocheting around
% and causing havoc before bouncing out and landing in the front lawn. 
% The flames and smoke are visible from the Simpsons' back yard.

Marge:	This is the worst thing you've ever done!
Homer:	You say that so much it's lost all meaning.
-- Worst nagging ever, "She of Little Faith"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  5:42]
%
% The church council -- Marge, Ned, Kearney, Jasper, Mrs. Skinner, and
% the Lovejoys -- convene in the shadow of the ruined church and try
% to figure out how to afford the repairs.

Marge:		Fixing all that damage is going to be very 
		expensive.
Lovejoy:	Yes, barring some sort of miracle.  [looks 
		Heavenward, expectantly.  Nothing happens] All 
		right, we'll help ourselves -- yet again.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% The meeting continues.

Lovejoy:	People, we need some fund-raising ideas.
Marge:		Let's just write to David Bowie again.
Lovejoy:	No, he's done enough for this church.  Anyone else?
		[a sinister chord is heard, and the shadow of a 
		horned being falls across the council.  The camera 
		pans to reveal that it's Mr. Burns, with the "horns" 
		being twin cowlicks of hair]
Burns:		[he smoothes down his hair and approaches the group]  
		I've got the answer.  Let me run this church like a 
		business.
Ned:		It's kind of you to offer, Mr. Burns, but the buzz 
		around town is that you're, well, evil.
Burns:		Oh, that's just a skip-rope rhyme.  Believe me, the 
		Lord's going to go for this in a big way.  Now, 
		who's with me?
Lovejoy:	Oh, I guess we have no choice.
Burns:		Excellent.  [a crucifix falls off the church and 
		smites Burns on the head]
		[looking up and shakes his fist] Oh, you'll get 
		yours.
-- Vengeance is mine, saith the Burns, "She of Little Faith"

% Mr. Burns introduces the church council to Lindsey Naegle, the
% consultant he has hired to oversee the church's renovation.

Naegle:		I guarantee I can find some new revenue streams.  
		Step one:  Let's sell some ad space.  Reverend, how 
		would you feel about wearing this robe?  [holds up a 
		robe with "Fatso's Hash House" embroidered on it]
Lovejoy:	Mmm ... conflicted?
Burns:		Too bad!  You've already signed the deal.
Naegle:		Actually, he hasn't.
Burns:		Oh.  Well, we highly value your input.  [menacing] 
		Until you sign the deal.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% In spite of Rev. Lovejoy's misgivings, Naegle and Burns continue to
% remake the church in their image.  Workers carry advertising signs
% and a Lard Lad statue inside the church as Bart and Lisa watch.

Lisa:	What are they doing to the church?
Naegle:	We're rebranding it.  The old church was skewing pious.  
	We prefer a faith-based emporium teeming with impulse buy 
	items.
Lisa:	I feel like I want to throw up.
Naegle:	Then my work is done.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% And three weeks later, Ms. Naegle's work truly is done.  I giant
% neon statue of Jesus as a lasso-swinging cowboy beckons the faithful
% to services.  Inside, the faithful behold a multitude of advertising
% signs, placards, and billboards.  The impulse buy items Lindsey
% mentioned are there, too, including an in-house money changer. 
% ("Get your money changed right here in the temple," says the
% vendor.)  Bart has his picture taken in a one of those novelty photo
% backgrounds where you stick your head through a cutout to make it
% appear as though you are somewhere else.  In keeping with the church
% scene, the background is Da Vinci's "The Last Supper," with the
% cutout where Jesus' face would be.  Marge insists that Bart do at
% least one smiling photo to send to grandma.
%
% The Simpsons settle into the extra-wide seats, which resemble the
% first-class chairs on an airliner.  Lisa resolves not to be taken in
% by the glitz, but Marge is more concerned that Lisa's on the "God
% Cam" Jumbotron.  Whoever is running the camera has superimposed
% "Pouting Thomas" in Lisa's image.  The other parishioners think it's
% adorable.
%
% Rev. Lovejoy is still there, conducting services as he has always
% done.  Well, maybe not as he has always done them ...

Lovejoy:	And Lord, please remember our infirm parishioners, 
		especially Mrs. Glick, who's recovering from hip 
		surgery.  And now let us rise and, um, umm ...
		[pull back into a control room.  Burns and Naegle 
		look at Lovejoy on a monitor]
Naegle:		He's not going to say it.
Burns:		Trust me, he'll say it, or I'll bust him down to 
		Thursday night vespers.
Lovejoy:	... and thank Crazy Larry, whose big-screen TV 
		prices are insane-ane-ane!  [chuckles weakly]
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Rev. Lovejoy introduces pizza mascot The Noid, who will deliver a
% special sermon on "deliciousness."

Lisa:		That's it!
Homer:		[whispering] Quiet, Lisa!  Everyone in the store is 
		looking at you.
Lisa:		They should take a good look at themselves, and what 
		their church has become.
		[the congregation gasps]
Lovejoy:	Lisa, it's still the same basic message -- we've 
		just dressed it up a little.
Lisa:		Like the Whore of Babylon?
		[the congregation gasps]
Lovejoy:	That is a false analogy!
Lisa:		No, it's not.  It's apt.  Apt!  [more gasping] Don't 
		you see what Mr. Burns has done to this church?
Mel:		He restored it from nave to narthex!
CBG:		He super-sized the pews for the zaftig believer.
Patty:		He put ice in the urinals.
Lisa:		Those are all wonderful things, but they cost the 
		church its soul.  I for one will not be a part of 
		it.
		[gets up and walks out]
Usher:		Do you want your hand stamped so you can come back 
		in?
Lisa:		No.  I'm leaving this church forever!
		[leaves and closes the door behind her]
Marge:		Oh, no!
Homer:		I don't know how to feel.
Marge:		You should be very upset.
Homer:		Got it.  [anguished wail]  How was that?
Marge:		A little much.
Homer:		[softer cry]
-- "She of Little Faith"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  10:27]
%
% Lisa says her bedtime prayers.

Lisa:	Lord, I'm not turning my back on you.  I just need to find 
	a temple that's free of corruption.
	[Marge is hiding on the other side of the bed]
Marge:	[spectral] Why do you have to be so different?  Always 
	making a big deal out of everything?  [ghostly moan]
Lisa:	Mom, I know it's you.  I can't believe you're 
	eavesdropping on my prayers.
Marge:	[Marge sits up] Oh, honey, I'm worried about your soul.  I 
	want at least one person from this family to go to Heaven.
Lisa:	I still believe in God.  I just think there's another path 
	to Him -- or Her.
Marge:	Her?!  [holds Lisa and looks up] She's just kidding, Mr. 
	Lord!
-- Marge the fundamentalist, "She of Little Faith"

% Thus begins Lisa's spiritual quest.  She studies a few books of
% comparative theology, like "Zagat's Guide to World Religions."  Bart
% stops by her room.

Bart:	Still looking for a new faith?
Lisa:	Yep.
Bart:	Hey, how about one of those religions where you eat a 
	human heart?
Lisa:	No.
Bart:	How about Methodist?
Lisa:	NO!  Look, I'm not just going to pick a religion that 
	seems cool.  I'm going to pick one that's right for me.
Bart:	How about Judaism?  When you turn thirteen, cha-ching!
Lisa:	I'm going out for a walk.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Lisa's walk takes her past the temples of many faiths.  Finally, she
% arrives at Springfield's Buddhist temple.  Intrigued, she goes in. 
% Lenny and Carl are there, meditating.

Lisa:	Lenny and Carl?  You guys are Buddhist?
Carl:	Oh, yeah.  If I didn't have inner peace, I'd go completely 
	psycho on all you guys all the time.
Lisa:	Well, I'm looking for a new faith, one that isn't so 
	materialistic.
Gere:	Well, you've come to the right place.  Buddhism teaches 
	that suffering is caused by desire.
Lisa:	[gasps] Richard Gere?
Lenny:	Ooh!  The world's most famous Buddhist.
Gere:	Well, what about the Dalai Lama?
Carl:	You know, the fourteen incarnation of the Buddha 
	Avalokesvara.
Lenny:	Who's Buddha?
Gere:	It's a good thing Buddha teaches freedom from desire, 
	'cause I've got the desire to kick your ass.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Lisa says she's looking for a religion that will bring her inner
% peace, so Mr. Gere gives her a pamphlet that introduces her to the
% religion's central teachings.  Turning to more earthly concerns,
% Carl asks Gere if he really did all those sit-ups in "Officer and a
% Gentleman."  Nope -- they just looped the film of Gere's one sit-up.
%
% Back at home, Lisa looks at the Buddhist pamphlet, which explains
% that good actions lead to happiness, while evil actions bring on
% unhappiness.  Instead of emphasizing creator-gods, Buddhism stresses
% the search for enlightenment.  That's enough for Lisa.  She opens
% her bedroom window and shouts to the world, "I'm a Buddhist!"  Her
% yell startles a flock of birds out if its tree.  The Flanderses can
% hear it next door.

Lisa:	[offscreen] Hey, I'm a Buddhist!
Ned:	[gasp] My Satan sense is tingling!  Into the root cellar, 
	boys!
Todd:	When can we come out?
Ned:	Maybe never.
Rodd +
 Todd:	Yay!
	[they all go to the cellar, closing a heavy steel door 
	behind them]
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Breakfast time.

Homer:	So, you think you know better than this family, huh?  
	Well, as long as your in my house, you'll do what I do, 
	and believe what I believe.  [the camera pans to reveal 
	that Homer is talking to Bart] So butter your bacon!
Bart:	Yes, father.  [does so]
Lisa:	Mom, Dad, my spiritual quest is over.
Homer:	Hold that thought.  [to Bart] Bacon up that sausage, boy.
Bart:	Dad, my heart hurts.  [Homer glares at him] Ohh.  [wraps a 
	slice of bacon around a sausage link and eats it]
Lisa:	I'm a Buddhist!
Homer:	What?  That's it -- no more chat rooms for you!
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Marge tries to bribe Lisa back to Christianity with dessert, but
% Lisa has already overcome her desire for treats.
%
% Lisa's conversion has some fallout at school.

Jimbo:		Hey, Simpson, I hear your sister dumped 
		Christianity.
Bart:		Who cares?
Dolph:		I'll tell you someone who cares.  He's got long 
		hair, works as a carpenter, has a lot of crazy ideas 
		about love and brotherhood.
Jimbo:		His name's Gunnar and he's dating my mom.  Sometimes 
		he buys us beer.
Bart:		I thought Kearney was dating your mom.
Kearney:	Hey -- *she* came on to *me*.
Jimbo:		Get him!  [the bullies attack Kearney.  Bart waits a 
		moment, and then joins in]
-- What would Gunnar do?  "She of Little Faith"

% Lisa plants a small tree in the back yard.

Marge:	Hey, Lisa, what are you doing?
Lisa:	I'm planting my own bodhi tree.  If I meditate under it, 
	perhaps I can find inner peace.
Marge:	Honey, is this about some boy at school who doesn't like 
	you?
Lisa:	No!
Marge:	Good.  I'm just saying that any boy who doesn't like you 
	is not worth your time.
Lisa:	[begins to meditate] Om mani padme hum.  Om mani padme 
	hum.  Om mani padme hum.
Marge:	Oh -- you're going to get a bath tonight.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% At the church, Burns announces that church revenues are up 1,073% --
% and that he's keeping the money for himself.  He tosses a smoke bomb
% on the floor, but the smoke clears before Burns can make his escape. 
% Disgusted, he throws the money on the council's table and leaves. 
% The council takes up other matters.

Lovejoy:	Well, next on our agenda:  Marge Simpson's devil 
		daughter.
Marge:		She's not a devil.  I just don't know what to do.
Ned:		Well, Christmas is coming, huh?
Lovejoy:	Yeah, and Santa doesn't leave presents under the 
		bodhi tree.  [winks and taps his nose]
Marge:		You think we can bribe her back with Christmas?
Lovejoy:	[holds up a Bible] Marge you can save more souls 
		with roller skates and Easy-Bake ovens than with 
		this two thousand page sleeping pill.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% And so begins "Operation X-Mas Remind of How Good Is."  Marge
% dispatches Homer to place a Christmas angel on Lisa's bodhi tree. 
% At first she doesn't mind, since the angel is tastefully designed --
% but that's before Homer flips a switch that causes it to bark to the
% tune of "Jingle Bells."
%
% Next Marge makes some Christmas cookies to tempt Lisa, and then
% tosses them out since Lisa's no longer a Christian.  Bart walks into
% the kitchen, notices the trash cookies, and wolfs them down right
% out of the garbage can.  He gags on something and tells Marge, "Uh,
% oh, I think I ate a dog food lid."
%
% Marge tries even harder to get her daughter back into the fold.  She
% and the family put on their Christmas sweaters, and wait for Lisa to
% come down from her room.

Marge:		Here she comes!  And-a one, and-a two, and-a ...
Family:		[caroling] We wish you a Merry Christmas,
		We wish you a Merry Christmas,
		We wish you a Merry Christmas,
		We wish ...
		[Lisa enters the room]
Marge:		Oh, hello, Lisa.
Lisa:		I just came down for a glass of water.
Marge:		Oh.  Well, you do have a present under the tree.  I 
		guess no one told Santa you were a Buddhist.
Lisa:		Well, Santa can take it back, because I'm not ruled 
		by material desi-- [gasps] Is that a pony?!
		[she indicates what looks like a pony wrapped in 
		paper.  Only the muzzle is exposed]
Homer:		I don't know what Santa left you.  I just know his 
		name is Clip-Clop and he loves sugar.  [feeds a few 
		cubes to the present]
Marge:		Lisa, we love you and we're not trying to put any 
		pressure on you.  [nudges Maggie to Lisa with her 
		foot.  Maggie toddles over and offers Lisa a candy 
		cane]
Lisa:		Aww ...
		[she takes the cane, then sees Rev. Lovejoy peeking 
		through the living-room window]
Lovejoy:	Lick it.  Lick it!
Lisa:		No!  [runs out of the room]
Marge:		Oh, no!  Our daughter's run away on Christmas Eve!
		[the present's wrapping paper tears open.  It's 
		Ralph in the front half of a horse costume]
Ralph:		More sugar, please.
Homer:		Bag's in the kitchen.
Milhouse:	[bursts out of the present's hindquarters] All 
		right!  [runs into the kitchen]
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Lisa runs to the Buddhist temple.  Lenny, Carl, and Richard Gere are
% there.

Lisa:	My family tried to trick me into celebrating Christmas!
Gere:	You know, we are meditating.  [points to a "Meditation in 
	Progress" sign]
Lisa:	Oh, sorry.
Gere:	Oh, that's all right.  I was only about to achieve 
	enlightenment, but who'd want that?
Lenny:	[trancelike] Who likes short shorts?
Carl:	[trancelike] I like short shorts.
Gere:	Those guys are way off.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Mr. Gere helps Lisa make peace (inner and outer) with her family.

Gere:	Anyway, Lisa, your family didn't have to trick you.  
	Buddhists respect the diversity of other religions, as 
	long as they're based on love and compassion.
Lisa:	[incredulous] Wha?
Gere:	It's true.  So why don't you go home?  I'm sure your 
	family really misses you.
Lisa:	I can really celebrate Christmas?
Gere:	You can celebrate any holiday.  And, you know, my birthday 
	is August 31st.
Lisa:	Oh, I'll send you an e-mail greeting card.
Gere:	Sweet.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% So Lisa heads back to her family.  Mr. Gere will be spending
% Christmas with Hannah, his daughter, and the two will be doing each
% other's hair.  Lenny and Carl will spend the day with Moe, to keep
% him from "accidentally" killing himself.  (Carl, thinking ahead, has
% already taken Moe's noose.)
%
% The Simpsons search for Lisa.  Sort of.

Homer:	[carrying Santa's Little Helper] I did it!  I found our 
	dog!  Now our Christmas is complete.
Marge:	We were looking for Lisa.
Bart:	I thought we were caroling.
-- "She of Little Faith"

% Marge gives up and decides to call the police.  As she reaches for 
% the phone, she notices Lisa sleeping under the Christmas tree.

Marge:	You came back!
Lisa:	Yeah, I wanted to spend Christmas with you guys.
Homer:	So you're back on the winning team?
Lisa:	No, I'm still Buddhist, but I can worship with my family, 
	too.
