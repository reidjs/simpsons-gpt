% B = Bart, L = Lisa, M = Marge
%
% The TV room.  Bart drinks a soda while watching television.  Lisa plays
% with a rabbit doll.  Maggie plays with a rattle.  Marge is ready to go out.

L: Hey, Mom, can we have an advance on our allowances?
M: [snapping on green gloves] No, you can't.
B: Aw, come on, Mom.  We're dead broke.
M: I said no!  And while I'm out shopping, don't get any funny ideas about
   filching cash from the money jar in the kitchen.

% Bart gets funny ideas about filching cash from the money jar in the kitchen.

B: [to himself] Oh yeah, the money jar!
M: Promise me you'll be honest.
L: I promise.
B: [stands and raises his right hand]  I hereby solemnly swear...
M: Okay, bye, be good.  [leaves]

% Bart's eyes ring up dollar signs.  So does Lisa's.  Maggie looks at them
% both, then her eyes also ring up.

% Lisa peeks into the kitchen.  The money jar twinkles.  Lisa's eye view as
% she approaches.  Lisa puts her hand on the jar, then stops.

L: I wonder if this is wrong.

% A Devil-Lisa appears by her right shoulder.

Devil-Lisa:  Go on, Lisa.  Get the money.

% Lisa reaches for the lid.  An Angel-Lisa appears atop the jar.

Angel-Lisa:  Remember your promise, Lisa.

% (*suck*)  Lisa turns around to see Maggie standing in the archway,
% stroking her finger in the ``naughty, naughty'' gesture, and humming
% a matching sound.  Embarrassed, Lisa leaves.
%
% Maggie hops atop a stool and reaches for the jar.  A Devil-Maggie
% and Angel-Maggie appear.  Both have pacifiers.  Devil-Maggie nods,
% but Angel-Maggie shakes her head.  Before Maggie can decide, Bart
% appears.

B: [scolding] Maggie!

% Maggie leaves.  Bart reaches for the jar.  A Devil-Bart appears.

Devil-Bart: Go for it, dude.  Get the moolah!

% Bart reaches for the lid, but an Angel-Bart appears on the lid.

Angel-Bart: That's right, Bart.  Steal the bread, man.

% Bart gleefully opens the lid.  View from inside the jar, as Bart
% and his two alger egos peer inside.

Devil-Bart: What!?
Angel-Bart: That's it!?  A measly buck?

% Bart angrily replaces the lid.

B: [annoyed] Can't even trust your own mother.
