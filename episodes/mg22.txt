> Quotes and scene summary
===============================================================================
% B = Bart, L = Lisa, H = Homer
%
% The family are driving to church.  Homer and Marge in front, the three
% kids in the back (from left to right, Bart, Maggie and Lisa).  Maggie
% sits forward on her seat.

H: You kids better behave in church today.
B: I don't see why <I> have to go, anyway.  I'm a pagan.
H: Bart!
L: I don't want to go to church either.  I'm a pagan, too.
H: Well, you're going to church, so you can like it or love it.

% We hear a tire blow out.  Bart raises his hand.

B: Uh, if I'm not mistaken, Dad, the tire just blew.

% Bart and Lisa clasp their hands and look skyward.
% Maggie sits back in her seat.

B+L: Thank you, Nature!

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:18]
%
% Pan across to see Maggie and Lisa standing by the car, Bart sitting
% on the fender, Marge inside with a concerned expression, and Homer
% struggling with the right front tire.  Lisa waves her arms.

L: What a beautiful paganistic day!  Come on, Maggie, let's dance.
H: [annoyed] Grab that tire iron, boy.
B: We pagans would like to help you Homer, but it's against out beliefs
   to soil our hands with the greasy tools of sin.

% During Bart's speech, we see that Lisa and Maggie are dancing in an
% unusual manner.  Lisa chants incoherently.

H: Lisa, Maggie, knock that nonsense off.

% Maggie falls down from the strain of it all.  The sky darkens.

B: Too late, Dad.

% Bart heads into the car.  It starts to rain.

H: What the hell are you talking about?

% The kids are safely tucked in the car.

B: Pagan rain dance.  Works every time.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:39]
%
% The sky has since cleared.  Lisa, Bart and Maggie have discarded their
% oppressive clothing (except for Maggie's bow) and are clad instead in
% leaves.  They wave their arms.

B+L: Mom, Dad, look!  We're pagans!

% Homer, struggling with the front tire, turns his head.

H: Why those little...

% Homer chases the kids (his suit all tattered), who head into the church.
% The doors close behind them.  Homer bursts in, and we see that the kids
% are seated in the front pew.

L: Ironically enough, Bart, this house of worship has proven to be our
   sanctuary.
B: Yes, but still, my pagan soul yearns to roam free.
L: No problem.  After the sermon we'll make a run for it.
