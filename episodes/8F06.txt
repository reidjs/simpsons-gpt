===============================================================================
    ... Doris Grau provided the voice of Lunch Lady Doris?
        Frank Welker is known for doing animal noises, so he
        most likely did the horse noises and perhaps also the
        ape noises in the 2001 spoof.
    ... the date on the calendar is 7 November, the date of the episode's
        first airing?
    ... Homer was wearing sneakers at work?
    ... Homer's VCR is a Beta!
    ... the adorable pictures of the kids over Homer and Marge's bed?
    ... the Nuclear cooling tower book-ends (seen when Homer asked for a loan)?
    ... the drawing of Bart magnet'ed to the fridge?  Bart's right eye
        is missing, and his mouth is zippered shut.  Brendan Kehoe {bpk}
        challenges us to identify what famous artist this is mimicking.
    ... Apu's girlfriend is Princess Cashmere!
    ... the angels in Homer's slumber were little Homers?

Dave Hall {dh}:
    ... as Homer wrote the reed reminder on his left shoe, there is a `Fix
        this' message over a hole that's probably caused by something
        radioactive?  (Later, Homer reads this reminder from his right shoe.)
    ... Milhouse wasn't wearing a shirt under his one-button jacket?
        (In general, Milhouse also doesn't wear socks.)
    ... when Homer pleads with Jerry, Homer is wearing his watch upside down?
    ... Jimbo, Kerny, and Dolph were sitting in the back row when
        Homer came in to the talent show?
    ... when the camera was panning left to show Homer watching TV, a cat
        can be clearly seen?  Was this Snowball I?
    ... some of the animals were facing towards the back of their cages?
    ... when Homer smashed the car into the support beam, the airbag didn't
        go off?  (Prior to that, he also hit the mailbox and letters
        fell out.)
    ... the circular saw fell on Homer's head blade first!  Homer also left
        the keys in the car.
    ... when Homer and Lisa walk into the sunrise, Lisa seems to be walking
        bow-legged?  (I wonder why?)

===============================================================================
> Mixed reviews
===============================================================================

Stephen C. Miller {scm}:  A really mediocre episode, especially coming on
the tail of last week's primo episode [8f02].  I feel like there is the
Simpsons I know and love, and then there is its evil twin.  The Simpsons I
know and love is really cynical and political and nihilist and so forth.
The evil twin thinks ponies are cute.

Shawn Harrington {sh}:  I completely agree.  What <is> it with this
season's shows, anyway?  Nearly every other one has been loaded with
``sweetness 'n' light''.  Yeesh!  Enough is enough.

Mike Lee {ml2}:  Here I was relieved that the Simpsons have returned to
classic form:  unpredictable scenes, flamboyant humor (Apu in bed), and
bathroom jokes.

David Hyatt {dh2}:  An average episode, i.e., terrific.

Andrew Tannenbaum {trb}:  I found it to be fairly surreal:  Homer heading
toward heaven (in pale blue), Lisa waking up with a pony's head in her bed
(apparently), Lisa blowing her sax solo most heinously (it wasn't her
fault) during the talent show from hell, Lisa mimicking Katherine Hepburn
while riding a pony.  None of this was standard Simpson's fare.

Steve Portigal {sp}:  A great episode, definitely.

Ron Carter {rc}:  I liked the episode (granted, not as good as the 'ween
episode) 'cause it shows you -can- be fuzzy -and- cynical as all get out...
[I believe Ron Carter meant `funny', not `fuzzy'.  But maybe he <did>
mean `fuzzy'... --rjc]

Yours Truly {rjc}:  Another classic not-happy-ending story.  Lisa gets the
one thing she wants most in the whole world, and has to give it up for the
good of her family.  I laughed so hard after the Godfather reference, I
didn't recover until nearly two scenes later.

>> In the videotape of baby Lisa, Homer has a reasonably full head of hair.
But in [8f05], Homer had lost his hair when the photos were taken, which
would be when Bart was about 3 years old (and Lisa about 1 year old).

Moreover, we know [7f11] that Homer doesn't own a camcorder, so how did
they tape Lisa's first steps and her first words?  Dave Hall {dh} points
out that there was no VCR under the TV set, so presumably they borrowed
the camcorder.

>> In the intro, the store to the right of Moe's is an electronics store,
not a music store.

>> There have been three fillies to win the Kentucky Derby.  The first was
in the 1900's, dead long before Seattle Slew came around.  The second was
Genuine Risk in the 1980.  She <could> have been bred to Seattle Slew, but
she never gave birth to a live foal.  The third, Winning Colors, has had one
child, a filly by Mr. Prospector.  Of course, if there <were> such an animal,
$500,000 sounds like a real bargain! {swm}

>> Andy Peed {abp} points out that ``that stunning creature over there''
could not have been a pony.  A pony is a maximum of 14.5 hands (4 feet, 10
inches) at the withers.  Anything taller is a horse.

Note, however, that the horse trainer never called it a pony.

>> Miscellaneous

Dave Hall {dh}:

Homer's calendar depicts the year is either being 1987, or 1992 (or
other?). (There is no such thing is Sunday, Nov. 21st for these years.)

For one scene, Moe didn't have the towel in the glass, only his hand.

In Marge's mind's-eye, the car seems to be jacked-up at the back.  The
back is raised more than the front where the flat is.  [Maybe Homer was so
stupid, he jacked up the wrong end? --rjc]

Although you hear the audience clapping, you don't actually see them
clapping. (Note the man in the audience seems to have half his head
removed.)

Homer's shirt pocket exists only for the purpose of putting the
postdated check in it.  It doesn't exist before or afterwards.

While in bed, Princess didn't have on her reins, yet, when Lisa was riding
her, she did have it on.

Homer's right thumb seems to be attached to his left hand when he was
holding up the ticket to Apu. (See for yourself!)

Homer's coin seems to have disappeared after he used it to scratch the
ticket.

An FF on Homer stealing the beef jerky doesn't actually show Homer's hand
in the glass jar.

Intro shot of Homer sleeping at the plant depicts him to be wearing shoes
rather then the sneakers that are seen later on.  (You can see the heels.)

Johnny Carson's pants seem to blend in with the floor.

Although the TV room and what Bart said, it suppose to be late, yet if you
look out the bay window, you still see light (daylight scene).

When Homer left for his 8 hour walk, he left out the back door, yet, next
scene show him in the car... which is in the garage?

The window glass at the Kwik-E-Mart didn't show Homer and Lisa's reflection.

Homer's hat was pink only during Bart's order.

===============================================================================
> Lisa's reed crisis
===============================================================================
Marc Colten {mc} suggests that Lisa could've gotten a replacement reed
from Bleedin' Gums Murphy, who was one of the judges.  Moreover, since
she saw Homer in the audience, she could've asked for a second chance
after replacing her reed.

Brian D. Moore {bdm} and I {rjc} responded...

(1) Bleedin' Gums Murphy plays a tenor sax, whereas Lisa plays a bari.
(2) He probably doesn't carry spare reeds around with him.
(3) Being a much more experienced sax player than Lisa, Murphy probably
    uses reeds much harder than Lisa's 4 1/2.  [Brent M. Lofgren {bml}
    notes, though, that 4 1/2 reeds are pretty darn hard.  Beginners
    use a 1 1/2 (quite soft), working up to a 2 or 3 at the college level.]
(4) Asking Murphy for a reed might be construed as fraternizing with the
    judges.

Though I agree with Marc Colten that it would have been completely in
character for Homer to run down the aisle toward the stage yelling,
``I ... HAVE ... THE ... REED!''  (Indeed, I was expecting him to do
that, possibly stumbling over people's feet on the way.)

David Hyatt {dh2} recalls that at his elementary school, the band
instructor always had an ample supply of extra reeds, bows, strings,
mouthpieces, etc.  [Indeed, I recall that at my grammar school, you
actually bought your reeds FROM the band instructor!  And everybody knows
you always carry spare reeds in your instrument case, just in case.  --rjc]

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> The music

Ron Carter {rc} noted that the music during the ``What man can tame her?''
exchange sounds like `It's a Small World'.  But it's actually an augmentation
of the music that plays when Homer pays his first visit to the horse farm.

>> At the beginning of the 2001 spoof, before the apes are shown, the clouds
   in the sky are spelling out a word.  Loosely, but definitely they are
   spelling out `SMILE'.  Joe Kincaid {jk} can't figure out why.

>> The talent show

Lisa was calling from a pay phone backstage, even though she isn't tall
enough to reach the phone to dial or to put money in. {dh}

>> Was baby Lisa the cutest thing or what?

   Dave Hall {dh} points out that, even when a baby, Lisa had her necklace.

   Brendan Kehoe {bpk} was rather taken with the salt lick scene.

>> The animation

Robert Steven Glickstein (bobg@andrew.cmu.edu) asks:

Did anyone get the impression that the animation was a little bit shoddy?
Leaning towards the Saturday-morning-cartoon look?  There's nothing I can
put my finger on about how the show looked, but it just didn't look the
same.  It affected the way I viewed the characters; they didn't seem like
their normal selves to me.  Something was just ever-so-slightly askew.

Brian Howard {bh} replies:

My wife said the same thing, that everything seemed a bit `off model.'  My
eye isn't so finely tuned as hers, but there were definite problems with
the shape of Homer's head, with Apu's lips (in one scene they get huge as
he's talking, then shrink again), and with lots of characters' eyes.  It's
probably because she quit Klasky-Csupo to marry me just as they started
work on this show, and without her as production coordinator the quality
has gone down the drain....  Actually, it might have to do with the fact
that this was the first show directed by Carlos Baeza.

Homer: I got it all figured out.  By day, it'll roam free around the
       neighborhood, and at night, it'll nestle snugly between the cars
       in our garage.
Lisa:  Dad, no!
Marge: That's illegal!
Homer: That's for the courts to decide!

% Marge spends time with the adding machine and comes to a grim conclusion.

Marge: We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries.

       she doesn't even have!
-- ``Lisa's Pony''

Make up your mind!
-- Homer argues with Marge over ``Lisa's Pony''

% Homer goes into the Kwik-E-Mart muttering, ``Need money.''  He buys a
% ``Scratch-for-Cash'' ticket and scratches off one liberty bell, two
% liberty bells, and pretends to have gotten a third and claims his $10,000
% prize.  ``Please to be removing your thumb,'' asks Apu, and he wrests the
% ticket out of Homer's hands.  The third square was a cherry.

Homer: Oh, I need money.
Apu:   Well, if you need money, you should have at least jammed a gun in my
       ribs, or better yet, you could inquire about my help-wanted sign.
Homer: You're looking for help?
Apu:   Yes, we need someone for the demanding yet high-profile midnight to
       8am shift.
Homer: I'm your man!
Apu:   You're hired.  Oh, how I dreamed the day would come when one of <you>
       would be working for <me>.

Homer: [taking notes]  Badge of honor.
Apu:   Here's a pointer.  Try to take it in the shoulder.
-- Working at the Kwik-E-Mart, ``Lisa's Pony''

Apu:   Now, these hot dogs have been here for three years.  They are

% Homer arrives home at breakfast-time.  (``The perfect crime.'')

Homer: Marge, could we go in the other room?
       I did something last night I'm not proud of, and I don't want
       the kids to hear it.
Bart:  Busted!
Homer: [in the other room, explaining]  I'll work from midnight to eight,
       come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more
       minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to bask in Lisa's love,
       then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy.
Bart:  [at the breakfast table, hears a thud]  Oh my God, she killed him!

% for his purchase on the counter.

Homer, you are asleep at your post!  Now go change the expiration dates
on the dairy products!
-- Apu, ``Lisa's Pony''

% Homer falls asleep in the doorway, the automatic doors opening and closing
% on his head.  He drives home and nods off at the wheel.  When we return
% to reality, we see that the car has driven through a fence, and it
% careens into the Simpsons garage (taking out the mailbox and the storage
% shelf in the garage).  A falling circular saw clonks Homer on the head,
% though it doesn't seem to rouse him from his slumber.  Homer sleepwalks
% into bed, where the alarm goes off nary a second later.

Marge: Homer, how long do you plan to do this?
Homer: I don't know.  How long do horses live?
Marge: Thirty years.
Homer: D'oh!

% At work, Homer mutters, ``Mustn't sleep... Must monitor core.''  But he

% Grumbles Homer, ``Ugh, when is she going to <stop> loving me?''  He goes
% back to sleep.

% Marge tries to wake him.  (``Homer sleep now.'')  The air bag inflates,
% becoming a pillow.  Marge explains that Homer had to take a second job,
% at the Kwik-E-Mart.  (Bart gets a kick out of this.)  Marge tells Lisa
% that she has to make the decision herself to give up the pony.

All the years I've lobbied to be treated like an adult have blown up in
my face.
-- Lisa has to decide the fate of ``Lisa's Pony''

% At the Kwik-E-Mart, Bart orders Homer around, while Lisa watches through
% the glass window and sadly comes to her decision.  She tells the stable
% owner to take care of Princess for her and bids the pony an emotional
% farewell.  Meanwhile, Homer's quality of work has dropped yet again.

Oh, the young man you replaced is rolling over in his grave.
-- Apu, ``Lisa's Pony''

% Lisa tells Homer he doesn't have to work nights any more.
