> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [TV Guide] Close-up recommends this weeks episode BABF07 "Grift of the
   Magi".  "Tim Robbins and Gary Coleman provide guest voices in a riotous
   episode (for there is a riot) spoofing the annual 'must have' Christmas
   toy.  When construction costs owed to Fat Tony (Joe Mantegna) bankrupt
   Springfield Elementary, a private company called the Child Development
   Group takes over.  Its leader, Jim Hope (Robbins) promises a curriculum of
   'less 'ick' and more 'yum'', but his real hope is to mine the kids' minds
   for ideas to create the perfect toy.  When Lisa realizes the truth, she and
   Bart sneak past a security guard (Coleman) and obtain a sample product, a
   doll that seems to do everything -- and that includes destroying the other
   toys."

   [TV Guide Canada] Bart, Lisa  and their pals help a toy magnate (Tim
   Robbins) create the ultimate plaything for the Christmas season Gary
   Coleman and Joe Mantegna also guest-voice.  {hl}

Couch:          A fireman's pole stands next to the couch, along with the
                customary hole in the ceiling.  One by one, the family members
                slide down the pole and run their spot on the couch, except
                Homer.  He gets stuck in the ceiling hole, his legs waggling
                helplessly in mid-air.

> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================

Matthew Anscher:
   ... when in drag, Bart was wearing a Farrah Fawcett-style wig, and Milhouse
       was wearing the black bouffant wig from "Homer's Phobia"?
   ... Ned Flanders apparently no longer uses his RV?
   ... in "The Nice Man Giveth," Bart pronounced hospital as if it were
       spelled "hopsital"?
   ... while his parents don't let him play with anything remotely sharp, the
       school let Ralph Wiggum use a saw for the play?
   ... Bart is seen to be as tall as Gary Coleman, therefore measuring 4'8"?

Kay Carina:
   ... this is the first time we see Burns in a long time?
   ... Gary Coleman is taller than Lisa?
   ... Bart says "Peace out" (someone's catchphrase on ATS)?  [Well, I'm sure
       it's more common than that -- Ed.]

Don Del Grande:
   ... when Bart says "butt-bone" (in the scene before the ramps collapse), he
       does a Bart twitch?
   ... they don't explain how someone with a butt cast goes to the bathroom?
       [Ryan, or maybe Amy, Kearns writes, "Ah, recall the 'viewing window'?"]
   ... Sherri and Terri bring different toys, and wave different hands in
       class (one left, one right)?
   ... Funzo does a Nelson laugh?
   ... they manage to sneak in two Christmas carols?  (Most Christmas episodes
       of most shows have a Christmas carol in them, if for no other reason
       than to show off somebody in the cast singing)

Ben Fonter:
   ... Kirk Van Houten sits alone on the couch, while Luann Van Houten chats
       it up with Mr. Largo?

Joe Green:
   ... the Mexican flag in the "¿Donde Esta Justice?" court?
   ... Homer knows what "semantics" means?

Richard E. Green:
   ... Helen (yay!), Maude and Luanne all made appearances, even though their
       voice actress is now gone?

Darrel Jones:
   ... the radiation news story serves as a convenient excuse as to why there
       is no snow during most of this Christmas episode, unlike past Christmas
       eps?
   ... Sheri and Terri are present at the wheelchair-ramp's inaugural
       ceremony?
   ... although Bart claims he won't do his homework assignment, he brings a
       Krusty doll to school anyway?
   ... "Haw Haw" is written on the clipboard?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Chief Wiggum allows Ralph to use a walkie-talkie near water?

   ... Lindsey Naegle is back, with the same name?
   ... the bread-shoes look like Wonder Bread wraps?
   ... Jim Hope really looks like Tim Robbins?
   ... Nelson is winding the jack-in-the-box backwards?
   ... the power-plant towers are featured quite prominently in the play that
       the students use to win money from Mr. Burns?

John Plasket:
   ... Skinner doesn't say that they're compliant, but that they're "closer
       than ever before?"
   ... Skinner makes a millennium reference?
   ... Mr. Burns's trapdoor seems to defy dimensions?
   ... the Kid First guy initially seems to come off as a Mr. Bergstrom [see
       7F19] clone?
   ... Bart, when talking about the new school system, makes several
       grammatical and pronunciation errors?
   ... Chief Wiggum's second attempt at an Ed Sullivan impression is actually
       pretty good?
   ... the woman working at Kid First, a children's toy company, says "damn"
       in front of Bart and Lisa?
   ... Bart doesn't seem to know what a European voltage converter is?
   ... Homer might have said something intelligent under the narrator?

   ... Fat Tony walks out from behind a VERY narrow tree?
   ... Lunch Lady Doris among the group in front of the school as it is closed
       down?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Milhouse covers his "breast area" when Homer comes into the bedroom?
   ... when Skinner introduces Bart to the crowd at the ramp dedication, Homer
       says something like, "I'm proud of you, boy!"
   ... Nelson tires of holding up the pot?

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Nate Birch:  A pretty darned good episode, the first act was great, and
   started events rolling for the second act in classic Simpsons tradition.  I
   liked that this episode dealt with a contemporary issue as well.  The best
   thing about this episode though was that it was damned funny, the only
   complaint I would have would be the rather odd ending, and I think the
   episode could have done without Gary Coleman too.  The animation was decent
   if not amazing.  (A)

Kay Carina:  This is the best episode of the 11th season yet, and by far, the
   best Christmas special.  The play for Mr. Burns was hilarious, and Nelson
   trying to open the jack-in-the-box and Funzo destroying the Krusty doll had
   me LOL!  Even Homer didn't act too much like a jerk.  (A)

Nathan DeHoff:  Certainly different in spirit from the other three Christmas
   specials, this one focused on wacky gags, without really even attempting
   sentiment.  Still, I think it worked.  I don't mind wackiness as long as
   it's not completely awkward (in fact, I rather like it at times), and this
   episode flowed pretty well.  Sure, the premises were somewhat ridiculous,
   but they were carried through fairly well, and there were some very clever
   moments.  [...] The ending was also well-done, with some nice parodies, as
   well as closure to the school's funding problem.  I'm sure other people
   found plenty of problems with it, and some of them might be quite valid
   criticisms, but I liked it.  (A)

Don Del Grande:  The first two-thirds rate A-minus, but the "hey, let's save
   everybody's Christmas" ending was just too trite, especially after the
   "let's take everything from the Simpson house" ending of "Miracle on
   Evergreen Terrace" (ironically, the ending was probably the best part of
   that one).  (B)

Joe Green:  A good episode centered on the kids for a change, with some really
   good jokes (like Nelson being "challenged" by the jack-in-the box).  Not
   great ... but unlike a lot of OFF episodes these days, it wasn't awful
   either.  (B)

Richard E. Green:  Bah ... they just don't make Simpsons Christmas episodes
   like they used to ... this one left more loose ends than the one from two
   years ago (NOW what happens to the school ... I'm gonna assume that Skinner
   will be in control of it again next week, but how?  And what about all
   those families who find that their children's toys were stolen?)  That
   ending didn't seem to work either ... although the Mr. Burns as Scrooge and
   the Simpsons as the Cratchets proves again that some certain people are
   still reading a.t.s.  Still, there were a couple of funny lines.  Best
   part: the pencil sharpener.  (C)

Carl Johnson:  This the second best Christmas special is also the funniest,
   with a great segment involving Mr. Burns early in act two.  The writing was
   sharp, the story was perfect, Homer didn't even steal the spotlight the way
   he has been wont to do lately.  The ending was heartwarming and amusing at
   the same time, something that hasn't been done in awhile.  I think that a
   good little girl or boy must have written Santa Claus a letter asking for a
   good episode of the Simpsons, a boy or girl so good that Santa gave him or
   her the gift almost a week early. Merry Christmas, Simpsons writers.  And
   congratulations on your tenth anniversary as a prime-time animated sitcom.
   (A-)

Darrel Jones:  Man, this was an excellent episode!  Easily the best Christmas
   ep so far. Chock full of good laughs.  Not so much sentimental stuff, but
   that's no problem.  Gary Coleman's pint-sized cameo was well-done, too.
   9/10  (A)

Joe Klemm:  Finally, a good Xmas episode of the Simpsons that can compete with
   the first episode of the show.  The writers wisely used Gary Coleman's
   talents in the story, and the plot was better than the other two episodes.
   (A)

Andrew Levine:  This episode, despite some horribly missed opportunities for
   gags (How much funnier would it have been if Coleman had gone to Clooney's
   party?) and some gags that didn't work out (We didn't need Lisa reminding
   us of the pronunciation of "irony"!), didn't take any really far-out turns
   of plot as has been the custom of late, and we ended up with some of the
   most subversive satire since "Homer vs. the 18th Amendment."  (I hope I
   wasn't the only one to get the joke that in putting on the "Niceman Cometh"
   play, the school was getting money through underhanded means not unlike the
   toy company's.)  The episode took a turn for the predictable in Act 3,
   which was unfortunate given a briskly paced first act.  (B)

Patrick McGovern:  A fantastic, cruel, and cold episode with nearly no missed
   gags, references, or opportunities.  It just falls a bit short thanks to
   its unending harsh nature and coldness: It's a bit too cynical to truly
   connect.  Still, don't pass this one up -- it's a riot.  (A-)

John Plasket:  Just as the Simpsons have become known for its Treehouse of
   Horror series of Halloween specials, it has recently become a tradition for
   the show to produce a yearly Christmas show.  They all seemed to teach us a
   lesson. "Roasting" showed us that happiness can be found for free at a
   racetrack, "Proud" taught the ills of shoplifting and the perils of growing
   up, and "Miracle" envisioned the evils of opening presents early.  What the
   hell is the lesson here?  Don't order a handicapped ramp from the Mafia?
   Hiring Gary Coleman is potentially dangerous?  The only thing close to a
   lesson is "don't take advantage of children," but it doesn't seem to show
   that well either.  Although, there were many good things about it, and they
   seem to outnumber the bad, so for now, Simpsons writers, I'll forgive 'oo.
   (B)

Abhi Ray:  After a promising start, it looks like this season is already going
   down the tubes.  Grift of the Magi was full of satire, but satire that was
   misguided and obvious.  The idea of a sinister toy company never quite
   clicked with me, especially when it did things that toy companies probably
   never do in reality. Not very funny, and not very interesting.  FWIW
   though, the ending is really well done and saves this episode.  (C+)

Tom Rinschler:  Not too bad, having its share of very funny moments (The play
   in Burns' home was a classic!).  The plot was a bit odd, as the setup for
   the setup took some time to develop.  :)  For the first 1 1/2 acts I
   thought they had put the wrong episode on the air, as it didn't resemble
   either a Christmas story or any of the promos I had seen!  However, the
   plot proceeded logically (for the Simpsons!) and didn't go off on odd
   tangents.  Only the ending seemed a bit strained.  (B+)

Eric Sansoni:  The weakest of all the Christmas episodes, this is a tepid and
   forgettable, if inoffensive entry that ranges from the conventional
   (pre-commercial cliffhangers without irony) to the derivative (evil
   children's entertainment companies with their evil robots and see-through
   mirrors, deep-voiced rushed concluding narration), and doesn't provide one
   real laugh.  All the characters seem more or less likable and familiar, but
   their adventures are watered down.  Gary Coleman's cameo would have been
   better if he didn't pointlessly come back at the end.  Also, the writers
   should realize that satire loses its bite when you accuse the establishment
   of doing things that have never happened and make no sense.  (C+)

Yours Truly:  Although nominally a Christmas special, this episode is really a
   pointed political satire of two convergent trends:  The commercialization
   of both our schools and our holidays.  The first half, where a corporation
   covertly uses the children to design a new toy, is a little better than the
   second, which has to juggle adding the holiday theme, wrapping up the show,
   and introducing the much-hyped appearance by Gary Coleman.  His appearance
   was funny (and shows he's a good sport).  Tim Robbins, Clarence Clemons,
   and Joe Mantegna also contribute good guest performances.  On the while,
   the writers should have concentrated on the school-commercialization issue,
   leaving fad toys for another episode.  As it is, this show might not be as
   hot as old Funzo, but I don't think I'll take it back to exchange it for
   something else.  (B)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Musical Reference

Joe Green:  Bart and Milhouse sing "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" while
   jumping on the bed.  [{ddg} notes that the song also appears on the
   Simpsons' own "The Yellow Album."]


>> "I will not sell my kidney on eBay."

First, some background provide by Joe Klemm:  Originally made for buying and
   selling Pez Dispensers, eBay has become the main online auction page.
   People either sell items online or bid on items that they want.  The
   winning bidder then snail mails the winning bid (plus S&H) to the seller,
   who then send the winner his or her prize.  Obviously, eBay has led to
   people getting major fortune


And now, Andrew Levine explains Bart's blackboard punishment:  The reference
   in Bart's blackboard gag is to a person from Sunrise, Florida who, in late
   August 1999, offered up a human kidney for sale on the online auction house
   eBay.com.  The initial asking price was $25,000; the bidding reached $5.7
   million dollars in one week before eBay pulled the bid, claiming that the
   rules of the auction house forbade the sale of human organs (besides the
   fact that selling human organs violates federal law), and claiming the
   kidney sale was "obviously a joke."


Benjy Shyovitz adds:  I would like to add that people have also tried to sell
   other bodily stuff, such as one guy who sold urine to help people pass drug
   tests.  Sick.


>> Also known as the Ramp-O-Rama Act

Benjamin Robinson:  People who don't use wheelchairs often overlook how
   difficult it can be to get around in one.  For instance, the first floor of
   my apartment building is *one* step above ground level.  Yet, even this
   tiny obstacle can bar access to anyone in a wheelchair.  Sympathizing with
   the plight of handicapped people, Congress passed the Americans with
   Disabilities Act (later than 1975, though -- it was either passed or
   heavily revamped in the 90s).  As is often the case with noble government
   programs, living up to the promise is far more difficult than anyone
   expected.  Not only do obvious things like ramps have to be installed, but
   doorways must be widened, and floor plans rearranged for easier mobility.
   Even the doorknob has to be rethought.  The standard round knob, for
   instance, cannot be turned by someone with limited hand motion.  All these
   changes are expensive, even if you don't hire Fat Tony's construction
   goons.  The ADA, being a national law, is not flexible enough to deal with
   individual building quirks. One news organization notes that a post office
   had to build a ramp to its front door.  Before the ramp, wheelchair users
   had to go in the back, violating an ADA rule that says everyone has to be
   able to go through the front entrance.  (Handicapped people complained that
   being shunted to the back made them feel like second-class citizens.)
   After the ramp was installed, wheelchair users continued to go in the back
   way.  The expensive ramp in front made too sharp a turn, so it was easier
   just to do things the way they had always been done.  Given this, it's no
   wonder Skinner has been dragging his feet on bringing Springfield
   Elementary up to code.


>> They're Venn-tastic!

Benjamin Robinson explains:  You might remember Venn diagrams from grade
   school.  The teacher would draw a circle, representing all the people who,
   say, owned BMWs. Then, the teacher would draw another circle, representing
   the set of people who knew enough to turn their fog lights off when it
   wasn't foggy.  The two circles would intersect, looking a little like the
   MasterCard logo.  The oval area covered by both circles represented the set
   of BMW owners who didn't blind you with their fog lights on a clear day.
   If the two circles didn't cross, it would mean that neither group had any
   common traits, so BMW could save a ton of money on fog light switches.  I
   remember Venn diagrams being taught in fourth grade, meaning that second-
   grader Lisa is once again studying above her grade level.


>> Wishing you a pleasant non-denominational holiday experience, Pt. 1

Benjamin Robinson writes:  The guest roster of Krusty's special included the
   following people.

   Téa Leoni -- When she debuted on Fox's "Flying Blind", critics predicted
   Leoni would be a breakout comic star.  We're still waiting, as Leoni has
   instead gone on to be featured in non-starters like "The Naked Truth."

   Beck -- Eclectic musical artist, who records a lot of intensely sample-
   heavy songs.  Hit it real big recently with the album "Odelay," and had
   some follow-up albums do okay if not spectacular business.  [{sm} adds, "He
   has had one follow album, and it is very recent, and it is far too early to
   say how successful it is."]

   Dixie Chicks -- Country trio.  That's about all I know of them.

   Patrick Ewing -- Famous basketball player.


>> Wishing you a pleasant non-denominational holiday experience, Pt.

Benjamin Robinson, again:  Krusty mentioned several holidays at the end of his
   special.

   Christmas -- Celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, who is obviously the
   focal point of the whole religion.  But you probably already knew that.

   Hanukkah -- Celebrates two things.  First, the miraculous victory of Jewish
   guerilla forces over the Greco-Syrians.  Second, the rededication of the
   Temple in Jerusalem, when one day's supply of oil for the Temple menorah
   lasted the eight days needed to prepare new oil.

   Kwanzaa -- Holiday celebrating African culture and values.  Each day, a
   candle representing a different value (like "community" or "self-
   determination") is lit, and educational toys are given to the children.

   Tet -- Vietnamese New Year, and the major holiday on their calendar. It
   combines solemn and joyous aspects.  In America, associated with the
   notorious "Tet Offensive" in the Vietnam War.

   Ramadan -- Muslim holiday.  Don't hold me to this, but I think it has
   something to do the month leading up to Mohammed's receipt of the Koran
   from Allah.  As Krusty mentions, Ramadan is a solemn holiday; observers
   must fast between sunrise and sunset.

   Krusty, despite being nominally Jewish, acts like a Mammon-worshipper.


>> Without Furby, you're nothing!

Joe Klemm:  Last year, the hottest toy for the Christmas season was Furby.
   Resembling Gizmo from the film Gremlins, Furby was a talking toy that
   communicated with humans It has a mast [?] amount of vocabulary in both
   English and Furbish, and comes in different colors and sizes.


John Plasket adds:  When Furby was introduced, Warner Bros. and/or Amblin
   Entertainment sued Tiger Electronics because it looked too much like the
   character Gizmo, from "Gremlins."  It was announced that a new "facelifted"
   Furby was to be introduced.  When I saw it, I didn't notice much of a
   difference, if any.  It probably had something to do with the fact that a
   couple of months ago, I saw Tiger selling Gizmo as one of "Furby's
   Friends."  Well, money talks, I guess.


>> He'd find more work if he wasn't a few prawns short of a galaxy.

John Jensen notes:  What made the Gary Coleman appearance semi-funny was that
   in real life, he *IS* a security guard.  He made news a few months ago for
   some kind of dispute, but he hasn't acted since God knows when.  [DJ Maniak
   points out he's been on "Shasta McNasty," although that's not much of an
   improvement over staying home -- Ed.]  So to make fun of himself like that
   was quite commendable.


>> "The Biggest Ripoff Since ..."

Matthew Anscher explains:  "Webster" The ABC-TV series, starring 3'4" Emmanuel
   Lewis as a black orphan adopted by a white couple with no experience
   raising children, was similar in so many ways to Coleman's "Diff'rent
   Strokes" on NBC, that critics (and some "Strokes" fans) cried "rip-off,"
   and TV critics, who are never impartial when it comes to "kid-coms,"
   accused it of being too saccharine (few of them liked "Strokes" to begin
   with).  Some even went as far as to accuse both shows of being racist, for
   allegedly insinuating that all blacks needed white people to come to their
   aid. Nonetheless, the series got a 17.2 Nielsen rating in its first season
   (1983-84), putting it in a tie for 25th place with the CBS Tuesday Movie,
   "Alice," "Knight Rider," and "Hardcastle and McCormick."  It ran until 1987
   on ABC, then its producer, Paramount, produced 2 more years worth of
   episodes to pad out its syndication package.  The series has aired on 2
   cable networks (USA and WGN) in recent years.  Two fans of the series are
   eccentric pop star Michael Jackson, who took Lewis to the Grammy awards
   with Brooke Shields in 1984, and Simpsons neighbor Ned Flanders, who wore
   an "I Love Webster" shirt, bearing his likeness, as he welcomed OFF to
   Evergreen Terrace in "Lisa's First Word."


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Xmas Tree of Horror IV


Wilson Banswell reports:  "Grift of the Magi" received a 7.7 rating (12 share)
   for its December 19 airing.


Don Del Grande wonders:  So what happens when everybody wakes up and finds out
   their Funzo dolls are gone -- and they just HAPPENED to be visited by the
   Simpsons the night before?


Benjamin Robinson:  The "coccyx" is the medical name for your tailbone.
   Really.

Milhouse: Who wets their bed now, Milhouse?  [chuckles]
Lisa:     Ugh, I'll be in my room.

% At the hospital, Bart is closely monitored as Dr. Hibbert defibrillates
% Bart's buttocks.

Marge:   Why are you doing that?
Hibbert: Oh, it's good for the batteries.  Now, I'm afraid your son has

         [Lisa, Marge, and Homer laugh]
Marge:   Sorry.  How long will he take to recover?
Hibbert: He'll have to wear this fanny cast for quite some time [he slides it
         on], but don't worry, son, it fits snugly under your clothes.
         [pulls down a chart showing a boy wearing cast.  His butt bulges

Bart:    Do all these people have to watch me?
         [Several people are watching through a window]

% At school, Bart has trouble getting up the front stairs in his wheelchair
% and winds up tipping over.  Lisa comes over to help.

Skinner:  Bart, stop fooling around.
Lisa:     Principal Skinner, I thought public schools were required to have
          access ramps for the disabled.
Skinner:  Technically, yes, but the building costs would be astronomical.
Fat Tony: [emerges from behind a tree] Did I hear the word "astronomical"?  If
          so, my construction outfit "Valdezzo Brothers Olive Oil" is poised
          to help.
Skinner:  No, no, no, no.  We're not building anything.
Fat Tony: How can you say that when construction has already begun?
          [construction workers arrive and start massive construction]
Skinner:  How did those trucks get here so fast?!
Fat Tony: In order to avoid certain legal complications, the trucks are always
          rolling.  Now for the groundbreaking ceremony.
          [Fat Tony and Principal Skinner hold a golden shovel for a picture]
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% After much more construction, complicated cloverleaves of ramps are built
% all around the school building.  Principal Skinner talks to Fat Tony.

Skinner:  Good Lord!  Do we really need all those ramps?!
Fat Tony: Who's to say?  Does a peacock need all those feathers?
Skinner:  Look, you're getting a little philosophical for me.
Fat Tony: I suppose so.  They say it happens in the autumn years.
Skinner:  [leaning against a car] Well, be that as it may--
Fat Tony: Get your hand off my car.
          [Skinner promptly does]
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Finally, it's time for the grand opening of the ramps.  Skinner addresses
% the townspeople who have gathered to witness it.

Skinner:  This is a proud day.  Now when people ask if we're in compliance the
          Americans with Disabilities Act of 1975, I can say, we are closer
          than ever before!
          [Crowd cheers]
          Thank you!  To inaugurate our ramp system, here's the first of what
          I hope will be many disabled students, Bart Simpson!
          [The crowd cheers again as Bart *walks* to the front]
          What the...?  Bart, where's your wheelchair?!
Bart:     Don't need it anymore.  Doctor says my butt bone's stronger than
          ever!  [repeatedly rams his butt into the sidewalk] Ta-da!
          [scattered applause]
Skinner:  Well, at least we're prepared for the new millennium!  [pats a ramp,
          causing the entire system to crumble to the ground; picks up some
          rubble]  My God, the whole thing's made of breadsticks!
          [Seagulls start eating the remains of the ramps]
Fat Tony: And paint and shellac.  It's all itemized in this bill.  [hands
          Skinner an invoice on which is written "Two Hundred G's Thank You!
          Tony :)"]
Skinner:  $200,000?!  Are you mad?!
Fat Tony: I don't get mad; I get stabby.
          [Legs and Louie nod, Skinner grumbles]
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Now Skinner addresses staff and students.

Skinner: The good news is, we no longer need fear viscous mob reprisal...
         [Fat Tony drives by with a sack o' cash; Skinner hangs a "closed"
         sign on the door]
         ...but due to lack of funds, Springfield Elementary is closed
         forever.
         [students cheer]
         Oh, you're cheering now, but someday--

% [End of Act One.  Act Time:  4:43.  Running Time:  4:43]
%
% Springfieldians meet in {Principal Skinner's house} to discuss with him the
% possible courses of action to reopen the school.

Hibbert: How could you close the school?
Marge:   What will become of our kids?
Homer:   Where are the refreshments?
Skinner: Now you keep asking me that, and I keep telling you "over there".
         [At a table some cooks prepare food]
-- "Grift of the Magi"

Skinner: As for the school, we are exploring various options to raise the
         $200,000 we need.
Ned:     I've got a motor home I never use; maybe we should raffle it off.
Homer:   [eating food] Maybe you should shut up.
Ned:     Well, I ... okay.  [sits down]
Moe:     We could try selling liquor; I'm doing great!
Skinner: Please, sir!  Put some shoes on!
Moe:     What, you don't like my bags?  [he's wearing bread bags for shoes]
Skinner: [groan] People, these are all good ideas--
Marge:   No, they're not.  They're terrible, terrible ideas.
Skinner: You're right.  It's hopeless.  No one has that kind of money.
Marge:   What about Mr. Burns?  Maybe *he'll* help us out.
Homer:   [stuffing food in his pants] Forget it.  He releases the hounds on
         every charity that comes to his door -- Feed the Children, Save the
         Whales, even Release the Hounds.
Skinner: Well, maybe we can pry open his wallet with a slick, professional
         pitch.  [snaps finger] A school play!
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Principal Skinner and some students meet at Mr. Burns's mansion to give him
% and Smithers a private screening of their new play, "The Nice Man Giveth".
% First up is Nelson who is mixing soup in a bowl next to cans labeled "salt"
% and "rat poison".

Nelson:  Hmm ... which one of these is the salt?  Too bad I'm an idiot 'cause
         my school closed.  Oh, well.  [pours the poison in the pot]
Burns:   No!!  That's the rat poison!
Skinner: And, freeze!  Now, who in Springfield will eat the poisoned broth?
         Oh-ho! It could be anyone, even Mr. Burns!
Burns:   This play really speaks to me.
         [Next, Bart drives a Mr. Burns dummy around in an ambulance]
Bart:    I can't take Mr. Burns to the ho'pital 'cause I'm too dumb to read a
         map.  Oh, why did my school have to close?
Burns:   Hmm....
         [Bart gets Mr. Burns to the hospital where Ralph, as a doctor, puts
         Mr. Burns on an examination table]
Ralph:   Hello, I'm Dr. Stupid.  I'm going to take out your liver bones.
         [chops Mr. Burns's head off with a saw] Oops, you're dead.
Burns:   I never liked that Dr. Stupid.

% Milhouse, Lisa, and Martin hold up signs saying "Save our school".

Oh, it's doing that *thing* again!
-- Mr. Burns, "Grift of the Magi"

% Still without a school, Bart and Lisa watch "¿Dónde Está Justice?" on TV.

Plaintiff: ¡El Ford Escort que me vendío es un limón!
Defendant: No, no, no, no, no.  No es un limón.  Es un carro fuerte.
Judge:     Hmm, limón ... fuerte ... limón ... fuerte ... limón ...
           ay-yi-yi-yi-yi, ¡mi estómago!
Bart:      Oh, daytime TV is muy estúpido.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Bart changes the channel and finds Kent Brockman in front of Springfield
% Elementary.

Brockman: Springfield Elementary has reopened its doors.
          [Lisa and Bart gasp]
          I'm with Jim Hope of Kid First Industries, which has generously
          stepped in to educate our children.
Jim Hope: That's right, Kent.  You know, when public schools drop the ball,
          it's up to the private sector to fall on that fumble and run for the
          end zone.
Brockman: Will you be replacing the current teachers and administrators?
Jim Hope: Very much so, Kent, but they've already received and extremely
          generous severance package.
Skinner:  [in his house, holding a basket of oranges] Valencia?  [scoffs]
          These are juice oranges!  [throws them to floor]

% The children of Springfield finally return to school.  Jim Hope replaces

        [Class boos]
        You know what?  I agree.
        [Class makes shocked noises]
        Your old school was boring; that's why it failed, right?  Well, we're
        not going to make you memorize facts and dates -- no, no, no -- I'm
        going to find out what you really love in life and teach to that.  [to
        Bart] What are you passionate about, partner?
Bart:   Boogers.
        [Class laughs]
Jim:    [laughing strangely loudly] Boogers!  Ha ha ha ha!  That was great!
        You know, humor is a sign of intelligence.
Bart:   You're not mad?
Jim:    Hey, I'm here to make sure that you get a kick out education.  [kicks
        a book]
        [Class cheers]
Nelson: He's rekindled my love affair with books.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Back at the house, Bart destroys several books by kicking and punching them.

Bart:  Check it out -- I'm kicking books at a sixth-grade level.
Homer: Get 'em, boy!  Hit those smart-ass books!
Marge: Why don't you kick some books, Lisa?
Lisa:  Bart broke all my books.
Bart:  You know what our homework is?  Find a toy and bring it to class.
Marge: Boy, that sounds fun!
Bart:  I know, but I'm still not gonna do it.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Back at the school, Jim Hope's classroom is decorated with Christmas stuff.

Jim Hope: Since Christmas is coming soon, I thought we could talk about our
          favorite toys.  Milhouse, what have you got there?
Milhouse: My Busy Box!  It's got everything!  [turning steering wheel] Vroom!
          Vroom, vroom!  [dialing phone] I'm calling Daddy!
Jim Hope: Good for you, not being bound by the recommended age.
Milhouse: What are you talking about?  [reads "ages 2-4"] Oh, jeez!
Jim Hope: How 'bout the rest of you?  What do you like about those toys of
          yours?
Sherri:   [holding doll] They're special.
Nelson:   They're challenging.  [cranks jack-in-the-box for a while]
Jim Hope: Very good.  Now I want you all to imagine the perfect toy.  What
          would it be like?
Terri:    [holding stuffed animal] It should be soft and cuddly.
Bart:     Yeah, with lots of firepower.
Milhouse: Its eyes should be telescopes!  No, periscopes!  No, microscopes!
          Can you come back to me?
Nelson:   It should be full of surprises.
Milhouse: It should never stop dancing.
Martin:   It should need accessories.

% Meanwhile, on the other side of the chalkboard is a small office is being
% used to spy on the class.  Lindsay Naegle and Phil watch through the
% one-way chalkboard.

Lindsay: Now, that's market research you can take to the bank -- the *money*
         bank.
Phil:    I just wish those second-graders would stop jerking us around.

% Lindsay Naegle and Phil watch through another chalkboard to the class

Ralph:   Fun toys are fun!
Teacher: Well-said, Ralph, but we're trying to come up with a name for a toy.
Janey:   Mrs. Fun?
Teacher: Not bad.
Ralph:   Fun?
Teacher: Ralph, there are no right or wrong answers, but if you don't pipe
         down, I'm giving you an F.
Ralph:   The before-teacher yelled at me, too.
Teacher: No one's yelling; we're just brainstorming names.  Lisa, any ideas?
Lisa:    [puts down book] Oh, a name with fun?  Fungus, Funzo, Attila the Fun.
Teacher: [accusing] Lisa, are you doing math?!
Lisa:    [nervous] Uh, just a few Venn diagrams.
Ralph:   There's more under her chair!
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Lisa is made to stay after school to do the ol' blackboard punishment.  This
% time it's "I will not do math in class".  Bart shows up at the classroom
% door.

Bart: [chuckles] Lisa's in trouble.  Ha!  The ironing is delicious.
Lisa: The word is "irony".
Bart: Huh?
Lisa: Don't you think there's something weird going on here?  We spent all day
      selecting fabric swatches, and then our guest speaker was Phil from
      marketing.
Bart: All's I know is I'm getting straight A's, and that ain't not bad!
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% On the way out of the classroom, Bart switches the light off and cackles.
% Lisa then notices light seeping in from the edge of the chalkboard.  She
% looks through the crack and sees the hidden research office.  In the
% hallway she finds a door labeled "Danger!  Broom Closet".  Inside is the
% secret room.  Lisa looks around and finds notes taken from the days
% discussions in class.  Before she is able to ponder it too much, she hears a
% voice say "I see you!"  Lisa turns around and sees a small robot on a table
% walking towards her and asking for a hug.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Act Time:  6:20.  Running Time: 11:07]
%
% That night, Lisa gets her parents and Chief Wiggum to go to the school to
% see the room and robot.

Wiggum: This better be important, Lisa.  I left Ralphie alone in the bathtub.
Ralph:  [over radio] Daddy, I'm ready to get out now.  Over.
        [They arrive at the "broom closet" door]
Lisa:   This broom closet is not what it seems.  It's a secret surveillance
        room guarded by a tiny evil robot!
Homer:  Ugh.  Is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open
        the door and everything's normal and we think you're crazy, but then
        there really *is* a killer robot and the next morning you find me
        impaled on a weather vane?  Is that what this is, Lisa?!
Marge:  To be fair, not all evil robots are killers.
Lisa:   Listen, when you see what's inside-- [opens the door and a mop falls
        on her head; inside are only normal things you would find in a closet]
        I don't understand; I could swear it was right here!
Wiggum: Yeah, right, mop top, and I'm Ed Sullivan.  [ahem] Really big shoe.
        No, no, I can do it better.  [as Sullivan] Really big shoe -- really
        big.  [normal voice] That's it.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Lisa and Bart watch the Krusty the Klown Show.

Krusty: Well, folks, that's the end of Krusty's nondenominational holiday
        funfest.  I want to thank my guests: Téa Leoni, Beck, The Dixie
        Chicks, ...
Chicks: Merry Christmas, y'all!
Krusty: And Patrick Ewing as the genie.  So, have a merry Christmas, happy
        Chanukah, kwazy Kwanza, a tip-top Tet, and a solemn, dignified
        Ramadan.  Now a word from *my* god: our sponsor.  [bows]

% In Krusty's commercial, a little girl walks down a stairway on Christmas

Anncr: This Christmas, everybody wants Funzo.
Lisa:  "Funzo"?  I said that name in class!
Girl:  Funzo's soft and cuddly.
Boy:   [holding another Funzo which launches a rocket] With lots of firepower!
       [The girl is hit by the rocket, to the boy's amusement]
Funzo: [as Nelson] Ha-ha!

Bart: [yelling] Mom!  I know what I want for Christmas!
Lisa: Bart, they lied to us!  Instead of giving us an education, they tricked

Bart: No, but if you're gonna throw a spas', I'll come with.
Lisa: Good.  Saddle up the bikes.

% And so, Bart goes with Lisa to investigate.  They sneak into Kid First
% Industries' secret headquarters and come across a security guard.  As they

         [Lisa motions for Bart to continue crawling]
Bart:    I want to see how this turns out.
Lisa:    [holding phone cord] The phone's not even plugged in!
Coleman: Alright, you listen to me, Kwan.  Hang on, I got another call.
         [click] Yes, Mr. President!  I can be in Washington right away!
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% In an office room overlooking the production line of Funzos, Lisa and Bart
% find Jim Hope and Lindsay Naegle.

Lisa:   You people took advantage of trusting schoolchildren!
Jim:    How did you get past Gary Coleman?
Bart:   Let's just say he's a few prawns short of a galaxy.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Gary Coleman does Karate moves beside his desk when Lindsay Naegle comes in
% to talk to him.

Lindsay: I'm sorry, Gary.  There's no longer a place for you here.
Coleman: Whatchu talkin' about, Miss Naegle?
Lindsay: That is so adorable!  You're rehired.  [exits]
Coleman: Sucker!  I knew exactly what she was talkin' about.  [sits at his
         desk and sleeps]
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Back in the office room, Lindsay Naegle tries to get Lisa to see the
% situation from their point of view.  Jim Hope reveals that they've been
% under pressure to create the new Christmas fad toy.  He is happy to say that
% Funzo is the first toy "designed by children, for children, with all the
% profits going *to* children".  Lisa is about to be won over until Jim states
% that everyone is someone's child.  To smooth things over, Lindsay offers a
% free Funzo, which Bart promptly accepts.
%
% In the living room, Bart looks through a Funzo accessories book.

Bart:  And I want Funzo's dream fortress, Funzo's lower back pain chair,
       Funzo's European Voltage converter--
Funzo: Why not get three?
Bart:  [gasp] Three it is.  [writes "3" in book, breaking the pencil lead;
       sharpens it in Funzo's ear] Thanks, Funzo.  You rock!
Funzo: Alrighty!  [plays music and dances]
       [Lisa enters]
Bart:  It's always a party with Funzo!
Lisa:  I admit it's kind of cute, but it'll never take the place of Malibu
       Stacey.  [takes out doll]
       [Funzo takes Malibu Stacey, snaps her neck, and throws her body in the
       fireplace]
       [yells] Did you see that?!
Bart:  Yeah!  Funzo makes playtime fun!
       [Funzo walks over to Bart's Krusty doll and strangles it with its pull
       string]
       Hey, why is it destroying other toys?
Lisa:  They must have programmed it to eliminate the competition!
Bart:  You mean like Microsoft?
Lisa:  Exactly.  Come on, Bart, we've got to warn everyone!
       [Funzo dances with the decapitated Stacey and Krusty heads on pencils]
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Outside the Try-N-Save, a crowd of people has gathered waiting for the store
% to open.  Lisa and Bart arrive on bikes.

Lisa:  Boycott Funzo!  He's a toy-killing machine!
Ned:   [chuckles] That shy little imp?
Funzo: [in display window, produces a flower] I have a flower for vous.
Crowd: Aw....
Carl:  Aw, man, I gotta get me one of those.
Lenny: Hey, I'm not waitin' 'til the store opens!  [smashes door window with
       giant candy cane]
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Jim Hope and Lindsay Naegle watch the people running into the store on a
% television from a hot tub.  They use the time elapsed from muttering until
% door smash to calculate a profit of $370 million.  Jim Hope would also like
% to see some trampling, and then they see Moe being trampled.
%
% Lisa is ready to give in to Kid First's evil Christmas Funzomania, but Bart
% gets a plan.  On Christmas Eve at 6 PM, Homer, dressed as Santa, drives Lisa
% and Bart.

Homer: So, who am I beating up?
Lisa:  Nobody.  You're just gonna break into everyone's house and steal their
       favorite toy.
Bart:  Thus saving Christmas.
Homer: [counting on his fingers] Now, let's see ... this'll make three
       Christmases I saved versus eight I ruined ... two were kind of a
       draw...
Lisa:  Dad, Dad!  You're driving on the sidewalk!  [the car lurches, and
       a cat yowls.  Homer steers back onto the road]
Homer: Whoop, sorry.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Bart and Lisa arrive at the first house and ring the doorbell.  Clancy,
% Sarah, and Ralph Wiggum come to the door.  Bart and Lisa sing "Joy to the
% World" as Homer sneaks in the back window of the house and removes the Funzo
% from under the tree.  With the task completed, Bart and Lisa stop singing
% and run to the next house: the Hibberts'.  As they sing "Silent Night",
% Homer's job is complicated by knocking over their Christmas tree and a dog
% who enjoys biting him.  The kids sing louder to cover up the noise.
%
% Finally, they arrive at the Springfield tire fire with a sack of clamoring
% Funzos.  Homer takes the bag out of the car.

Homer: [singing to the tune of "Tiny Bubbles"] Writhing Funzos in my sack,
       makes me happy, makes me hurt my back.
Bart:  Just dump 'em in the fire, Dad.
Lisa:  Yes, the madness ends here.
Homer: Ha!  If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Homer swings the bag of robot dolls around and throws them at the base of
% the tire fire.  The burning Funzos come out of the sack annoyed.  Just then,
% a Kid First Industries Jeep shows up and Gary Coleman gets out.

Coleman: Well, what do we have here?  [takes out nightstick] Looks like the
         biggest rip-off since "Webster".
Homer:   [yells] Please, Mr. Coleman, we can explain!
Coleman: I'm listening.
Lisa:    Your toy company is evil.
Coleman: Well, isn't it possible for an evil company to make people happy?
Lisa:    Are you saying the end justifies the means?
Coleman: That's a very glib interpretation.
Bart:    Hey, don't talk to my sister that way!
Lisa:    No, Bart, he's right; I *did* over simplify.
Homer:   Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics.  I think what
         Lisa *meant* to say is...
Narr.:   And so, Gary Coleman and the Simpsons argued long into the night, and
         then, as day broke, the spirit of the season entered their hearts.
Lisa:    Lets just agree that the commercialization of Christmas is, at best,
         a mixed blessing.
Coleman: Amen.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Then a bare robot Funzo emerges from the fire and Gary Coleman thoroughly
% beats it up.  Bart comments, "Well there's something you don't see every
% Christmas", reminding everyone what day it is.  The Simpsons are about to
% go home when they see Gary Coleman standing all by himself.  Bart whispers
% an idea to Homer, who nods and walks over to Coleman.

Homer:   Um, uh, Mr. Coleman, I've been thinkin', uh, my wife always makes too
         much stuffing and sweet pertaters and all and ... oh, heck, would you
         like to spend Christmas with us?
Coleman: No way.  I'm having Christmas at George Clooney's house.  [adjusts
         tie and hair]
Lisa:    Gary ...
Coleman: Alright, I'll come.
-- "Grift of the Magi"

% Mr. Burns and Smithers join the Simpsons and Gary Coleman in the Simpsons'
% dining room.

Narr.:   And Gary Coleman was as good as his word, and as for old Mr. Burns,
         he was visited by three ghosts during the night and agreed to fund
         the school with some money he found in his tuxedo pants.
         [The Simpsons applaud]
Burns:   Thank you, thank you!  Humbug.
Narr.:   While Moe, seeing what the world would be like if he had never been
         born, pulled his head out of the oven and replaced it with a plump
         Christmas goose.
         [Moe delivers the goose at the Simpsons' table]
Moe:     Yeah, happy holidays, there.
All:     Merry Christmas, Moe!
Moe:     Uh, listen, I kinda banged up that Jeep in the driveway.
Coleman: Whatchu talkin' about, Moe?
         [All laugh, then turn to face the audience]
         Whatchu talkin' 'bout, everyone?
