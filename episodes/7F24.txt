David Hall observes that Maggie spits her pacifier at Bart, yet when Marge
sat her down in the high-chair, she still has it in her mouth.  [That's
because Maggie has a near-infinite supply of pacifiers.  See `The Pacifier'
on the Tracey Ullman Show. --rjc]

===============================================================================
>> The title sequence

J.D. Baldwin {jdb} reports:

In the title sequence, observe that in true cartoon style, the hole in the
wall is a silhouette of our favorite family.  Observe Bart's outstretched
hand, and that Marge's hair takes a chunk out of the picture, which swings
back and forth with the chunk missing.  What kind of hair spray <does> she
use?  We know she has a LOT of it.

Also, freeze-frame on the skinhead's bedroom (early on in the ``Michael
Jackson!?  Michael Jackson?!'' sequence).  In the background are, among
other nifty things:

   a)  a figurine of the devil on his dresser
   b)  a poster of the Grim Reaper holding a chainsaw labeled `DEATH'

>> The Krusty Hotline is 1-909-O-U-KLOWN. {dh}
   But Bart dialed ``0530350''. {cjb}

    Besides the questions read aloud ("Do you hear voices?"  "Do you
    ever wet your pants?"), I can make out these parts of the
    following questions on my VCR.

    fly to thin air?
    n't really there?
    circles for hours?
    r father and mother?
    ything in red?
    apparent reason?
    of violence?
    ng food down?
    ?? on rewards?


>> The New Bedlam Rest Home for the Emotionally Interesting

Dave Hall observes that it has barbed-wire atop the outer walls.  [So that
nobody can break in, I suppose? --rjc]  It also has an emergency entrance,
(for fast checking-in of patients, perhaps) and an outdoor TV antenna.
(Apparently they can't or don't want to have cable.)

You gave me the gift of a little sister, and I'm proud of you today.

I wish you love and good will.  I wish you peace and joy.
[Bart]
I wish you better than your heart desires.
[Michael]                                   And your first kiss from a boy.

>>> As performed over the credits, with full musical back-up:

[Lisa]  [more sax stuff]

[Michael and Bart]         Happy birthday, Lisa.

[Michael] Hoo!

> Who is John Jay Smith?
===============================================================================
Listen for the characteristic Michael Jackson grunts at the ends of long
notes.  (I know this doesn't settle it one way or the other.)

Leong Heng Cheong (leong@wam.umd.edu) reports:

Like Dustin Hoffman, Michael Jackson agreed to join the show as long as his
name is not in the credits.  Nobody connected to the show is saying it's
Miachel Jackson -- and the credits (of John Jay Smith) does refer to Miachel
Jackson.  Anybody knows why this particular name is chosen?

===============================================================================
> Assorted comments and observations
===============================================================================
>> The John 3:16 man

Mark Yocom (n9043860@henson.cc.wwu.edu) explains...

The John 3:16 man is Rockin' Rollen Stewart, ``a born-again Christian whose
mission in life is to get his signs (and his mug) on national TV as often as
possible, the better to spread the word of the Lord.  Only in America.''
(according to `More of the Straight Dope', by Cecil Adams.)

The article goes on to explain that before he was born again, in 1980, his
main interest was being ``the most famous person in the world no one knows
about.''  For years he was the guy seen on telecasts of golf tournaments (of
all things -- Ed.) with the multicolored Afro wig.  This earned him the
nickname of `Rainbow Man'.

>> Lisa's poem

The line `Couldn't that Chrysler hit me instead?' refers to the car
that ran over Snowball I.

Dennis Cleary (dfcleary@ucdavis.edu):

For someone just turning eight, this seems awfully advanced.  Not that the
poem is great or anything, but already feeling betrayed by your parents is
something that I wasn't able to put into words until I was the big 1-0,
when `your legs start to go, candy doesn't taste so good anymore,' etc.

I guess it was just another example of how Lisa feels betrayed by her
family.  I thought it went nicely with the scene of Lisa singing `Happy
Birthday' to herself.  I just wonder how the character development is
going to be carried through, when they insist on only making 20 shows a
year, showing us first and second season re-runs the rest of the time.

>> The Environment

>>> Marge's hair spray

Jym Dyer suspects that there's probably a hole in the ozone layer right
above the Simpsons' house.  (FYI, Bart uses CFC-free spraypaint in the
`Bart Vs. The Space Mutants' video game.)

Jeff Meredith (mer@postgres.berkeley.edu) notes that Lisa would be thoroughly
disappointed in a mother that had such blatant disregard for Springfield's
ozone layer.

>>> Lisa's wastebasket

And Mark Walsh (beatlfan@leland.stanford.edu) noticed that ``when Bart dumped
Lisa's garbage can out onto the floor to use it as a drum, an aluminum can
fell out.  I'm disappointed.  I'm CERTAIN that Lisa would recycle.''  Members
of the Abject Admirers of Lisa Simpson the world over are profoundly
disappointed.

>> Scott Fields (am949@cleveland.Freenet.Edu) listened to it many times and
is convinced that the person singing `Crazy' on the New Bedlam wrongly
committed hotline is Tracey Ullman.

>> Amitava Biswas (ami@leland.stanford.edu) points out that Michael cannot
seem to teach Homer how to moonwalk, yet in Dancin Homer, Homer clearly
moonwalks on top of the dugout!

>> The interrogation
>>> Nice, the powerplant has its own interrogation room... {cjb}
>>> Smithers notes, ``We must have X-rayed him a hundred times.''
    The equivalent of working in a nuclear power plant for five minutes.

% (Animation borrowed from [7f02].)  It's President Bush's recent
% State of the Union Address.  (A live-action inset, not a cartoon.)
% Bush says that he wants America to be more like the Waltons than
% the Simpsons.

Hey, we're like the Waltons.  We're praying for the end of the Depression, too.

-- ``Stark Raving Dad''

Lisa: Bart, in two days, I'm going to be eight years old.
      It's a big number, almost double digits.
Bart: Well, enjoy it while you can.  Everything changes when you hit the
      big one-oh.  Your legs start to go, candy doesn't taste as good
      any more...
Lisa: Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?
Bart: Sorry, this old-timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he.
-- Pre-life crisis?  ``Stark Raving Dad''

% Lisa complains that Bart never does anything for her on her birthday,

% At breakfast, Marge asks Bart to watch Maggie while she does the laundry.
% Bart sees the Krusty Hot-Line on his cereal box and calls it.

Hi, kids!  You've reached the Krusty Hot-Line!
If you haven't asked your parent's permission, naughty-naughty!
But Krusty forgives you.

% Meanwhile, Maggie takes a ride on the ceiling fan.  Marge comes
% upstairs with the laundry and scolds Bart.

Marge: Bart, I asked you to watch your sister [Maggie].
Bart:  I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me!
-- A likely story, ``Stark Raving Dad''

% Maggie spits her pacifier at Bart.  Homer comes down to get a clean shirt,
% to find that they're all... pink?

Aagh!  Pink?
Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work.
Everybody wears white shirts.  I'm not popular enough to be different...
-- Homer finds all his shirts are pinko, ``Stark Raving Dad''

% The reason is that Bart put his lucky red hat in with the wash.
% Marge assures Homer that nobody will notice.  At the office, Burns

Smithers: Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir.
          He's one of your boobs from Sector 7-G.
Burns:    Simpson, eh?
-- ``Stark Raving Dad''

Burns:    Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort of

Smithers: I'll call security, sir.
Burns:    Excellent.  Yes, these color monitors have already
          paid for themselves...
-- Homer wears a pink shirt to work, ``Stark Raving Dad''

% Homer's coworkers razz him about wearing pink, and
% he is carted off by security to an interrogation room.  He tries to explain
% what happened, but Burns doesn't believe him.  Smithers notes that the
% body cavity search turned up nothing, nor did X-rays.  Burns recalls
% Smithers' penchant for bell-bottom trousers, but that was for the company
% performance of HMS Pinafore.  (``Oh, yes.  Your spirited hornpipes stole
% the show, as I recall.'')  Burns asks Dr. Marvin Monroe for assistance.

Burns:  Doctor, what should we do about our freewheeling fop over here?
Monroe: Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity
        took months.  That's all changed, thanks to the Marvin Monroe
        take-home personality test.  Twenty simple questions that will
        determine exactly how crazy or [makes quotation sign with fingers]

% insists it's something only he can do.  He goes to Lisa's room...

% Homer has dozed off, but is talking in his sleep...

Homer: [talking in his sleep] pancakes... football... boobies...
       pork rinds... waffles...
Man:   [to his stuffed animal]  Bubbles, it's going to be a long night.

% The next morning, Homer joins a discussion group.  The nurse tells them
% to relax.  Behind a one-way mirror, doctors monitor the discussion with
% a mind-boggling array of advanced electronics equipment and readouts.

Dave:  So I was working in an insurance company, right?  Youngest VP
       in the history of the firm, okay?  The job was my life.
       Then one Monday morning, I got up.  I got up, I couldn't leave
       the house.  I just couldn't.
Homer: Was the door locked?
Dave:  No, I just couldn't face what was out there.
Homer: Was it raining?
Nurse: No, Homer, Dave suffers from agoraphobia, a fear of open areas and
       crowds.  Please, Dave, go on.
Dave:  Thank you.  Anyway, that day I just knew I just couldn't make that
       long drive to work.
Homer: Were you out of gas?
Nurse: [glares at Homer]
Homer: Pffft.  Baby...

% Marge talks to a doctor.

Doctor: Mrs. Simpson, I'm sorry, but your husband suffers from a persecution
        complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility.
Marge:  Doctor, if you just talk to him for five minutes without mentioning
        our son Bart, you'd see how sane he is.
Doctor: You mean there really is a Bart?!  Good Lord!
-- Springing Homer from the New Bedlam Home for the Emotionally Interesting,
   ``Stark Raving Dad''

% Homer's breakfast of pancakes is interrupted by Marge, and he is released.

Doctor: Mr. Simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you're no
        threat to yourself or others.
Homer:  That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me.
        Can I have it in writing, please?
Doctor: Of course.  [hands Homer a certificate:
            This certifies
            HOMER SIMPSON
            not insane.]
-- ``Stark Raving Dad''

% Homer is grateful to The Man ...

Homer: If you ever find your marbles, come visit us.
Man:   Well, how about today?  I'm only here voluntarily.
Homer: You are!?  Why?
Man:   Well, back in 1979, I got real depressed when my `Off the Wall'
       album just got one lousy Grammy nomination.
-- ``Stark Raving Dad''

% At home, Lisa and Maggie sit at the kitchen table, and Lisa sings sadly
% to herself... ``Happy birthday to me, Happy birthday to me, Happy birthday
% overlooked middle child, Happy birthday to me.''  Lisa collapses in tears,
% and Maggie toots her noisemaker.

Joe's Taxidermy.  You snuff 'em, we stuff 'em.
-- Bart answers the phone, ``Stark Raving Dad''

% Homer starts to threaten Bart, then realizes that the doctors are watching.

Homer: [on the phone with Bart]
       I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days.
       [aside]  Isn't that cute, he's heard of you.
       [to phone]  Now make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some
       beer on ice...
Man:   Um, Homer, I'm a vegetarian, and I don't drink.
Homer: Are you <sure> you're here voluntarily?
-- Checking out of the New Bedlam Home for the Emotionally Interesting,
   ``Stark Raving Dad''

Bart:  [on the phone]
       Yes, Dad, I solemnly swear I will not tell another living soul.
       ...
       No, not even Millhouse. [hangs up]
       [intense, but brief, mental struggle]
       [dials phone]
       Hello, Millhouse?  Can you keep a secret?
Millhouse:  No.
Bart:  Oh, well, who cares.
-- I've got a secret, ``Stark Raving Dad''

% Word quickly spreads throughout town.  Apu hears the report on the radio
% and debates with himself whether he should leave his post.  He does so,
% turning the `We never close' sign over to read `Closed for the first time
% ever'.  The Simpsons front lawn is swarming with people (and even a
% helicopter), as Mayor Diamond Joe Quimby orates...

This is the uh most exciting thing to happen to our uh fair town
since the Dalai Lama visited in 1952.  And so, I hereby declare that
Route 401, currently known as the Dalai Lama Expressway, will be
henceforth be known as the Michael Jackson Expressway.
-- Mayor `Diamond' Joe Quimby, ``Stark Raving Dad''

% When Homer and The Man arrive, everybody is disappointed that it's not
% the real Michael Jackson and quickly wander off.

Lisa: Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before I join
      them, I have one question.  Today is my birthday.  You promised
      to get me something and... and... I'm afraid to ask...
Bart: You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask.
-- ``Stark Raving Dad''

% Homer tries (and fails) to wash the `INSANE' stamp off his hand.
% Lisa angrily writes Bart a letter...

Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me <for my birthday>
to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only.  Perhaps
if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far-distant
family reunion.  But rest assured, it will be purely for show. [sobs]
-- Lisa writes a letter to Bart, ``Stark Raving Dad''

% The Man sees Lisa and talks to Bart, and he suggests Bart write Lisa a
% song for her birthday.

Bart: I can't write a song, I'm only ten.
Man:  Only ten?  When I was your age, I had six gold records!
-- ``Stark Raving Dad''

Bart: Looney Toons, this is what Michael Jackson looks like.
      [shows an album]
      You're nothing but a big fat mental patient.
Man:  You'd be amazed how often I hear that.
-- ``Stark Raving Dad''

% He tells Bart to believe what he wants.  Bart asks Michael to sit down at
% the piano while he boils some coffee.

[to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March]
Lisa, her teeth are big and green.
Lisa, she smells like gasoline.
Lisa, da da da Disa.
She is my sister, her birthday, I missed-a.
-- Bart's birthday song for Lisa, ``Stark Raving Dad''

% The Man suggests they go look at Lisa so Bart can figure out what his
% feelings toward her are.  They do so from the treehouse.

Man:  Oh, she looks sad.
Bart: That's 'cause she knows you're looking at her.
Lisa: [turns]  Although I'm aware you're looking at me, I would look
      exactly the same even if you weren't.
-- ``Stark Raving Dad''

% Back at the piano...

Man:  Bart, think.  What happens to you when you turn eight?
Bart: Well, your training wheels come off your bike...
Man:  Good.  That's good.  [plays and sings]
      Your training wheels come off your bike,
      You start to notice boy you like.  Hee hee hee!
Bart: You're just putting that in because it's commercial.
Man:  [chuckles]
-- Bart's birthday song for Lisa, ``Stark Raving Dad''

% The next morning, the newspaper headline reads, ``Michael Jackson a hoax!
% Everyone mad at local boy.''  Bart wakes up Lisa by holding her nose shut
% until she gags awake.  The Man wheels in the piano, and Bart takes an
% upended wastepaper basket for a drum, and they play and sing.  (Homer covers
% his head with his pillow.)  Lisa thanks them for the best birthday present
% she's ever gotten.

Man:   [in his normal voice]  Well, my work is done here.
Bart:  Hey, Michael, what happened to your voice?
Man:   This is my real voice.  My name is Leon Kompowski, and I'm a bricklayer
       from Paterson, New Jersey.  All my life, I was very angry.  Until one
       day, I just [Michael Jackson voice] talked like this.
       [in his normal voice]  All of a sudden, everyone was smiling at me,
       and I was only doing good on this earth.  So I kept on doing it.
       To make a tired point, which one of us is truly crazy?
Homer: Not me, I've got this!  [shows his certificate]
-- ``Stark Raving Dad''

Marge: Bye-bye, Leon.
Lisa:  You're a credit to dementia!
