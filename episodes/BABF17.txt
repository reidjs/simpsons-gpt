==============================================================================
   [TV Guide] Drew Barrymore plays Krusty's long-lost daughter, a surprise to
   the clown, who betrays her in a poker game with Fat Tony (Tony Mantegna).

   [TV Guide advertisement] "Krusty ... The Dad?  Tonight, he finds out DREW
   BARRYMORE is his daughter!"  With Krusty standing off in the distance
   (looking somewhat horrified) we see Bart talking to Drew Barrymore (a.k.a.
   Krusty's daughter) saying, "Looks like I'm not the only one with a clown
   for a father!".

Blackboard:     I WILL NOT SUPRISE / THE INCONTINENT   (first and third time)

                I WILL NOT SURPRISE / THE INCONTINENT  (second and fourth
                time)

                I WILL NOT SUPRISE / THE INCONT        (fifth time)

Couch:          The family runs in and jumps toward the couch.  Suddenly, the
                picture freezes with them in mid-leap, then spins around on an
                invisible axis, showing them from a different perspective.
                When the picture un-freezes, the Simpsons fall into their
                usual places on the couch.

==============================================================================

Don Del Grande:
   ... this is not the first time the blackboard opening "accidentally" said
       two different things [the two spellings of "surprise"]?
   ... when Santa's Little Helper's doghouse exploded, the explosions
       "cascaded" the way buildings are demolished?
   ... Lisa had a TV and a VCR in her room?
   ... Stephen King's table had "The Shining"?
   ... Maggie wasn't wearing her pacifier (or her baggie) again -- this time,
       when blowing the bubbles in Homer's face?
   ... Homer was in a poker game where $2000 bets were allowed?
   ... it never occurred to Krusty to buy another violin?

Joe Green:
   ... the "Self-Help" and "Romance" booths at the Book Festival?

Darrel Jones:
   ... during Homer's grace, Maggie is also bowing her head in prayer?
   ... Fat Tony's straight flush is the 2-3-4-5-6 of diamonds?

Joe Klemm:
   ... copies of "Carrie" and "Cujo" at the Stephen King table of the book
       festival?

Andrew Levine:
   ... the Pepsi can in Sophie's mother's tent?  (Pepsi was served to people
       in the US Armed Forces in the Gulf War)
   ... although it certainly was not the intent, Marge's comment about
       Americans wanting things done faster, rather than more accurately,
       could be construed as a comment on the current Presidential election
       situation?
   ... this is the first time a performer in the closing credits is listed as
       playing a specific character?  [Jay Mohr was credited as playing
       Christopher Walken -- Ed.]

Alex J. ThreeThreeOneZeroSix:
   ... Sophie's mom looks strangely similar to Jays' girlfriend from "The
       Critic"?

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Stephen Burks:  Well, it was not as bas as last weeks episode but I don't
   think that means that it was a terrific episode.  There were a few
   redeeming qualities in some of the jokes about authors and some cute
   one-liners, but all episodes will have their moments.  Grading on the curve
   of the last two seasons, this one is a (B-), but grading on the standards
   set by those damn fine middle years, I would give this one a (C).  Yes,
   there was more of a plot than last weeks episode, but why do these episodes
   seem to be all over the place ...  if one saw the first five minutes and
   the last five minutes, they would wonder what on earth happened in the
   middle to make the current situation.  Now, there are a few episodes where
   this works well, but not this guy.  (C)

Don Del Grande:  The book fair opening was good, and the ending with Fat Tony
   had its moments (especially right at the end), but the entire beach bit
   just sat there saying "we've got to fill the time between the good parts
   somehow".  (B)

Joe Green:  An improvement over the season opener, not to mention one of the
   more flat-out funny episodes I've seen in a while.  My only major complaint
   is that the first act meandered around aimlessly for too long before the
   plot was set up.  (B+)

Carl Johnson:  What a delightful episode!  I don't know what it is about
   bloodthirsty organized crime syndicates that's so funny, but, man!  what a
   funny show this was.  Clearly the best episode since "Bart the Mother".
   There were a few weak spots, but well, no one's perfect.  Not even Mike
   Scully!  (A-)

Joe Klemm:  As the past seasons show, one of the good episodes of each season
   is usually the second non-THOH episode of each season, and this year is no
   exception.  While I don't care much about Krusty's daughter, the idea of
   Krusty trying to show that he cares about her is well-handled.  Plus,
   Homer's idiocy provides a lot of humorous moments in the episode.  Now if
   only they did a "Firestarter" crack (a double crack at two of the guest
   stars).  (A)

Andrew Levine:  An episode which it's hard to get excited about, ICP fails to
   delight or offend; it's simply too much like any other episode.  This is
   not a comment on the suckiness of recent seasons so much as for the
   staleness that the show most likely would have suffered anyway after 12
   years.  Another fair (it's always a beer fair, or a chili fair, or a
   dessert fair, or state fair, or a book fair ...), another instance of Homer
   breaking and entering -- into the plot ... There doesn't seem to be
   anything in here strange or demented, funny or humanizing.  There's nothing
   truly jarring, and the author jokes were occasionally amusing, but just
   because it's not an uncomfortable rut to travel through, doesn't mean it's
   not a rut.  (B-)

Paul Melnyk:  I'll have to agree a bit with Andrew Levine's review.  The
   episode had good intentions, but was just a bit weak.  I think it could
   have been strung together a little more.  There were some good jokes [such
   as] "Devil's Advocate," but many were on the mediocre line.  Also, a little
   more with the Krusty story could have been stronger.  It was just revealed
   at the end of the first act, and his daughter only accepts Krusty after
   getting her violin back, which was a bit weak.  It seemed a bit cop-outish.
   None the less, it was satisfying enough.  (C+)

Michael Nusair:  This season is looking promising.  There have been three new
   episodes, and all three have been pretty good.  While tonight's episode
   didn't start off too well (fireworks?), it quickly picked up.  Starting
   from the book fair, this was a fairly solid episode.  It had plenty of
   laughs, a solid plot, and good characterization.  It even came pretty close
   to having Homer *not* get seriously hurt (though they blew it with him
   getting shot when the credits rolled).  Overall, another above average
   episode out of season 12.  Let's hope they keep coming.  (B+)

Abhi Ray:  Eh, I was pretty bored.  The jokes were a little thin, and there
   was nothing interesting about the plot at all.  For example, the mob climax
   at the 3rd act wasn't nearly as energetic as in "Mayored to the Mob."  And
   unlike "Burn Baby Burns" or "Mother Simpson," there's no interesting setup
   as to how Krusty's daughter finds her dad.  I guess parts of the episode
   were sweet, and there were no sour jokes (unlike last week's episode).
   Ultimately, to paraphrase Ondre [Lombard's] review of "Kidney Trouble,"
   this episode gave neither a good aftertaste nor a bad aftertaste, it gave
   nothing at all.  (D)

Mike Reed:  Wow.  I have no problem calling this episode an instant classic.
   It started off somewhat slow with the book fair thing, but once Sophie got
   into the plot it picked right back up.  We saw Homer as Homer, the bumbling
   but loving father, instead of the jerk.  Krusty was a three dimensional
   character.  This episode had everything I was hoping for. Maybe we can put
   that BABF20 crud behind us and settle in for a solid season Here's hoping!
   (A)

Robin Steinmann:  This episode showed that sometimes the less OFF the better.
   Whenever Homer showed up it dropped in quality: the fireworks, the
   gossip/prayer, etc.  In most of the show, Homer was replaceable, and the
   rest of the family was mostly redundant.  Krusty appeared like a earlier
   Homer, back from the times when he still cared about his kid's feelings.
   If these rumours about a show revolving around various Springfieldonians
   are true, I'm really looking to this, as if we hadn't so much S10+ Homer in
   this episode, it would have gotten a better mark than the final:  (B-)

Alex J. ThreeThreeOneZeroSix:  As far as "revelation" episodes go, this is one
   of the better ones. The relationship between Sophie and Krusty is built up
   nice enough, and because of this development, I was actually rooting for
   Krusty and Homer to get the violin back.  Other than the first act, Homer
   is in terrific form -- "My uncle still has my nose" is one of the funniest
   simple lines he has said in a while.  I also had the notion that if
   Sophie's hair was matted down she wouldn't have looked so odd.  This must
   be a good episode if the only thing I disliked was the artwork for a
   onetime character!  (B+)

Todd Willis:  This episode started out with a nice, realistic premise, but got
   boring after the first act.  This episode wasn't bad or anything, just
   mediocre to the point of having no emotion response to it.  The first act
   was the best, primarily because of the authors and the fireworks.  The rest
   of the show lagged on, and I got tired of seeing so much of Krusty.  There
   also weren't too many good jokes in the show.  (D+)

Yours Truly:  Krusty gets to know his long-lost daughter.  Well, at least he
   did -- at the episode's end, I felt I should have known a little more about
   her.  (For example, how did she manage to stand up to her obviously
   outraged mother, and strike out in search of Krusty?)  The mother, too, is
   mainly a cipher defined by anger.  On the other hand, Drew Barrymore is
   sweet as the voice of Sophie.  Both Homer's firecracker rampage and the
   raid on Fat Tony's compound are funnier than I anticipated, with Fat Tony
   and his violin playing a high point.  A good, if slightly uneven and
   superficial, show.  (B+)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B- (2.76)   Std Dev.: 0.9694   (22 reviews computed)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Musical references

Andrew Levine:  "I Like that Girl" by NRBQ [is the] song played as Krusty and
   Sophie bond, also over the closing credits.


While we're on the subject of music, Benjamin Robinson writes:  The song
   playing while Krusty and Sophie play on the beach, and Fat Tony's violin
   riff are both creations of "The Simpsons'" talented musical director, Alf
   Clausen.  He even gets a special credit for them, a rarity on the show.


>> Name that reference

Pop quiz:  In the couch gag, when the family spun around in "stop-time" or
   "bullet-time," were they referencing a popular ad for clothing retailer The
   Gap, or the hit movie, "The Matrix?"  As we shall see, the answer is not so
   clear-cut.


Andrew Levine:  I thought it was more like the Gap ad, since none of the
   Simpsons had shades or leather-anything on.  If they wanted to spoof "The
   Matrix," they would've done that.


Paul Melnyk:  I still think "The Matrix" really brought the bullet-time shots
   to attention, though.


Andrew Levine answers:  Uh, no.  The Gap ads were popular when they came out.
   In fact, they were so well-liked, they helped bring the briefly lived
   swing-revival craze into the mainstream.  There was a huge buzz about them,
   and "Khakis swing" inspired numerous parodies (in commercials for
   furniture, TV promos, etc).  Several industry magazines named "Khakis
   Swing" one of the five or ten best TV ads of the year.  I remember reading
   in Entertainment Weekly in '97 or '98 a brief article on how the swivel
   shot (which we now call "bullet time") was filmed.

   So don't go telling me that "The Matrix" brought bullet time to the
   national attention.


Sydney Assbasket notes:  Technically, the Gap ads used "stop-time," where the
   action is frozen.  The famous shot in "The Matrix" (Keanu dodging the
   bullets) is bullet-time, where the cameras go off sequentially.  The
   cameras used in stop-time go off simultaneously.


Dan Rudolph:  I believe the Matrix used some stop-time as well.  Bullet time
   was an expansion on the technique.  It was pretty cool.


[Whew!  I decided to go with "The Matrix" as The Reference.  It was the more
   recent and the more famous of the two, and most like what the audience
   would have thought of when they saw the opening.  Also, the posing was more
   similar to the movie than to the Gap ad -- Ed.]


>> Episode capsules for Dummies

Joe Klemm, certainly no dummy, writes:  The "Dummies" series of books are
   books that provide information and assistance to the readers.  Usually,
   these books are for computer related topics, like Windows 98 and web site
   building.  However, these books cover a lot of different topics.  Among
   them include gardening, classical music, and even crossword puzzles.


>> It's all in the family

Don Del Grande describes synergy, Groening style:  There was a "Chapter Books"
   booth (just before the talk with the authors); Matt Groening's sister
   Maggie and his brother-in-law (Lisa's husband) Craig Bartlett work on the
   chapter books based on Craig's "Hey Arnold!" TV series (as of the first
   airing, two had been released and a third was due out in a couple of
   months).


>> The Cincinnati Bungles

Benjamin Robinson:  The Cincinnati Bengals are an American football team.  You
   might recall football as the sport that delayed this episode's broadcast by
   a few minutes on the East Coast.


Alex J. ThreeThreeOneZeroSix adds:  The Cincinnati Bengals are also the worst
   professional football team of the decade(this has been confirmed, but
   anyone that follows the sport would know that regardless).  Even a
   ridiculously expensive stadium didn't improve their record.  You might as
   well add that to the capsule, too.  Take care.  Good-day.

   (I figured the staff had a joke planned for the Bengals, since they
   referenced their cheerleaders, but they didn't.  I was kind'a disappointed,
   being a fellow citizen of Cincinnati and all.)


>> The Mother of all Battles

Benjamin Robinson writes:  The Persian Gulf War is well-known, but this
   episode did include some touches that went beyond the obvious.  At the ill-
   received USO show, one soldier complains the cheerleaders are an "insult to
   our Muslim hosts."  That was a concern for the United States forces, who
   had to tread the fine line between attacking the enemy, while not
   alienating their uneasy Allies.  Among other things, drinking -- prohibited
   under Muslim law -- was either banned or severely restricted.

   Krusty mentions the "anthrax in the air."  The Iraqis were accused of
   possessing biological and chemical weapons, including strains of the
   anthrax bacteria.  Although they were supposedly not launched during the
   war, they remain one of the suspected causes of Gulf War Syndrome, a
   mysterious disease affecting soldiers returning from the front.

   The backdrop to Krusty's and Sophie's mother's tryst is a curtain of fire
   streaming from torched oil wells.  This was a dominant image from the war's
   aftermath.  They didn't burn out overnight as we saw in the show.  Putting
   them out required months of difficult work by firefighters.

   Finally, Krusty thwarts Sophie's mom's attempts to assassinate Saddam
   Hussein.  Some of the critics of the war say the Allied forces
   miscalculated by refusing to depose Hussein while they had the chance. The
   US claimed to be bound by a self-imposed rule not to assassinate foreign
   leaders in the absence of a formally declared war (nudge, nudge, wink,
   wink), and the Persian Gulf conflict indeed wasn't so declared.  I guess
   now we know what really happened!


>> Oscar *who*?

Aaron Hirshberg:  Oskar Homolka is a European actor.  Check out the Internet
   Movie Database for his credits.


Stephen Gutknecht did, and found this:  Oscar was adept at playing villains.
   Of medium height, rotund and stocky with dark hair, squinty eyes, bushy
   eyebrows which gave him a menacing look and sinister looking smile he was
   perfect for those parts.  Born August 12, 1898 in Vienna, Austria he began
   his career on the German and Austrian stages and progressed on to film.  He
   left Europe as Hitler came to power and began his film career playing
   foreign character roles.  The pinnacle of his career came with an Oscar
   nomination for his role as Uncle Chris in "I Remember Mama" (1948).  He
   died on January 27, 1978 of pneumonia in Sussex, England at age 79.
   [Someone named "falloutboy" notes, "Oscar's most famous role was probably
   as the one-eyed creep 'Krull' in 'Mr. Sardonicus'"]

   Now, I don't know his films.  I suspect one of the pictures that Krusty
   looks at is a shot from a film?  What about the picture of the clown in an
   Electric Chair?

   [Mr. Gutknecht goes on to add ...] I think I found it.

   Hitchcock move "Sabotage".  Oskar Homolka plays Mr. Victor.  This web site
   says: "Mrs. Verloc, repelled by the truth, kills Verloc with a carving
   knife."  So There is a scene in this movie where Oskar Homolka is killed
   with a carving knife!


>> Card sharks

Stephen Burks has some useful information next time you wager your child's
   prize possession in a poker game:  A Straight flush is the second highest
   hand in poker just below a royal flush ... Of course a five of a kind will
   beat that, but only when a wild card is used.

   Five of a Kind
   Royal Flush
   Straight Flush
   Four of a Kind
   Full House
   Flush
   Straight
   Three of a Kind
   Two Pair
   Pair
   High Card


J. D. Salazar adds:  Technically a Royal Flush is a straight flush, the
   highest possible straight flush, so a straight flush is the best hand in
   poker (without wild cards).


>> Springfield Round Table

The authors -- and some of the other people -- mentioned in this episode


Andrew Levine:  Amy Tan is a Chinese-American author from Oakland, California.
   In 1989, her first novel, "The Joy Luck Club," won The National Book Award
   and the LA Times Book Award in 1989.


Jeff Cross adds:  Chinese-American author specializing in the relationships
   between mothers and daughters who did for the Chinese experience in America
   what her influence Louise Erdrich did for the American Indian experience.
   Has only written five books to date, including Lisa's favorite "The Joy
   Luck Club."  Is in a band with Stephen King and Dave Barry, which performed
   in Boston in November 2000.


Benjamin Robinson:  Interesting aside: "The Joy Luck Club" was made into a
   movie.  One of the actresses in the film was Lauren Tom, who is also on
   Matt Groening's other show, "Futurama."


Andrew Levine continues:  Tom Wolfe helped pioneer the New Journalism with his
   books "The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby" and "The Electric
   Kool-Aid Acid Test" in the early '70s.  Early in his career, he attacked
   the New Yorker as being stuffy symbols of the old literary guard.  Terry
   Southern, Rex Reed, Hunter S. Thompson were all parts of the sexy,
   personal, loud, pop-cult-hip "New Journalism" he helped to popularize.


Benjamin Robinson adds:  Wolfe also wrote "Bonfire of the Vanities."  One of
   his trademarks was his seemingly inexhaustible supply of white suits.


Andrew Levine:  From Harvard to a staff position on The New Yorker, John
   Updike turned his brainy pedigree into a successful career as a novelist,
   essayist and critic. His novels "Rabbit, Run" (1960), "Couples" (1978) and
   Pulitzer winner "Rabbit is Rich" (1981) exemplify his sophisticated take on
   contemporary middle-class tragedy.  One of contemporary fiction's most
   prolific writers, Updike has also written numerous short stories and poems,
   as well as engineered a group-written mystery story on the Internet.

   Tommy Lasorda managed the LA Dodgers from 1978 to 1996.  A master of
   motivational speaking, Lasorda, who spoke of "bleeding Dodger blue" out of
   loyalty, was an inspiration to both new players (he managed a staggering
   nine Rookie of Year winners in his 19-year tenure) and veterans (his
   Dodgers stole two World Series out from under the feet of the Yankees and
   Athletics).  Now working part-time as a Dodger scout, Lasorda managed this
   year's US Olympic team to a gold medal in Sydney, their first since 1984.


Joe Klemm:  If you ask "Who is one of the most successful authors of the past
   few decades?", one very positive answer is Stephen King.  The master of
   horror, King has written many successful novels, novellas, and screenplays
   (not as successful as his other works) and short story anthologies over the
   last 25 or so years. Among his best works include "Carrie," "The Stand,"
   and "The Shining," which was the subject of a THOH story.  You should also
   know that Stephen King has also written a few non-fiction works including
   one about horror stories.


Jeff Cross adds:  Incredibly prolific under his own name and as Richard
   Bachman, and has had most of his works dramatized for either television or
   film.  My college major advisor Stewart O'Nan was sued by him over his
   novel "The Speed Queen," which was originally titled "Dear Stephen King."


Jeff Cross continues:  Tom Clancy -- Former Baltimore insurance salesman who
   single-handedly made patriotic war novels popular again in post-Vietnam
   America with "The Hunt for Red October," which he never expected to do
   better than 10,000 hardcovers.  Has written nearly a dozen novels in the
   Jack Ryan series, six nonfiction books on the operations of the more
   glamorous military units in the US, two treatises on military command with
   retired generals, and created the "Op-Center," "Power Plays," and "Net
   Force" series subcontracted to Jeff Rovin, Jerome Preisler, and Steve Perry
   respectively.  Three movies, two miniseries, eight computer games, and a
   board game have been based on his works.  Bruce Fierstein, author of "Real
   Men Don't Eat Quiche," considers him and Stephen King to be the only two
   Real Man authors.


Benjamin Robinson:  Maya Angelou -- Poetess whose elegant verse was showcased
   at President Clinton's first inauguration.  She also wrote the book, "I
   Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."

   Christopher Walken -- Intimidating actor who plays a lot of psychopaths and
   tightly-wound people in the movies.

   Mikhail Baryshnikov -- Ballet dancer and choreographer.

   Jacques Costeau -- Undersea explorer and environmentalist.  Costeau also
   helped develop SCUBA gear, the better to visit the undersea realm.


>> "My little hamentashen"

Carl Johnson explains:  Hamentashen is a food us Jews eat around the holiday
   of Purim.  Purim is a joyous festival of costumes and crap like that,
   similar in spirit to Halloween, and takes place usually in March or April.
   The Purim festival tells the story of Queen Esther and the evil Hamen, and
   whenever anyone says Hamen's name, everyone is required to boo and make a
   lot of noise.  Hamentashen has something to do with Hamen, but I've
   forgotten what that is.  Imagine Homer's "Town Crier Hat" in "Lisa the
   Iconoclast", and imagine said hat made out of pastry/ cookie dough, and
   filled with jelly.  That's Hamentashen.  Pretty good stuff.


Nerys clarifies:  The Hebrew word for the cookie is "Oznei Hamen" which
   actually means "ear of Hamen." While it is really often mistaken to be
   Hamen's hat, I am on a one-girl mission to dispell this myth and let the
   American people know the truth. Please believe me on this. After eleven
   years at Jewish parochial school and having heard more megillot esther read
   to me and working at too many Purin carnivals without being paid, I think I
   know all there is to become preoccupied with on the subject of Purim. And
   by the way, the best hamentashen fillings are strawberry jelly and lemon
   jelly. All other fillings, including chocolate, are no good. Believe me on
   that, too.


Joshua Kaufman adds:  And what's interesting is that Sophie's head actually
   kinda looks like one because of the way her hair is.


>> Car Watch in brief

Joe Green keeps it short and sweet:  Sophie's mom drives a 1967 Chevy Impala.
   Krusty drives a Porsche 911 Targa.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Joe Green alterna-title for this show is:  The Second Coming of Krust


According to Fox (by way of Bill LaRue), this episode scored a Nielsen rating
   of 9.3 (14 share).  This works out to 16.4 million viewers.  Among adults
   aged 18 to 49, the rating was 8.3 (18 share).


Ryan Mead notes that Joe Mantegna's birthday is the day after this episode
   aired in the United States.


Jennifer Bobiak:  It's worth noting that Jay Mohr also plays Christopher
   Walken on Saturday Night Live.  [Or, he used to play Walken, anyway -- Ed.]


Chris Palm:  Did anyone else find it very amusing that John Updike was a guest
   voice for this episode, when his only line was "John Updike."?


Benjamin Robinson:  If that's a manta ray circling Lisa, she needn't worry as
   much. Unless you count being scared to death by it, they aren't normally
   harmful to people.

Marge: Don't you two have a list of chores to do?

Homer: Yeah, we're heroes!  But where's *our* parade?
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Next on the chore list is unsticking the drawer in the stand next to the
% front couch.  Homer struggles to pull the drawer open, knocking off and
% breaking the lamp in the process.

Homer: It's hopeless!
Bart:  [holds up a small firework] Or is it?
Homer: [not looking] Yeah, it's hopeless!
Bart:  I said, "or is it"!

Marge: Homer, what are you doing?
Homer: Listen, do you want the job done right, or do you want it done fast?
Marge: Well, like all Americans, fast, but--
Bart:  [lights the fuse] Clear!
       [The exploding firework knocks the drawer out and leaves ugly blast

Homer: It's gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean this place up.
Lisa:  [comes to doorway] What's going on here?!
Homer: Uh ... honey ... there's point in every father's life when he blows

       [Offscreen explosion]
Homer: Oh, Lisa, this must be a rough time for you.  Do you have any friends
       or family you can stay with?
Lisa:  [choking up as she picks up a damaged stuffed bear] You've ruined all
       my stuff.
Homer: Oh, come on.  Tell us how we can make it up to you.  Hey, pretend it's
       your birthday!
Lisa:  It *is* my birthday!

       now?
King:  Oh, I don't feel like writing horror right now.

King:  I'm working on a biography of Benjamin Franklin.  He's a fascinating
       man.  He discovered electricity, [clouds gather and King's voice
       becomes menacing] and used it to torture small animals and green
       mountain men.  And that key he tied to the end of a kite?  [thunder

Lenny:   Oh, Maya, you're a national treasure!

% Lisa takes the microphone next.

Lisa:    Miss Tan, I loved "The Joy Luck Club".  It really showed me how the
         mother-daughter bond can triumph over adversity.
Amy Tan: No, that's not what I meant at all.  You couldn't have gotten it more
         wrong.

% At Krusty's book-signing table at the book festival, Krusty tries to explain
% to Sophie why he's not her father.

Krusty: Listen, honey, a lot of kids think of me as their daddy, but I'm just
        a simple TV legend.  Here, have a key chain.  [gives Sophie a Krusty
        key chain]
Sophie: No, I'm sure you're my father.  You met my mom during the Gulf War.
Krusty: [getting nervous] Was you mother an Israeli flight attendant?
Sophie: No....
Krusty: Cokie Roberts?
Sophie: No, she was a soldier -- chestnut brown hair, kind-of shy, 32

Krusty:    "Saddam Hussein"?  They should call him "So Damn Insane"!
Soldier 1: Hey!  You're just fanning the flames of hatred!
Krusty:    Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, just when you thought the desert couldn't
           get any hotter, it's the Cincinnati Bengal cheerleaders!
           [The cheerleaders do cartwheels onstage]
Soldier 2: I can't look at that!  I have a girlfriend back home!
Soldier 3: This is an insult to our Muslim hosts!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

During the show, a desert wind kicked up.  [The cheerleaders were covered
with a pyramid of sand.]  I sought shelter in a nearby tent.  There was your
mother -- looking like a beautiful mirage.  Maybe it was the anthrax in the
air, maybe it was it was the fact that the Arab women weren't biting, whatever
it was, it was magic.  [Krusty and Sophie's mom kissed and fell into bed.]
-- Krusty, voiceover in a flashback, "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Then, late in the morning, Sophie's mom woke up and realized she was late
% for her mission.  Krusty grabbed her arm.  "Here's your mission: get down
% with the clown!" he said.  Sophie's mom explained that she's supposed to
% assassinate Saddam.  She got away, and Krusty was worried about how a lack
% of Saddam could hurt his comedy act.
%
% Atop a desert hill, Sophie's mom found Saddam Hussein in a convoy of trucks.
% As she caught him in her bazooka's sight, Krusty tackled her in desperation.
% The bazooka's missile fired into the air and blew up a crate of Duff beer

I just saved my baseball bit!  "Who's Sayin's on first, I A-tol'ya's on

% Back in the present, Krusty continues his story to Sophie on a bench.

Krusty: When I came to, she was gone!  ...and the war had been over for eight
        months.  Anyway, how'd you finally find me?
Sophie: All Mom ever said was my father was some pathetic clown, so I typed
        "pathetic clown" into a search engine, and your name popped right up.
        [Car horn honks]
        It's mom!
Krusty: Hey, how ya been?  Remember me?
        [Sophie's mother scowls and revs the car engine]
        [to Sophie:] You better get going.  It was nice meeting ya.  Thanks
        for coming out.
Sophie: But ... I was hoping maybe we could do some stuff together, like go
        to the beach and junk.
Krusty: Look, you're a sweet kid, but I'm not exactly father material -- I
        curse, I gamble, I pick fights with homeless people, I...
        [Sophie starts to cry]
        What's wrong with your eyes?  You need a Claritin or something?  Oh,
        alright.  You get one trip to the beach...
        [Sophie gasps happily]

% At the Simpsons' dinner table, Homer says grace.

Homer: Dear Lord, bless this humble meal, and did you hear about Krusty?
       Whoo, man!  I mean, I knew he was a player, but jeez, a kid!
Marge: Homer, that's not a prayer, that's gossip.
Homer: Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters.  So, how's Maude Flanders
       doing up there?  She playing the field?  Ooh, yeah, really?  All those
       guys?
       [The rest of the family gapes]
       Amen.

% At the beach with Sophie, Krusty lays on a beach towel and pours himself
% a drink from a flask.  He puts on a blindfold and lays down.

Krusty: Okay, kid, there's the water.  Knock yourself out.
Sophie: Come on, Dad, let's go bodysurfing or boogieboarding!
Krusty: Listen, kid, I'm not the kind of dad who, you know, does things, or
        says stuff or looks at ya.  But the love is there!

% his blindfold just in time to be hit in the head by the Frisbee.

Krusty: [chuckles]  Hey, ya beat me!  What a great day we've had, huh?
Sophie: You know, for a clown, you're not really a lot of fun.
        [They both sigh]
Krusty: Boy, fatherhood is one tough gig.  I don't get how other guys do it.

% for parenting advice.  They walk along the beach.

Krusty: You know, Homer, I've spent my whole life entertaining kids, and I
        just realized I don't know the first thing about 'em.
Homer:  Well, I won't lie.  Fatherhood isn't easy, like motherhood, but I
        wouldn't trade it for anything ... 'cept for some mag wheels.  Oh,
        man, that would be sweet.
Lisa:   [offscreen] Dad!  Dad!
Homer:  Just a second, honey.  Daddy's on his high horse.
Lisa:   [in the water, circled by a manta ray] Daaaaaad!
Homer:  Yeah, I'm watching, honey.  Nice cannonball.  [to Krusty:] Anywho,

% Finally, they sit and watch the sunset.

Sophie: It's nice that you don't always have to be "on".
Krusty: I thought I *was* on!  When was I off?  That bit about the tide pool?
        I tell ya, it killed at Jacques Cousteau's funeral.
Sophie: Dad, relax.  Just enjoy the sunset.  [takes out and plays a violin]
Krusty: Hey, I know that song.  My dad used to play that when I was a boy.

Marge:  Oh Krusty, I'm sure she just needs time to get used to you.
Homer:  Marge, may I play devil's advocate for a moment?
Marge:  Sure, go ahead.
        [Homer plays the Devil's Advocate pinball machine at the arcade;
        Krusty waits for him to finish]
Homer:  Now, what were we talking about?
Krusty: My daughter's violin!
Homer:  Oh, right.  Why don't we just break into Fat Tony's compound and
        get it back?
Krusty: Really?  You'd help me take on the mob?
Homer:  For a casual acquaintance like you?  Absolutely.
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Unfortunately, when Homer and Krusty arrive at the compound, they realize
% there's a Mafia summit by the number of cars.

Krusty: Every mob family in the country's here -- the Cuomos, the Travoltas,
        the Lasordas, the Boyardees....
Homer:  This is perfect.  If I know Fat Tony, which I don't, he'll be
        distracted by his hosting duties.
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Legs and Louie are guarding the entrance, so Homer and Krusty try to go over
% them on the power line.  The power line unexpectedly sags, putting them
% right over Legs and Louie.

Legs:   Hey, I heard there's a lunar eclipse tonight.  Maybe we should look up.
Louie:  Nah.  For me, it's solar or nothing.
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Fat Tony addresses the other mafia members.  He tells them that they have
% pasta, and to leave any money outside their doors for laundering.

Fat Tony: Now some unpleasant news.   I have learned that someone in this room
          is a squealer.
Legs:     We've narrowed it down to either Johnny Tightlips or Frankie the
          Squealer.
Frankie:  Okay, it's me!  I can't help it!  I just like squealing!  It makes
          me feel big!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Homer and Krusty look in doors down a hallway.  They find Frankie the
% Squealer being beaten up.  He doesn't learn his lesson, and discloses Fat
% Tony's real name: Marion.
%
% In the next room, they find a violin case, but when they turn on the lights,
% they see a bed full of violin cases.  They open up a couple, but they just
% contain guns.  Homer tries to go into a vent, but he doesn't fit.  Then they
% overhear Legs and Louie planning to jump on Fat Tony's bed.  Krusty decides
% they should just take all the cases.
%
% Back in the room with Fat Tony, the mafia members decide their website will
% be crime.org.  Just then, Homer and Krusty wander through the room with
% their piles of violin cases.  Startled, they drop the cases, and the guns
% fire in the air.  The mobsters take out their guns and soon there is a
% flurry of bullets in the air.  Krusty and Homer avoid being hit by ducking
% under it all.  Krusty finally finds the case containing the violin, and they
% leave.  Johnny Tightlips is shot.

Legs:   Johnny Tightlips, where'd they hit ya?
Johnny: I ain't sayin' nothin'.
Legs:   But what'll I tell the doctor?
Johnny: Tell him to suck a lemon.

% Sophie wakes the next morning to "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" being played
% crudely on a violin.  She looks out the window and sees it's Krusty.
% Excited, she runs outside.

Sophie: You did it!  You got it back!  Thanks, Dad.
Krusty: "Dad" -- that still sounds weird to me, but I'm glad we're friends
        again.
Sophie: [opens the case] And you've lined the case with money!  Small bills,
        unmarked, and nonsequential!
Krusty: Holy simoleans!  There must be five grand in there!  Oh, which I
        intentionally put in there for you, you lucky little hamantaschen.
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% Krusty asks for a song, but Sophie is interrupted by gunfire.  Homer runs
% as Louie and Legs chase him down.  Frankie the Squealer continues to squeal
% on Homer.

Homer: I said I was sorry!
Legs:  Alright, fair enough.
Louie: Class act.
Homer: Sorry you're such jerks!  Ha-ha!
-- "Insane Clown Poppy"

% So, the chase continues.  Homer is shocked when one of the bullets actually
% hits him.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Act Time:  5:01,  Total Time:  20:17]
%
% "I Like that Girl" by NRBQ plays over the end credits.  The Gracie sound
% is John Updike laughing and Krusty telling him to shut up.
