> Reviews
===============================================================================
Tony Hill: This episode was terribly disjointed.  The bar plot was not a
    very good transition to the flying plot, IMHO.  The "Cheers" takeoff
    and the window washer gag were the highlights.  Once again we see
    Homer sort of hovering above the main plot (no pun intended) with no
    real role.  I give it a C, and that includes holiday generosity.

James Simon: I laughed my ass off the whole show. not only was it funny
    as hell but it had some great lines and further proof of Smithers'
    homosexuality.  I think this week's hint gave it away.  The best
    line was when Marge was watching Alive: "Hey, pass me a chunk of
    copilot".  I almost cried.

Peter Kretschman: Not a semblance of congruity to the whole thing!  And
    the gags weren't even all that great (a poor plot can be saved by a
    few "classic" moments).  Also...I don't mind when Homer et all get a
    little out of character, but I felt the writers were pushing it.  I
    give it a D+.

Sylvester Hamilton: I'd love to say this was a good episode...but
    well...it wasn't.  I could hardly tell what it was "about," as it
    hopped from theme to theme (e.g., Homer's bar searching, Marge's
    therapy).  [...] Why try to cram in a season full of plot in one
    episode?

Marc Singer: This one had too much plot (or rather, too many plots
    crammed into one show).  Honestly, the only funny part was the
    Cheers appearance, and they didn't do anything with it.  (They also
    gave away 90% of it in the #$@%$#@ promos.)

Matthew Kurth: A rather forgettable outing. 6/10

Dave Hall: I thought I'd never actually find myself writing a bad
    review, but I didn't find this episode all that funny or
    interesting.  The plot, well what plot?  It had so many holes.  I
    feel the jokes were either predictable, lame, reused or had a
    generic feeling.

Leighton Shell: I thought this episode was a really good one.  I thought
    that what with all of the recent airline trouble (award winner for
    understatement of the year) it was very topical, and it was the
    first show in a while that was a little controversial.

Mark Irving: Pardon the TV GUIDE pun, but JEERS to the last week's worth
    of advertising that the Cheers gang would be on the Simpsons...It
    was one of the first times I ever PLANNED to watch the Simpsons and
    it lasted less than 20 seconds...LAME!  No less.  Fox should be
    ashamed.

John J. Wood: Grade: D. I cannot argue with the negative reviews.  This
    episode was disjointed, its gags formulaic and flat, and its lone
    consolation is that we learn more about Marge.  Yes, it would have
    been nice to have seen more Cheers, but the key word that came to my
    mind after watching it on video again was "stale."

Nick J. Worthey: I have one thing to say about last night's episode:
    "That was a well plotted piece of non clap-trap that never made me
    want to retch!"  [8F20 pun - ed]

Eric Rose: What was up with the 12/18 Fear of Flying episode?  It was
    just not classic stuff.  Marge was totally out of character, Homer
    getting thrown out of Moe's for the sugar bowl trick?!?!  Just not
    funny, IMHO.

Don Del Grande: B - There were a few good moments in the story, but the
    ending to Marge's story wasn't particularly funny, and Homer's story
    has him still unwelcome at Moe's when the show ends.  (Just like
    8F23 ends with Homer in the Spinemelter 2000, and 1F22 ends with the
    (empty) pool still in the backyard, and 2F02 ends without a mayor...
    )

Ryan Maves: It sucked for one simple reason.  Homer is funny.  Bart is
    funny.  Willy the Groundskeeper is funny.  Principal Skinner is
    funny.  The Flanders family is funny.  C. Montgomery Burns is the
    living avatar of "funny".  Even Lisa has her moments of being funny.
    Marge, however, is not and never can be funny.

Yours truly: Not a terribly well-written episode.  The excuse for
    throwing Homer out was forced, the Cheers thing was a bit of a
    waste, and there's no way they could pay for $30/hour psychiatric
    help for Marge.  Some good jokes, but forgettable.  Grade: D-.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> "It's Raining Men"

Many people correctly identified this song as sung in 1983 by The
    Weather Girls, previously known as Two Tons O'Fun due to the
    Rubenesque statures of its members.  Sylvester, a disco artist who
    died of AIDS a few years ago, used the duo as his backup singers,
    according to Ron Harris.
    
    Stephen Schwartz says it was written by Paul Shaffer of David
    Letterman fame.  One of the singers is Martha Wash, an enormous
    woman whose voice is probably most recognizable from most of the
    songs on Black Box's 1990 debut album, "Dreamland".  Samples of her
    voice also appear in C&C Music Factory's dance hit, "Everybody Dance
    Now".  (I believe she was uncredited for this, and there was a legal
    scuffle.)

>> The "Cheers" scene

Don Del Grande rambles, "The names `Norm' and `Cliff' (and `Malone')
    weren't used, although Woody did say `Mr. Peterson' - I know who
    they were _supposed_ to be, but that definitely was _not_ `Cheers'
    (among other things, the `real' Cheers does not have booths along
    the wall with the windows, and the doorway area is elevated
    slightly); also, why didn't they get Kelsey Grammer to tape a
    `Frasier Crane' line while he was doing 2F02, as there was a Frasier
    character in the scene?  (Two possibilities: one, Frasier and
    Sideshow Bob sound alike; two, NBC is still using the Frasier
    character.)"

>> The "Little Black Box" bar

Tony Hill notes, "The black box, of course, contains the flight data
    recorded and cockpit voice recorded.  Since it usually survives
    crashes, some wags have suggested building the plane out of `black
    box' material."

>> For the "Where is Springfield Crowd"

Tony Hill correctly asserts that it can't be in Alaska or Hawaii.  "It's
    also probably not one of the states which border Mexico, since the
    killer bees are in those states already."

       off let me off -- [runs up and down the aisle]
        [the plane takes off as the family watches]
Homer: It's OK, Marge.  We don't need to go on a trip; we'll just wait
       for the killer bees to come to us.
-- Homer, consoling, "Fear of Flying"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 8:33]
%
% The family unpack their suitcases at home.

 Bart: You know, I have this feeling that we forgot something...
  Abe: [still on the plane] Aaaaah!
Homer: Ehh, I'm sure it's nothing.
 Lisa: Mom, are you feeling any better?
Marge: Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.
Homer: Permit _me_ to solve the mystery: your mother has a fear of
       flying.
 Bart: So much for the days when I could say, "At least my _mother_'s
       normal."
Marge: Well, everybody's got a fear of something.
Homer: Not everybody.
Marge: [to Homer] Sock puppets!
Homer: Where?!  Where?!  Aah!  Aah!
 Lisa: Mom, are you _sure_ you don't want to discuss it?
Marge: Sure as sugar...[laughs awkwardly]
-- No dysfunctionality here, "Fear of Flying"

Homer: Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what
       happened.  Push it deep down inside her, so she'll never annoy us
       again.
 Lisa: But if we don't encourage her to vent her feelings, they can come
       out in other ways.
Marge: I just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog...
       they've been living in sin!
        [the pets whimper]
-- Not with each other, but..., "Fear of Flying"

% The kitchen table is covered with lavishly prepared food.  Marge
% stands in front of the stove, three boiling pots on the go.  The rest
% of the family walks to the kitchen door.

 Lisa: Mom, you've been cooking all night?
Marge: [happy] Judge, jury, and executioner, all rolled into one, you
       are!
 Lisa: See, Dad, I told you Mom would have problems.
Marge: No, no, honey, it's all right.  Really, I'm fine, I'm all right.
       Mother always said, "Don't complain.  Be good.  Behave.  Behave.
       Be nice.  Smile.  Be polite.  Don't wink..." [walks out]
Homer: You heard your mother's ramblings.  She's fine, so behave.
-- Homer, attuned to Marge's needs, "Fear of Flying"

% That night, in bed, Homer is awakened by hammering.  He rolls over,
% sees Marge isn't there, goes to the window, and opens it.

Homer: Marge, it's 3 a.m.!  Shouldn't you be baking?
Marge: In a little while.
-- Marge hammers shingles at night, "Fear of Flying"

% The next day, as Marge sits on the couch, the family approaches her.

 Lisa: Mom, can we talk to you?
Marge: Can't talk.  Keeping myself in a state of catlike readiness.
 Lisa: Uh, neat.
-- "Fear of Flying"

   Lisa: Anyway, Mom, maybe you should go into therapy.
  Marge: No, I don't need therapy, I'm fine.  And it's too expensive.
  Homer: And I don't believe in it!  It breaks up families, turns wives
         against husbands, children against fathers, neighbors against
         me.  You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an
         hour to get top-notch therapy.
          [at KBBL]
Psychic: Hello, "Radio Psychic".  You will die a terrible, terrible
         death.
  Marge: [on the phone] [gasps]
Psychic: Ooh, I'm sorry!  That was our last caller.  OK, I'm getting
         something now.  Hmm.  OK, you will die a terrible, terrible
         death.
  Marge: But I --
     DJ: Thank you for calling "Radio Psychic".  Do you have a song
         request?
  Homer: [running to the phone] "It's Raining Men"!
-- Homer "Waylon" Simpson, "Fear of Flying"

% At the VHS Village, Homer chooses some videos to help Marge out.

   Homer: Now Marge, "Dear Abby" says seeing films about air travel can
          calm your fears.  Ooh!  Here are some upbeat titles: "Hero",
          "Fearless"..."Alive!"
           [at home, Marge watches them]
   Man 1: No thanks to the plane, many of us are still...
Everyone: Alive!
   Man 2: [through full mouth] We certainly are.  [chews]
   Man 3: Pass me another hunk of copilot.
    Lisa: Dad, Mom's getting worse.  You have to take her to see a real
          psychiatrist.  Look how tense she is!
   Homer: She's fine!
           [camera shows Marge sitting on air]
          Oh.
-- Rigid, not tense, "Fear of Flying"

% The family take her to a psychiatrist the next day.

Homer: [sarcastic] All right, Lisa, you got your way.  Your Mom's going
       to a psychiatrist.  She's going to tell Marge to leave me.  It'll
       break up the family and you'll have to live with your grandmother
       and pick beans.
 Lisa: Dad, I like picking beans with Gramma.
Homer: Well, keep it up, then.
 Lisa: [sarcastic] OK, I will.
Homer: Good.  You do that.
 Lisa: Fine.
Homer: You'll be picking many a bean.
 Lisa: Hope I do.
-- Homer gives his kids sarcasm lessons, "Fear of Flying"

% Bart espies Principal Skinner reading a "Principal's World" magazine.

   Bart: I don't believe it!  Principal Skinner.  Well, well, well, I
         never thought I'd win _this_ easy.
Skinner: Hmph.  This has nothing to do with you, Simpson.  I have many,
         many issues with my beloved smother -- mother.
  Homer: Bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down.
   Bart: [abashed] OK.
          [Homer laughs at Skinner, makes crazy noises at him]
-- Homer, sensitive to mental illness, "Fear of Flying"

% Homer and Marge meet the psychiatrist.

Homer: All right, how much do you charge?
Zweig: If money's a problem, I charge on a sliding scale.  I can go as
       low as $30 an hour.
Homer: Keep sliding.
Marge: $30 will be fine.
Homer: Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa!  First, what are your qualifications?
Zweig: Well -- [she motions to a wall of diplomas]
Homer: Oh, no.  I'm not here to take a reading test.  I want to see some
       credentials.
Marge: Mph, I'm sorry, Doctor, he's just afraid you'll blame all my
       problems on him.
Zweig: I'm not here to blame anyone.
        [she double-underlines "Husband" on a pad of paper]
-- The first meeting with Dr. Zweig, "Fear of Flying"

Zweig: Marge, therapy can be an intense process.
Marge: Uh huh...
Zweig: We're going to delve deeply into your subconscious and we're not
       going to stop until we've exposed the root of your fear of
       flying.
Marge: Mmm...
Zweig: Don't worry.  This is a private sanctuary where whatever
       transpires will be just between us.
        [Homer, dressed as a window washer, appears at the window]
Marge: Huh?
Zweig: Oh, that's just Murray the window washer.  He comes every day at
       12:00.
Marge: But it's a few seconds before 12:00.
        [Murray drops down on Homer, knocking him off]
-- Marge's first session, "Fear of Flying"

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:30]
%
% Marge comes out of a therapy session to be greeted by Homer.

Homer: Ever since you started therapy, all you can do is talk about
       yourself.  Well what about _me_, Marge?
Marge: I just left my first session and I haven't even opened my mouth
       yet!
Homer: You see?  You see?  "_I_ just left _my_ first session and _I_
       haven't opened _my_ mouth yet".
-- Homer traps Marge, "Fear of Flying"

% At Marge's next session...

Zweig: Marge, there's no simple explanation for your fear of flying.
       But it can probably be traced to some childhood trauma.  Think
       back...what's the earliest memory you have of something bad
       happening?
Marge: Hmm...that would have to be my first day of school.
        [flashback]
Patty: They got this thing called a "fire drill".  They use it to drill
       a flaming hole in your head.
Marge: Mmm...
Selma: And there's only one big toilet, and they make you all go at the
       same time.  [laughs]
-- The sensitive Bouvier twins, "Fear of Flying"

Marge: [voice over] The kids at school were even worse.
        [young Marge gets on the bus, sits next to a girl]
 Girl: [seeing her lunch pail] Ew!  You like the Monkees?  You _know_
       they don't write their own songs.
Marge: They do so!
 Girl: They don't even play their own instruments.
Marge: No...no!
 Girl: That's not even Michael Nesmith's real hat.
Marge: Aah!
        [back in the present]
Zweig: Kids can be so cruel.
Marge: But it's true.  They didn't write their own songs _or_ play their
       own instruments.
Zweig: The Monkees weren't about music, Marge.  They were about
       rebellion, about political and social upheaval!
        [Marge smiles, relieved]
-- Dr. Zweig does her job, "Fear of Flying"

% The family watches TV that night.

Homer: [sullen] Did you talk about me in therapy today?
Marge: I don't think so.
Homer: Tell me the truth!  [gasps] Don't tell her I raised my voice.
       [laughs nervously] Happy family, happy family...
-- "Fear of Flying"

% In the next therapy session...

Marge: I keep having the same dream.  I'm the mother from "Lost in
       Space".
        [scene shift to Marge's dream]
Marge: Ready for breakfast, Dr. Smith?
Homer: Oh, being stuck on this godforsaken planet has vanquished what
       little appetite I have.  [sits down, mows down]
 Lisa: [as a robot] Warning.  Warning.  Dr. Smith refuses to do his
       astrochores.
Homer: Why, you clattering clank of cogs and -- my fair lady, as you
       well know, my back is a disaster area.  Oh, the pain.  Oh, the
       pain of it all!
 Lisa: Danger.  Danger.  My hook are flailing wildly.
        [a rocket takes off]
Marge: Wait!  Wait, Daddy, please don't leave.  Take me with you!
        [back to the office]
Zweig: Marge, are you aware you just said "Please don't leave" to your
       daddy?
Marge: No I didn't.
Zweig: Yes you did.  And you also infringed on any number of copyrights.
-- Dr. Zweig, psychiatric lawyer, "Fear of Flying"

Zweig: Now...let's talk about your father.
Marge: [hurried] Sure.  OK, I'll talk about father...Father Christmas.
       That's what they call Santa Claus in England.  They drive on the
       wrong side of the road there.  Now _that's_ crazy.  [laughs
       nervously] People are always saying how small England is but you
       couldn't fit it all in here, not by a long shot.  [laughs again]
       You know what?  I'm cured.  [gets up to leave]
Zweig: Marge, get back here and tell me about your father.
Marge: OK.  OK, but you're going to make a big deal out of this.  He was
       a pilot.
Zweig: A pilot?!  This _is_ a big deal.
Marge: You see?
-- Self-fulfilling prophecies., "Fear of Flying"

% Dr. Zweig laughs nervously.

Zweig: Er, Marge, this may not be the best time to bring this up, but,
       uh, your last check bounced.
Marge: Wait, I'm remembering something.
Zweig: Yes, Marge, there's still the matter of --
Marge: I was a little girl...
        [flashback to Marge holding Daddy's hand]
Daddy: Goodbye, Margie.  Be a good girl, now.  [gets on plane]
Marge: Why does Daddy have to leave?
Mommy: Because he's a pilot.  He flies all over the world.
Marge: I want to see Daddy fly.  [runs up plane steps]
Mommy: Margie!  No, come back!
        [Marge gets inside, looks around]
Marge: Daddy?  Daddy, where are --
Daddy: [a steward] So, who wants pre-flight cookie?  Fig Newtons?
       Hydrox?
Marge: Daddy?  Aah!
Daddy: Don't look at me.  Don't look at me!
-- The shameful truth comes out, "Fear of Flying"

% Back in the present...

Marge: [weeping] My father was a stewardess!
Zweig: Marge, there's nothing to be ashamed of here.  Today, male flight
       attendants or "stewards" are common.
Marge: They are?
Zweig: Yes, thanks to trailblazers like your father.  You might say he
       was a pioneer.
Marge: Yeah...you might even say he was an American hero.
Zweig: Let's not go nuts.
-- Too late, "Fear of Flying"

% Dr. Zweig concludes, "The important thing is that we've pinpointed the
% precise moment when you developed your fear of flying."  But Marge
% starts remembering some other stuff.  As a baby, she remembers her
% grandmother trying to feed her with a spoon, saying "Here comes the
% airplane" but taking a long time to put the spoon in baby's mouth.  As
% a young girl, a toy plane she was riding in caught fire.  Her mother
% takes her to a cornfield once, when a biplane swoops down and fires
% its machine guns at her.

Marge: Do you think those things could also have contributed to my fear
       of flying?
Zweig: [brusque] Yes, yes, it's all a rich tapestry.
Marge: Oh, well, thank you doctor.  You've changed my life!
Zweig: You know, Marge, we've really just begun to scratch the surface.
       There's still the far more serious problem of your husband.
Homer: [walking in] That's OK, you don't have to make her into some kind
       of superwoman.  She can get on a plane, that's plenty.  [rushes
       Marge out]
Marge: Thank you, doctor.  Whenever the wind whistles through the
       leaves, I'll think "Lowenstein", "Lowenstein".
Zweig: My name is Zweig.
Marge: [whispering] Lowenstein...
-- Marge the old honeydripper, "Fear of Flying"

% The family finally get on a plane together.

Homer: Don't worry about a thing, honey.  I'm going to help you through
       this.
        [he and Marge sit down; some noises occur]
       Those are all normal noises.  Luggage compartment closing...cross
       checking...just sit back and relax.
        [shot from outside the plane]
       That's just the engine powering up...that's just the engine
       struggling...
        [the plane drives off the runway into a swamp]
       That's just a carp swimming around your ankles...
Marge: Mmm...
-- Not much help allaying those fears, "Fear of Flying"
