   [If you use these summaries to determine if you found the right capsule,
   here's a TV Guide-like synopsis:  Love is in session for Principal Skinner
   and Edna Krabappel, but it's a secret known only to them -- and Bart.  --

==============================================================================
> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Couch:          Five clear, blue balloons, shaped like each member of the
                family, float down onto the couch.  They take place -- with a
                little squeaking -- and then pop.  [Recycled from 4F05]  {hl}

-  The colors are reversed on Mrs. Krabappel's globe -- the ocean should be

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  An ill-conceived premise, predictably developed, and
   brought to a familiar conclusion.  Yet, there were several enjoyable
   moments, and the whole enterprise was quite well-executed.  Another fine
   performance from Marcia Wallace.  (C+)

Richard Bunnell:  This episode had very few low points, the only one being the
   Skinner- Krabappel dance scene, but they didn't stretch that part too far.
   Everything else was top-notch Simpsons humor, with another great Ralph
   line.  I also liked the way the ending made it seem like things were going
   to revert to normal, but then actually appeared to be the same. "Ha, those
   kids, they believe anything you tell them."  (A)

Jesse Burgheimer:  Maybe not the best episode of Season 8, but a good one
   none-the-less.  I enjoyed the unlikely romance between Principal Skinner
   and Ms. Krabappel, because they just happen to be the least social
   characters of the show.
      This episode also had a decent ending for once, without the usual
   guillotine chop that most eps end with (like "Sideshow Bob's Last
   Gleaming").  After all, we all DID know that Skinner was still pure, didn't
   we?  (B)

Vince Chan:  This episode wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  It was one
   of those mediocre episodes where what happens is easily forgotten.  There
   were a few memorable lines and scenes.  The episode, overall, was your
   average 8th season episode.  (B)

Don Del Grande:  It was a little slow at the ends, but how many ways are there
   of ending a "secret love discovered" story (and Rachel did take a "typical
   twisted Simpsons ending" (having them break up) and go one better (no,
   people just THINK we broke up), even if this is probably the last time
   we'll see them "together".  (B)

Timothy Goddard:  An excellent effort, considering that the episode used the
   Simpson family very little (with the exception of Bart).  A good example of
   a case where the writers were able to rely primarily on minor characters
   throughout the duration of the episode with encouraging results.
   Furthermore, despite the relative lack of Homer, the few instances where he
   did make an appearance were hilarious.  I really laughed at the spaceship
   scene.  (B+)

Jonathan Haas:  Not much to say about this one, except that it was a mediocre
   episode in what's shaped up to be a mediocre season.  From the rake scene
   right at the beginning, this one wasn't terrible, it just wasn't *funny*.
   "Boring" is probably the adjective that describes it best. Few if any real
   laughs.  Even Ralph Wiggum was nothing but a rehash. Where's the
   originality that's supposed to be a hallmark of the Simpsons? This one was
   nowhere near as crapulent as "My Sister, My Sitter", but boy, it wasn't
   good.  (C-)

Jason Hancock:  A rather dull episode that seemed to recycle an old premise
   (Mrs. Krabappel falling in love) and a few old gags.  It moved rather
   slowly, but the third act was better than the first two.  (C)

Haynes Lee:  This episode started on the premise of everything being boring
   but unfortunately it stayed that way.  Only Nelson's ha-ha at Skinner being
   a 44 year-old virgin (and Krabappel's rebuttal to Homer) made me laugh. The
   worst this season.  Yech.  (D-)

Ondre Lombard:  A bright spot in the season.  Humorously disastrous love
   stories are always good, and it's nice to see them give Skinner character
   other than being Mama's Little Boy.  Hightlights: the kids blowing Skinner
   and Krabappel's kiss out of proportion, and the very nice ending.  (B)

Werner Peeters:  Martin Prince having a birthday party?  That's hilarious in
   its own right. The jokes about the oysters, Milhouse barfing and the donkey
   tail game were superb.  The most funny moments of this episode were due
   though to the supporting characters: Agnes Skinner and of course Ralph
   Wiggum.  The scene where he's explaining about the babies is another
   classic (I love that kid!).  Too bad the episode ended rather abruptly - so
   Skinner is a virgin, eh?  Well well well, who'd have thought?  and suddenly
   all the fuss is over. The scene where they drag Bart half sleeping to the
   cinema is memorable though.  (B)

Mark Aaron Richey:  We always knew Seymour Skinner and Edna Krabappel were
   made for each other, and this episode touchingly and romantically proves
   it.  The surprising thing is how willing Bart is to go along with the
   deception, at least until the two of them (unwittingly) pushed him over the
   breaking point.  The third act put a lovely twist on an ancient cliche.
   Granted, the non-Bart members of OFF were slighted (when Martin receives
   more screen time than Homer, Marge, and Lisa put together, there's
   something wrong), but I was willing to overlook that.  A very good episode.
   (A-)

Donni Saphire-Bernstein:  It seems to me that unlike the old rapscallion Bart
   used to be, he's getting somewhat responsible in his old age- i.e. not
   breaking the agreement until he felt forced to by social pressure.  I was
   expecting him to go right ahead and tell everyone.  The ending pulled a
   neat double-whammy; once again, like in 4F04, the show takes the classic
   sitcom ending and turns it upside down.  Aside from these referential
   notes, there were lots of great laughs.  Let's see: Homer looking for the
   remote, Kent Brockman being had, Mrs. Skinner entertaining Bart with her
   cake scrapbook, the "mathemagician", and more. There could have been more
   irony and humor in this episode, though...I feel as if they didn't do as
   much as they could have with the situation.  (B+)

Marge Starbrod-Simpson:  A promising premise made for the worst episode ever
   (tied with 4F04). The birthday party and the standoff were the suckiest
   scenes I've ever seen (no pun intended), and Bart's role seemed like
   nothing more that something the writers put in to keep us from bitching
   about OFF's lack of screentime (like we did last year with 3F15).  That and
   that fact that I don't know which makes me wanna wretch more- this ep or
   4F04.  (F)

Yours Truly:  Skinner and Krabappel make for a natural couple, and their
   relationship is realized nicely in this episode.  Too bad it was weighed
   down by a too-nice Bart in the final act, and some plot holes observable
   from Mars.  (C+)

>> Ever get the feeling you're being watched?

Art imitates life, according to Benjamin Robinson:  Several months before this
   episode aired, there was a thread on a.t.s.  asking which two single
   Springfieldians would make the best couple.  Mr. Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel
   were one of the pairings.

   Later, Rick "Mountain Man" Senger started a thread that sought to sort out
   the adults in Springfield who have had conjugal relations from those who
   hadn't.  Now we know for sure on which side of the fence Skinner falls.

   Perhaps someday we'll learn what the "J" in Homer J. Simpson means.

   [This was written long before the network's announcement that we will
   indeed learn what the "J" means next season -- Ed.]


>> Marge Simpson predicts!

Well, Marge Starbrod-Simpson, anyway.  She notices a pattern manifesting
   itself in this episode:  Somehow, I saw this ep coming before ever seeing
   the episode list for this season.  In many a show, a male character has an
   attractive female costar.  You'd think the two were dating, only to be
   proved wrong when almost all they do is feud for the next several seasons,
   or avoid each other completely.  Finally, in a very late season, they hook
   up at last.  It happened with Mark and Vanessa in "Hangin' with Mr.
   Cooper", Helen and Joe in "Wings", and Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel
   in "The Simpsons", just to name a few.


>> Writer Watch

Dale G. Abersold:  Rachel Pulido's only previous writing effort for the show
   was as one of the many co-writers of "22 Short Films About Springfield"
   [3F18].

   [Mr. Abersold must agree that brevity is the soul of wit -- Ed.]


>> And take this tape with you on your next trip to the moon

Benjamin Robinson:  The president that Homer imitates is obviously Richard
   Nixon.  My guess is that Homer's remembering the Apollo missions to the
   moon.  Nixon was president when Apollo 11 landed there, and would be the
   person giving the congratulatory phone call. (Later, Nixon would scrap the
   Apollo program, drawing NASA's Golden Era to a close.)


>> Tom Berenger capsule festival

Mark Aaron Richey:  Tom Berenger -- Actor (and University of Missouri alum),
   who got an Oscar nomination for his performance in 1986's "Platoon", and
   has spent the last ten years starring in mostly "B"-movies.


Dallas J. Pesola:  The movie that Edna and Seymour went to watch was most
   likely "The Big Chill".  Tom Berenger stars in the 1983 movie that was
   filmed in Atlanta.  [You'll recall that superintendent Chalmers mentions
   that it has Tom Berenger and asks Bart if it was really filmed in Atlanta"]


>> Another use for "Songs in the Key of Springfield"

Benjamin Robinson:  Manuel Noriega was head honcho in Panama and wanted to
   stay that way.  The United States felt that he threatened American
   interests in that area, and wanted him out.  Things came to a head, and the
   Americans dispatched troops to capture him. Noriega holed up in a monastery
   [Well, close.  It was the Papal Nuncio -- Ed.].  Not wanting to tromp into
   holy ground, or violate sanctuary, or something, the Americans devised an
   unusual plan.  As the rest of the world (and most of America, as well)
   looked on, bemused, they decided to force him out by playing loud annoying
   music at all hours of the night. The authorities have employed the loud
   music gambit in other situations involving cornered suspects, with mixed
   results.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Fast Times at Springfield
   Elementary


Three items, courtesy of Mark Aaron Richey:  "High School Confidential" --
   forgettable movie from the late '50's, based on a Jerry Lee Lewis song (he
   makes a cameo appearance in the film) about a juvenile delinquent who gets
   involved with drugs at his new school.

   Oysters -- There is a serious risk that by consuming uncooked oysters (and
   most oysters are uncooked), one will also consume a dangerous and possibly
   deadly bacteria.

   Armour Hot Dogs -- A hot dog brand mostly known for its catchy jingle,
   which Chalmers nicely paraphrased.  The jingle was actually used for a
   production number in [1F21] "Lady Bouvier's Lover".


Marge Starbrod-Simpson:  The reason I brought up the p-code order thing before
   is because, if this ep proved anything, there's probably a reason for that.
   In 4F14 ["The Brother from Another Series"], for example, we saw Edna on a
   date with SSB.  At the end of 4F09 ["Grade School Confidential"], however,
   she's still seeing Skinner.  Had these eps run in production order... well,
   you get the idea.  And let's not forget the divorce in 4F04 ["A Milhouse
   Divided"], and that they were together at the party scene in 4F05 ["Burns,
   Baby, Burns"] and at the town meeting in 4F06 ["Bart After Dark"] (plus
   Kirk was a lot less annoying).

Krabappel: What Seymour's, oh, what Principal Skinner means to say,
           Bart, is that sometimes a little boy's imagination can run
           away with him.
Bart:      That's the best you can do?  You could have at least said
           that you were giving her CPR or rehearsing a play.
Skinner:   Is it too late to say that?
Bart:      [nods] Mmm-hmm.
Krabappel: We're just a little concerned, that if people were to find
           out that a principal were dating a teacher, they might see

Krabappel: That's okay.  I don't entertain much.  Usually it's just
           soup for one, salad for one, wine for three.

           just like mother, even though I didn't want to.  And now

           of here so fast your mortarboards will spin.  And where is
           your mortarboard, anyway?
Skinner:   Uh, right here, sir.  [retrieves it and puts it on, sending
           a cloud of dust flying]
Chalmers:  So, what'll it be, Seymour?
Skinner:   Well, I'm sorry but uh, I can't give up the woman I love.
Chalmers:  Well, then I'm afraid you leave me no choice.  I want you
           out of the building by three o'clock.  You're fired.  Edna,
           too.
Skinner:   [gasps]
-- Guess what, honey!  I got us both canned, "Grade School
   Confidential"

% Mrs. Krabappel gives her farewell address to the class

Krabappel: Well, it's going to be hard to say goodbye to all of you.
           We've had a lot of fun together.  [walks through the rows
           of students] Nelson, Nelson, Nelson.  How many kids have
           you beaten up this year?
Nelson:    [shrugs] I dunno; fifty.
Krabappel: Ah, fifty.  Where does the time go?
-- Goodbye, Mrs. Chips -er- Krabappel, "Grade School Confidential"

% Bart is called to the principal's office one last time, and Skinner --
% now shorn of his Principal's title, apologizes to Bart for all the
% awkward situations.  He gathers his belonging and goes to the door,
% but Bart stops him.  "Just this once, man, stand up for yourself," he
% says.  The advice gives Skinner a new resolve.

We're not going anywhere.  I'm going to do what Bart should have told
me to do a long time ago.
-- Principal Skinner, "Grade School Confidential"

% Skinner, Edna, and Bart stand their ground.  Or rather, they stand on
% the roof of Springfield Elementary.  Skinner announces, using a
% bullhorn, that the trio isn't coming down until he gets what he wants.
% But he can't even arouse the attention of his former staff.

Willie hears ya.  Willie don't care.
-- Groundskeeper Willie, "Grade School Confidential"

% Bart, who is more experienced in scene-causing, takes command and
% files a false octopus sighting with Channel 6 news.  Soon, Kent
% Brockman is on the scene from the Channel 6 news chopper.

So, once again, I've been had.  But an even more interesting story has
developed high atop this two-story school -- a love story.
-- Kent Brockman, "Grade School Confidential"

% A large crowd watches as Chalmers tries to talk Skinner down.

Chalmers:  [through bullhorn] Skinner, get off of my school.
Skinner:   No, you get off of my school.
Marge:     Homer, Bart's up there!
Homer:     [taking bullhorn from Chalmers] Gimmie that.
           [through bullhorn] Bart, this is your father.  Do you know
           where the remote is?  I looked all over the house.
Bart:      Did you check your pockets?
Homer:     [checks, and find that the remote was in his back pocket all
           along]
           [through the bullhorn to Marge] It was ...
           [lowers bullhorn] ... it was in my pocket.
-- Marge should've gotten him the hostage negotiation tape, after all,
"Grade School Confidential"

% Chief Wiggum tries to use reverse psychology on the fugitives, but it
% doesn't work.  So he goes to plan B:  A sound truck capable of
% blasting "Embracable You" at concert volume.  Skinner and Krabappel
% take advantage of the opportunity to do a little slow-dancing, much to
% Bart's chagrin.  Wiggum, thinking the tactic is working, trains a
% floodlight on the school.  Inside, a colander splits the light, giving
% the cafeteria were Skinner and Krabappel are dancing a nightclub
% atmosphere.
%
% The next morning, a telephone crashes through the window.  Its
% ringing awakens Skinner.

Skinner:   [casually] I'll get it.  [picks up receiver] Talk to me.
Chalmers:  You have got to end this thing, Seymour.
Skinner:   We're not coming down until our jobs are reinstated and you
           acknowledge and celebrate our love.
Chalmers:  No one would like to celebrate your love more than I, but
           I'm a public servant, and not permitted to use my own
           judgement in any way.
Krabappel: [taking phone] Then let us take our case directly to the
           townspeople.
Chalmers:  Oh, yeah, that'll be -real- productive.  Who do you want to
           talk to first?  The, the guy with a bumblebee suit, or the
           one with a bone through his hair?
Mel:       My opinions are as valid as the next man's!
Chalmers:  Yeah, all right.  Just come on down.
-- "Grade School Confidential"

% Before Skinner heads down to plead his case, Bart suggests that he
% first grab the people's attention.  Cut to a shot of the school's main
% entrance.  Skinner [and Krabappel and Bart [?]] emerges, and announces
% he has a bomb.  Opening his jacket, he reveals what appear to be
% several sticks of dynamite strapped to his chest.  Chief Wiggum
% quickly notices that the "sticks" are really hot dogs, and Skinner
% drops the charade (and the dogs).

Krabappel:     Just speak from the heart, Seymour.  Tell them how we
               brought a little happiness into each others' lives.  Ask
               them why they're forcing two dedicated people to choose
               between their careers and their hearts.
Mrs. Flanders: Excuse me Edna, I don't think were talking about love
               here.  We're talking about S-E-X.  In front of the C-H-I-
               L-D-R-E-N.
Krusty:        Sex Cauldron!  I thought they closed that place down.
-- Keep up those spelling lessons, Krusty, "Grade School Confidential"

% Skinner asks what is going on.  Various members of the crowd respond
% tell him they heard that Skinner and Krabappel were having "sordid
% public sexual congress" in the closet.

Skinner:   This is absurd!  I did not have relations in that closet
           and the fact is I haven't ... [hesitates] um ...
Chalmers:  Yes?
Krabappel: Seymour, I think you'd better tell them.  It's the only way
           to clear our names.
Skinner:   Well, everyone, the fact is, I haven't ever had relations.
           I am a virgin.
           [the crowd is stunned]
Nelson:    Ha - ha!
Homer:     Hey, does this mean that Mrs. Krabappel is a virgin, too?
Krabappel: [offscreen] Ha!
-- Let's not push it, "Grade School Confidential"

% Superintendent Chalmers decides to back down.

Chalmers:  Well, it's clear you've been falsely accused.  Because no
           one, anywhere, ever, would pretend to be a 44-year-old
           virgin.
           [the crowd walks off]
Krusty:    Oh, that's for sure.
Hibbert:   I'm, uh, I'm inclined to agree.
Willie:    Ach!  I'll never look at him the same again.
Lenny:     That was more than I wanted to know.
Chalmers:  [clears throat] Okay, well um, Edna, Seymour, in light of
           these uh, uh, revelations, I uh, suppose we uh,
           overreacted.
Krabappel: Do we have our jobs back?
Chalmers:  What?  Oh yes, yes, sure.  Just uh, you know, keep the
           lewdness to a minimum.  [hurries off]
-- Uncompromising standards, "Grade School Confidential"

% Relieved, Skinner, Krabappel, and Bart return to the school.  Bart
% gets his things out of the locker and begins to head home.

Bart:      I'm outta here.  Skinny, Krabby, catch ya later.
Skinner:   Uh, hold on, Bart.  May we have a word with you?
Krabappel: We want to thank you for helping us through a difficult
           period.
Bart:      Oh, no problemo.  So I guess now you'll be getting married
           or something, huh?
Krabappel: Well, actually, Seymour and I have decided to break up.
Bart:      Huh?
Skinner:   Mm.  We can't continue on like this, trying to build a
           private relationship in public, the whole town watching our
           every move with a fine-toothed comb.
Krabappel: Mmm-hmm.  I'm used to humiliation but not in front of a
           crowd that size.
Bart:      Aw, but you seemed like such a good couple.
Krabappel: Bart.  When you get a little older you're going to learn
           that sometimes romances don't turn out exactly the way
           you'd like them to.
Bart:      [sighs and trudges out of the building]
Skinner:   That's why I love elementary school, Edna.  The children
           believe anything you tell them.
-- "Grade School Confidential"

% Skinner produces some champagne, and he and Edna repair to the
% janitor's closet.  Before we fade to black, we hear a cork pop and the
% loving couple laugh heartily.  True love has triumphed again.
