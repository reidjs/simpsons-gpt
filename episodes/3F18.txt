> "TV Guide" Synopsis
=======================================================================

    Interconnecting vignettes depict various moments in the lives of
    Springfield residents, including Apu's partying activities;
    Smithers' allergic reaction to a bee sting; and Dr. Nick Riviera's

> Opening Sequence
=======================================================================

>> COUCH SCENE

      Everybody is a sea monkey (except for mermaid Maggie) and swims
      to a couch made of clams to look at a treasure chest instead of
      a TV.  The treasure chest opens to reveal diamonds.

=======================================================================
> Animation, Continuity, and other Goofs
=======================================================================

- An animation glitch occurs when Apu grabs the tofu dog; for one
  frame, a part of his head is pushed downward.  {jl}

= One of Lisa's hair spikes was split in one shot but in the next shot
  looks normal again.  {jl}

+ Smithers was stung by a bee in 8F09 and suffered no ill effects.
  {vm}

= Dr. Riviera leaves the door open, but when he defends the charge of
  misuse of cadavers, the door is closed.  {jl}

= Chalmers should know how to get to Skinner's house.  (See 3F12.)

= Chalmers takes a burger but Skinner doesn't.  Even if Skinner did
  have one, there should be two burgers left on the platter.  But
  there's only one.  (And there's a lot less fries)  {jl}

* Springfield Volunteer Fire Department's initials are "SPFD".  {jl}

+ I thought the Springfield Shopper was free (not 25 cents), and I 
  thought it was delivered to OFF's house.  {jh}

= When Homer pulls Maggie's baggie off, he's grabbing it by the bottom,
  but when it comes off, he's suddenly holding it by the arms.  {ddg}

c Captions read "( thumping on glass )" for Maggie when she's not
  doing anything.

+ In the "Where's Daddy?" game it should have been Homer hiding behind
  a sheet (however, Lisa learned to do her own diapers [2F15]).

* If Krusty Burger is indeed much like McDonalds, why are their burgers
  grilled?  {jl}

+ Bumblebee Man has spoken English off camera before (and pretty well,
  I might add; see 1F11).  {jh}

* Spanish Bee man cannot be electrocuted by a single spaghetti strand
  because of no return path for the current.  {hl}

c When Pedro the Bee suffers his accidents at home, captions say the
  radio plays "La Cucaracha" when it is playing the Mexican Hat Dance.
  {jl}

* The Spanish is atrocious (see below).  {vm}

* When Snake knocks over the mailbox, letters appear to pour out of the
  ground as if from a geyser.  {ddg}

* Herman probably wouldn't be able to fire his double-barrel shotgun,
  which needs to be manually loaded.  {vm}

= Chief Wiggum loses his hat in the fight with Snake, but in the next
  chapter of the Herman story he has his hat back.  {jl}

* How did Milhouse get the mace and helmet w/visor in the bathroom?
  {vm}

= Herman's teeth aren't visible when he's knocked down by Milhouse,
  but in the next shot they are.  {jl}

* The barber pole in Snippy Longstockings isn't moving which normally
  means the shop is closed.  {jl}

+ The barber shop was called "Jake's Unisex Hair Palace" in previous 
  episodes, and Jake the barber sounds different (almost like Sideshow 
  Mel this time).  {jh}

* Why is Ralph further down the street than his parents?  (see FFF)
  {jh}

+ Jasper supposedly got a nose job but he's seen with his regular nose.
  {vm}

+ Although Frink says the monkeys stole his glasses, he is, in fact, 
  wearing them.  {rs}

=======================================================================
> Comments and other observations
=======================================================================

>> Before there was Martha Stewart... {bjr}

...there was `Helpful Hints with Heloise,' or something like that.  As
    a women's columnist, Heloise offered simple, but counter-intuitive,
    hints on how to keep that house looking great.  This is probably
    who Marge is referring to when she says, `If I remember my
    Heloise.'

>> Son of Car Watch

Benjamin Robinson says, "Unless you've just arrived here from Mars, you
    know that the tall man at the end of the show drives a Volkswagen
    Beetle.  These two stories seem apropos:

     - VW had an ad showing Wilt Chamberlain [sic] trying -- and
       failing -- to get into a Beetle.  The headline:  `They said it
       couldn't be done.  It couldn't.'  The copy said, essentially,
       `Even though Wilt the Stilt won't fit, you probably will.'

     - One basketball star -- think it may have been Manute Bol --
       drove a Beetle before he made the big time.  To fit, he took out
       the driver's seat, and drove from the back seat!

    Snake, as usual, is driving one of his endless supply of 1969 Dodge
    Chargers.  He must get them from the same bottomless well that
    Maggie gets her pacifiers."

>> Theme Music

      "Skinner & The Superintendent"

	 Skinner, with his crazy explanations
	 The superintendent's gonna need his medication
	 When he hears Skinner's lame exaggerations
	 There'll be trouble in town tonight.

      "Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel"

	 Some folk'll never eat a skunk
	 But then again some folk'll
	 Like Cletus
	 The slack jawed yokel.

	 Most folk'll never lose a toe
	 And then again some folk'll
	 Like Cletus
	 The slack jawed yokel.

      "The Tomfoolery of Professor John Frink"

	 N-hey, n-hey
	 Professor Frink, Professor Frink
	 He'll make you laugh, he'll make you think
	 He likes to run
	 And then the thing with the...
	 um, person...

>> How many short films, again?

Benjamin Robinson says, "I counted the stories (c'mon, you knew
    _someone_ was going to), and ended up with eighteen.  (That's
    counting the three parts of Lisa's bad hair day as three stories,
    and including Prof. Frink's abortive attempt at tale-spinning.)  So
    someone slipped up, right?  Maybe not.  In octal (base-8)
    numbering, 18 is 22.  People with four fingers per hand would most
    likely count in octal.  So the title could be a sly meta-reference!
    Or maybe someone just miscounted, after all."

I counted twenty-two, counting the outtaked "Marge the Hostage" and
    "Ralphplane!"   My counting included Dr. Nick's board review and
    Grampa's insanity as two stories.

>> Yet More Antiquated Burns Jokes

Haynes Lee gives the meanings of Burns' insults to Smithers, from the
    Oxford English Dictionary:

      - SHIRKADAY: "shirk" means to avoid work.
      - MEPHITIC: to emit a foul-smelling or poisonous stench.
      - FLANGE: a projecting flat rim, collar, or rib, used for
		strengthening or attachment.
      - DISCOMBOBULATED (from Grampa): U.S. jocular for disturbed,
				       disconcerted.

>> Maybe Tito Puente and Celia Cruz should have guest starred.

Veronica Marquez notes, "The Spanish in this episode is atrocious,
    sounding more like a translation of English dialogue into Spanish
    than real Spanish.  And worse, there's no such word as `wudpequero'
    in Spanish.  Of course it takes a fluent Spanish speaker like 
    myself to understand what I mean.

    "For the record, Pedro said: `Oh, what a terrible day at work.
    First, the attack of the crazy woodpecker.  Then, a disaster of
    electricity.  And finally, a catastrophe with a baseball.' Then,
    `Ah, time to relax in peace and quiet.  Ow, oranges on the head!
    Ow, a precarious chandelier.'  Then the woman says `Look at the
    terrible thing I don't understand how this know how I can live
    with a man so irresponsible.  No, no no no no!'  (Hey, don't ask
    me what that should mean.)  Then, Pedro says (the only acceptable
    Spanish here) `Oh, where's my tequila?'  And most legal statements
    in the United States are done in English regardless of the language
    spoken.  You'd find better Spanish on bilingual applications."

    I think the awful Spanish made it funnier, but that's just me.
    Diff'rent strokes, it takes diff'rent strokes to move the world...
    ahem.

>> Moe the Speakeasy

Mark Richey notes that Moe was a former speakeasy.  Speakeasies are
    bars that sold alcohol illegally during the prohibition.  If a
    raid happened, the owners of the speakeasy would slip into an
    alcove behind bulletproof glass and lock themselves in to avoid
    getting shot or arrested.  Keep in mind that Moe is apparently
    pretty old since he was one of the original Little Rascals.

>> Name that episode!

Benjamin Robinson notes, "This is one of only four episodes broadcast
    with its title.  So you don't go crazy wondering what the other
    three were, they're:  `The Telltale Head (7G07),' `Episode 23: Bart
    Gets Hit by a Car (7F10),' and, `The Simpsons 138th Episode
    Spectacular (3F31).'"

>> Van Heflin

He is actor from "a bygone era".  Tom Baker provides a small biography
    from Halliwell's "Filmgoer's Companion":

    "Heflin, Van (1910-1971) (Emmett Evan Heflin).
    Purposeful American leading man of the forties, craggy character
    actor of the fifties and sixties."

Tom Baker adds that Heflin had a skinny and sharp nose.  "I see that
    his movies include `Santa Fe Trail' (with Ronald Reagan), `Green
    Dolphin Street', `Shane', `The Greatest Story Ever Told', and
    `Airport'."

=======================================================================

Dale Abersold - An instant classic!  Here's to Our Favorite Writers for
    giving us this wonderfully kinetic portrait of Our Favorite City.
    The great moments are too numerous to mention, but the Van Houtens
    in Herman's store, Lisa's new hairstyle, and Nelson's comeuppance
    were highlights.  Grade: A+.  Best of the season.

Erik Berliner - This was a hilarious episode.  For an episode really
    lacking plot, it held together reasonably well.  The Lisa sub-plot
    was okay, and the idea behind the story was good, but the Pulp
    Fiction references put this over the top.  The cops in the diner
    had my brother and I cracking up, and it only got better from
    there.  One of the best episodes of the season.  A+

James Cherry [we finally hear from my predecessor! --ed] - Brilliant.
    Just when I think they can't make an episode that outdoes the last
    brillian one (3F01), they do it.  Too many classic scenes to
    recount: Apu, Cletus, Skinner/Chalmers, Nelson, and the "Pulp
    Fiction" stuff -- I'm in awe.  Grade: A+.

Chris Courtois - "22 Short Films About Springfield" was probably the
    ultimate "wacky" episode. Just a bunch of short bits unhampered by
    plot or logic. As such, it's hard to evaluate the episode as a
    whole; it's more how one reacts to the individual parts. A few were
    quite funny (the Skinner/Superintendant sitcom; Nelson's
    comeuppance; Rev. Lovejoy's dog walk), most were so-so, a few
    seemed forced (Lisa's hair; the Pulp Fiction references, while
    amusing, existed solely for the purpose of being Pulp Fiction
    references), none were flat-out duds. One episode-wide item worthy
    of mention was the spectacular direction. The flow from story to
    story was smooth and clever.  A very interesting experiment. Like
    most sketch comedy shows, a rating is a matter of hits-to-miss
    ratio. Most of the bits were just so-so, but there were enough good
    ones to rate a B-.

Don Del Grande - C-plus - I was expecting fast-paced plotless comedy.
    What I got was the occasional chuckle in what almost makes the two
    clip shows look good.  After this episode, all I can say is "Dov'e
    mia tequila?"  (which is as close to Italian for "Donde esta mi
    tequila" as I can get without accents)

Jeff Gustafson - The writers of "The Simpsons" really outdid themselves
    with this episode.  Each scene flowed into the other quite well.
    I'd have to agree with a lot of people on this list that say the
    best part of this whole episode was the Skinner and Chalmer's part.
    A+

Jason Hancock - Well, I'll give the writers credit for trying a
    different approach to a Simpsons episode.  The only problem was
    that the "title" sequences were misleading, as they were not the
    basis for the whole act.  But we did get to see more of what
    Springfield was like.  And even though some parts (like the Nelson
    scene) were dumb, the episode was funny in other parts, especially
    Apu's party and the Bumblebee Man sequence.  Grade: B+.

Haynes Lee - I suspect this is a collection of outtakes from other
    episodes. The tall guy humiliating Nelson is a classic but the
    Skinner short was stretched way too long. The bar holdup scene was
    too short and they should have had Frink.  Grade: B-

Adam Lipkin - Well, a nice, leisurely, meandering day in the life of
    the various Springfieldianites.  Good to see.  The different
    segments were well integrated, and on the whole they were pretty
    good.  The Skinner-Chalmers dinner was my favorite. I don't think I
    liked the Pulp Fiction parody-- to my knowledge, Herman wouldn't do
    that. Nelson's comeuppance was unexpected and while not entirely
    undeserved, it was a bit extreme. Overall grade, B+.

Veronica Marquez - The Chespirito spoof was marred by hideous Spanish,
    but the others were very funny.  I give it an A-.  Now back to
    `Chespirito' :-)

John Murray - Another great episode, maybe the Simpsons is not going
    downhill, as some people seem to think.  This episode had a new and
    exciting format that provided a change that really helped this
    episode.  This combined with great lines, great gags, lotsa
    references, and a plot that doesn't get boring made for a great
    episode.  Grade: A+

Mark Richey - An interesting experiment.  Some of the segments were
    funny, some were less funny.  [...]  Overall average: B  However,
    I'm going to give it a B+ because I like the idea.

Benjamin Robinson - Slightly uneven, but if you don't like one sketch
    you can wait thirty seconds, and another will be right along.  The
    best of these stories is probably "Skinner and the Superintendent,"
    which skewers the "wacky" sitcom genre with aplomb.  Other
    highlights:  The Bee Guy's home life, which eerily parallels his
    work life; Lisa's bad hair day; Maggie's captivity in the newspaper
    box; and Nelson's comeuppance.  The Cletus story was also
    surprisingly good.  (A-)

Marcus Ronaldi - Great episode, very surreal with all of the great
    characters.  This is what I watch the Simpsons for. ****1/2

Rick Senger - One of the most up-and-down shows in it's seven year run.
    The Chalmers/Skinner segment was classic, as was Nelson's
    comeuppance by the tall geeky guy in glasses, Homer's Maggie
    Conundrum, Bumblebee Man's slapstick and Lisa's gum predicament.
    Weaker where Cleetus the Slack-Jawed Yokel and Apu in "The Jolly
    Bengali" and Riviera doing his thing in E.R.  Still, this one was
    jam-packed with jokes, references, camera angles, and good
    dialogue, so I have few complaints.  A-

Yours Truly - Very good episode.  I'm very upset that the Krusty and
    Ralph and Marge the Hostage stories didn't make it, but I liked
    most of the show (except Moe).  The Spanish was amusing because it
    was so terrible, and of course I enjoyed the Chalmers/Skinner
    portion.  I'd give it an A-.

AVERAGE GRADE: B+/A- (3.63)

Brandine: And scuff up the topless dancin' runway?  Naw, you best bring
          'em back from where you got 'em.
-- Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

% Cletus shimmies up a telephone pole, and tosses the shoes out on the
% wire.

         [on top of a telephone pole]
Cletus: Hey you know what?  I could call my ma while I'm up here.
        [yelling] Hey, maw!  Get off the dang roof!
-- Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

% The camera follows the phone wire back into The Android's Dungeon.
% There, the owner is sending out for food.  Just when he completes
% his order, Milhouse walks in with a potty emergency.  ("I'm gonna
% explode!")  He must purchase something to use the bathroom, so
% Milhouse gets with his three quarters a Hamburglar Adventure.
% Milhouse pays for the comic.  Just then, his dad comes into the
% store.  Mr. Van Houten returns for his kid and finds him buying
% comic books.  Milhouse is dragged away.
%
% Meanwhile at Herman's Military Antiques Shop, Herman has restrained
% Chief Wiggum and Snake in bondage gear, and discusses their near
% future.  "As soon as Zed gets here, the party will begin."  The door
% buzzes, but it's not Zed, just those wacky Van Houtens.  Milhouse
% still needs to use the bathroom, so Herman tells him to make it
% quick.  Over Chief Wiggum and Snake's muffled protests, Mr. VH
% reminisces about how the store used to be a pet shop.  But Herman
% will have none of it.  "Get in the corner," he orders.  But soon
% afterward, he's whacked on the head with a mace... the ball-and-
% chain kind.  He's also wearing a helmet.  Milhouse wants to buy
% this ensemble, then notices Herman unconscious on the floor.
%
% Wiggum uses the moment to hop out on his chair.  Outside, he crosses
% paths with Lisa.  She steps in the Snippy Longstocking barbershop,
% and gets into the chair.  She gets her gummy hair cut into a nice-
% looking style.

I finally look like a real person!
-- Lisa, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield" (meta-humor alert)

% Nelson does appreciate Lisa's new look -- he laughs at her ("HA-
% ha!").  Lisa sighs and replaces her wool hat.  Mrs. Glick walks by,
% trips on the curb, and winds up head-first in a trash can.  Nelson
% laughs at this, too.  An extremely tall man drives past in a VW
% Beetle, scrunched up so his knees almost bang into his head.  Nelson
% laughs.  This proves to be his undoing.  The man pulls over, unfolds
% himself from the car, and pursues Nelson.  Realizing his predicament
% ("Crud.") Nelson runs off.  The man rounds the corner, but sees only
% Lisa, and an open manhole.  Of course, the manhole is where Nelson
% is hiding.

Wadlow: [lifts Nelson out of the sewer by his head]
         Do you find something comical about my appearance when I'm
         driving my automobile?
Nelson: Yeah.
Wadlow: Everyone needs to drive a vehicle, even the very tall.
         [turns Nelson to face the car] 
        This was the largest auto that I could afford.  Am I therefore
        to be made the subject of fun?
Nelson: I guess so.
-- Nelson, unclear on the concept, 
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

% The tall guy forces Nelson to march down Main Street, pants down.  
% He drives slowly behind the ashamed bully.

Wadlow: Hey, everybody!  Look at this -- it's that boy who laughs at
        everyone.  [Nelson]  Let's laugh at him!
 Crowd: HA-ha!
-- Stupid poetic justice, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

% Ketchup and mustard rain down on Nelson.  From the bridge, Bart and
% Milhouse laugh at him.  Bart still remembers his comment from about
% 21 minutes and 10 seconds ago, and Milhouse agrees.  "Everybody in
% town's got their story to tell."  Bart notes, "There's just not
% enough time to hear them all."
%
% As if on cue, Professor John Frink tries to get in a funny story
% of his own... but he's too late.  The camera fades out on the poor
% professor, even as he tries to sing his monkey-written theme song.
