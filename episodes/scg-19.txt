[=========================[Season Nineteen Summary]=========================]

Story cut episodes: JABF20, JABF21, KABF01, KABF05, KABF08, KABF09.
                    See also JABF16.
Compressed episodes: All but JABF20, KABF08, KABF09.
Expanded episodes: JABF20, JABF21, KABF05, KABF08.
Altered content: JABF20, KABF02, KABF09.
Missing credits: JABF21, KABF05, KABF08, KABF09.
Original breaks: All but JABF20, JABF21, KABF05, KABF08, KABF09.

Total/story time cut: 2:19.5 (2 min 19.5 sec) (not including added content)
Total time gained: 9:39 (9 min 39 sec)

Notes: TV rating bugs are still missing visually, but the correct original
       ratings for all episodes can be accessed by V-chip. Still no return of
       the production code to XDS.

       A new feature this season (broadcast season, that is): in syndication,
       between the main credits and the production logos, a few seconds of
       Spanish voiceover credits are inserted. As far as I know, there has
       been no change to the show's availability in Spanish, but there it is.
       As a result, syndicated versions are now a few seconds shorter to
       accommodate this, and to reduce confusion I am not including the new
       Spanish credits in timings. Usually this section is silent
       (occasionally doing a poor job of separating the theme and Gracie
       sound), but at times it is tweaked within the context of the credits,
       and noted where that occurs. I have noticed these appear in Family Guy
       season 6 in syndication, which started the same time, as well.

       Compression and expansion have been about as usual; I'm making the
       guide easier to read by putting basic compression notes to the right
       of act lines.

       More original commercial breaks. Out of 20 episodes, 15 have them; of
       the 5 that do not, *4* have special music that is replaced. However, I
       think that the original breaks in this phase (not seasons 6-9) have
       had more to do with cuts than preserving the continuity of music. With
       few exceptions, original breaks = no cuts, modified breaks = cuts. On
       the plus side, after this season, only KABF14-21 might be subject to
       this, as KABF22 and up are in a four-act format, and both the opening
       and credits are adjacent to story. I'd like to see the syndicators
       mess that up! (Not really. You know they can find a way.)

       Speaking of openings, this is the first season since 7 and 10 (if I am
       not mistaken) to have the entire season's worth intact in syndication.

       Finally, a big thanks to Tim Reardon, former SCG editor, who also
       checked this season and corroborated my notes. Additional remarks
       based on his notes are found in the text.
