> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
===============================================================================
The cars along the street disappear in some scenes.  {dh}

The man who corrects Homer ("That's a _right_ triangle!") gets it wrong
as well.  (see "Comments" section)

Kent's earphone in the Social Security office changes from white to
brown.

In the painting of Jebediah Springfield in the town hall, he's pointing
with his left hand, but in the statue, he's pointing with his right
hand.  {ddg}

When Lisa stands up at the town hall meeting, at first Apu is sitting
behind her, the scene shifts, and when it comes back someone else (the
twins?) are sitting behind her.  {sr}

Quimby's suitcase disappears from certain scenes (at the meeting).  {dh}

Quimby bangs his fist to get the people's attention, yet he uses a
mallet later on.  (I wonder where he got the mallet?)  {dh}

Just before everyone tosses their hats in the air, the guy in the white
sweater to the left of the aisle turns his head completely around
without moving his shoulders.  {tab}

Jebediah's statue pointing finger switches hands.  {dh}

Homer deals a 9 that has three rows of three symbols and an 8 that has
its symbols in rows of 3, 2, 3 (as opposed to columns of 3, 2, 3 which
is correct).  {ddg}

The dice are always white, opaque, and quite small; casino dice are red,
transparent (or at least translucent - light gets through), and much
bigger than "ordinary" dice, to make it virtually impossible to load
them.  {ddg}

A plate of food replaces Homer's cards.  {dh}

When Maggie lands on the table, one of the dice has a "1" and "6" on
adjacent sides; when Skinner tosses his dice, there is a "3" and a "4"
on adjacent sides.  Dice are always made so the opposite sides add up to
7, not adjacent sides.  {ddg}

It doesn't seem that Marge is properly sitting on that stool.  {dh}

The first time Marge plays a slot machine, the right wheel stops first,
then the center, then the left, instead of left-to-right.  {ddg}

Marge isn't wearing a watch until she needed it.  {dh}

When Bart opens up his casino, he is talking on the phone.  In the
initial shot, he his wearing a tux, with a shirt which buttons down the
front.  However, in a close up, the shirt he's wearing looks like a t-
shirt (i.e., with no front seam.)  {as}

Whem Maggie's pacifier falls into the woman's cup of coins, it gets much
smaller.  {ddg}

When Maggie lands on the crap table, her arm is on "FIELD", and the dice
come up "2" - rather than Maggie being taken in, she should have paid
2-1.  (But what would Marge do with three babies?)  {ddg}

Burns' spray can disappears.  {dh}

How does Maggie get home?  When Homer is about to leave and Marge tells
him to go without her, Maggie isn't there.  {ddg}

When Robert Goulet hits Milhouse with his microphone, it appears as if
Milhouse's glasses go through his head (not actually into his head, but
from the front immediately to the back).  {ddg}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Adam Levin: Great episode on gambling!  I thought Flanders would have
    been against it.  Is Bart rich now, or what?  Burns as Howard
    Hughes.  And Cooney still has a glass chin, even as a cartoon!

Neil Berkman: I thought it was by far the worst Simpsons episode ever.
    Not a laugh in it.  I could pull a better cartoon out of my...Hey
    kids!!  Bill Oakley, if you're reading this, sorry, but that episode
    was the absolute bottom of the barrel.  Just when I was regaining
    some faith in the show after the dismal start of the season...

Ron Carter: Grade: B. I thought this one was pretty solid; a good build-
    up with some solid refs; the triple gag of the "Hurrays" during the
    gambling "vote" was great.  Burns transition to Howard Hughes was as
    bizarre (and funny this time around) as the real thing.

Carl Frank: Not one of my favorites.  [...] As references go, Kissinger,
    Goulet, Hughes, Cooney, the corrupt Senator, were all good (the
    laugh track when Homer tripped over the footstool was excellent).
    But overall, I would have to say that a fully complete plot was
    lacking.  Rating: C/C+.

Don Del Grande: This episode didn't seem to go anywhere, probably
    because it focused a little too much on Marge at the slot machine,
    where all she did was put the quarter in the slot and pull the
    handle.  [...] It did have its moments, [...] but it didn't
    particularly stand out, especially with another "Homer and Marge
    together" ending.

Elson Trinidad: Well, as a story and plot, it was rather fair.  But it
    had IMHO the best gags of any Simpsons episode of recent memory.
    Barney stole the show.

Neil Berkman: Like several other episodes this season, this was kind of
    a "pod people" Simpsons - it had the form of a Simpsons episode, but
    there was just something terribly wrong with it.  Some of the jokes
    might have been clever had I not seen them so many times before in
    other episodes.

Scott Mankey: I thought this was a great episode, I'll give it an A-.  I
    liked the opening with the young Abe and Jasper.  One bit I thought
    went on a little too long (ala the "Rake" scene) was Burns laughing
    after remembering running into the Irish guy with the bumper car.

Stephan Gharibian: I'm confused about the whole show.  It didn't get
    anywhere, and despite the huge potential of the idea of gambling
    coming to Springfield, the plot was weakly developed.

Harv Laser: I found this episode, except for the weak ending, hilarious,
    with the references coming so fast and furious I could hardly keep
    up with them.  I'd give it an A-.

Jeremy Greystoke: Overall, I thought this one was good.  Not as good as
    Last Temptation or Marge On The Lam (the interpolation of the
    Dragnet theme with the Simpsons theme was incredible) but a worthy
    effort: B/B+.

Andrew Bolgus: "$pringfield" was a howl, a real winner.  Burns turning
    into Howard Hughes was a scream, especially when he pulls the gun on
    Smithers.  Plus it had Robert Goulet as a guest star, so now The
    Simpsons has something in common with that other great comedy,
    Alice.

Joey Berner: I really laughed a lot at "$pringfield, or..." The pacing
    was about the best it's been this season, quick punchlines and
    cutting between scenes, really did make this one in my top three of
    the season.  [...] I give this one a B+.

Yours truly: Didn't work for me.  Kissinger, Cooney, and Goulet were
    excellent, but I didn't get the Howard Hughes thing, so I was going
    "Huh?..." Homer was being stupid again: ridiculous blackjack dealer,
    "Rain Man" joke, and mocking Marge at the end weren't funny for me.
    I give it a D+.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> "Amos and Andy"

Ron Carter explains, "For those not familiar with early US radio
    history: Amos and Andy was a very popular comedy radio show
    (1929-54) which starred two white men (Freeman Gosden, Charles
    Correll) who affected black `dialects' etc."

>> Springfield Aqua-Car

Al Wesolowsky says, "These vehicles really existed.  The ones shown in
    the newsreel were pretty much like the ones I recall from the late
    50s/early 60s.  They could be driven on land and would operate like
    a boat in the water.  Lyndon B. Johnson had one on his ranch near
    Johnson City, Texas, and it was on display there as late as 1983."

>> James L. Brooks jokes

Aditya Sood says of the two porno movie titles "Sperms of Endearment"
    and "I'll Do Anyone", they are "both obviously parodies of the James
    L. Brooks' films `Terms of Endearment' and `I'll Do Anything.'
    (which is still unreleased.).  James L. Brooks, of course, is the
    producer of the Simpsons."

Juha Terho notices, "$pringfield, Marge in Chains and Marge Gets A Job
    were all written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein.  Two of those
    episodes parodied Terms of Endearment and all three had a secondary
    plot in the first act that had a little or nothing to do with the
    main story.  And hey, compare `Spruce Moose' with Marge Gets A Job's
    `Spruce Caboose'!
    So, I predict the next Oakley/Weinstein episode, Lisa vs. Malibu
    Stacy will parody Terms of Endearment and Spruce Goose in some way,
    and at least have a first act that doesn't connect well to the
    primary plot."

>> Pythagorean error

After putting on Dr. Kissinger's glasses, Homer says "The sum of the
    square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to
    the square root of the remaining side," to which the man in the
    bathroom stall goes, "That's a right triangle, you idiot!"

Marc Dreyfuss comments, "Not only is what Homer said not true for
    isosceles triangles, but also, it is in fact the SQUARES of two
    sides and the SQUARE of the remaining side.  And not just ANY side,
    but the sides that subtend the 90 degree angle.  I'm afraid the
    Simpson's might have really shown us the depth of math-illiteracy in
    this country -- even the person in the stall who screamed `idiot!'
    couldn't get the problem right."

Ron Carter says this is a reference to "The Wizard of Oz", in the scene
    where the Scarecrow is given a brain and says the same thing.  He
    says, "And the guy in the booth is right; it -is-a right angle -and-
    they -did-get it wrong in the movie; I never noticed."

>> "The Gong Show"

Ron Carter explains, "For those not familiar with US TV shows of the
    70s, `The Gong Show' was mostly a real life farce, in that it looked
    for the worst acts to perform, and then (usually) washed up
    celebrities would judge them.  They had a large `gong' on stage,
    which the judges would hit to disqualify an act.  The `Two Guys' act
    was a real act on the show, as was the robot that caught fire."

>> The drinking scene

Andrew Mutchler gives a complete list of the details of the scene of
    debauchery right after Homer says, "We've really done something for
    the children."  In the town square, roughly left to right:

    - A man warms his hands by a fire built in a garbage can
    - A really drunk man drinks from a bottle, dances and falls over
    - A man and a hooker dance on the rooftop of a place called "Tony's"
    - A man kisses a hooker
    - A man in a sailor suit kisses a hooker
    - A man sits on the shoulders of the Jebediah Springfield statue and
      drinks from a bottle
    - A man leans against the statue and drinks from a bottle
    - A man kisses a hooker
    - A man and a hooker dance on the roof of what looks like a
      courthouse
    - A man lights firecrackers
    - A man pushes another man drinking from a bottle in a shopping cart
    - Somebody is doing something beside one of the lions on the
      courthouse steps, but I couldn't make it out
    - A man kisses a hooker on the courthouse steps
    - Three people kneel on the ground, apparently shooting craps.

>> Tiger in-joke?

Jeremy Greystoke suspects, "Remember that David Mirkin is now the
    producer of The Simpsons.  He used to be involved with Chris
    Elliott's wonderfully demented Get A Life.  One of the classic
    episodes of that short-lived series revolved around a community
    theater production of that beloved Broadway musical classic: `Zoo
    Animals On Wheels'.  Yes, I think we can safely establish the
    existence of a trend.  :)"

>> Bart's martini experience

Timothy Callahan writes, "Bart comments on the quality of the casino's
    martinis.  I guess he'd know a good martini when he saw one, what
    with all the mixology he learned in Bart the Murderer.  [8F03]"

>> Possible references

Linden Mason asks, "Well, this is a reach: Did anyone else think that
    the whole `Boogey-man' scene looked suspiciously like `Night of the
    Living Dead'?"

And Andrew Krieg says, "Here's a stretch for a movie reference.  Krusty
    sings the Name Game `Herpes, Herpes, bo Berpes...' and Burns turns
    into Howard Hughes.  The movie `Melvin and Howard' features Howard
    Hughes getting picked up while hitch-hiking and forced to sing the
    Name Game in order to get a ride."

  Kent: Scott, things aren't as happy as they used to be down here at
        the unemployment office.  Joblessness is no longer just for

% Marge greets Homer at the blackjack table.

Marge: Hi Homey.
Homer: Hey Marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, I
       bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino.
Marge: I was for the casino.
Homer: Strike three, Marge!  I remember that meeting and I have a
       photographic memory.
        [In Homer's memory, Marge wears a blue dress and has green hair.
       She holds a rolling pin.  Homer's arms are massive]
Marge: Legalized gambling is a bad idea.  You can build a casino over my

       blah blah blah.
  Man: For you: it's the President.  [tentacle hands Homer a phone]

-- No captive audience, "$pringfield"

% As Marge walks away from Homer, she notices a shiny 1992 quarter on
% the red carpet.  "I wonder if they have a Lost and Found?" she asks,
% but she notices the "25 cent" sign above a nearby slot machine.  "Oh,
% what the hey," she reasons, and puts the coin in.
%
% The wheels stop spinning, and a short snatch of victory music sounds.
% Four quarters drop into the tray, and Marge seems impressed.  She
% walks out the sliding doors of the casino, but looking at her watch,
% she decides she has time for a couple more turns on the slot machine.
%
% Bart's casino is doing well.  A lighted sign announces, "Tonight:
% Milhouse.  Next week: an evening with Jimbo."  Inside, under the odds
% board, children swarm around the buffet.  Jimbo uses a rake as a
% croupier stick at the craps table.

Hey, how's it going?  Hey: good to see you.  Hey, friends: looking
lucky.  Hey, what's happenin'?  Love the jacket.
-- Bart the Emcee at his own casino, "$pringfield"

% Milhouse's act involves Snowball II and "The Box of Mystery."  He
% says, "The cat goes in --" but the poor animal seems reluctant to
% comply.  Milhouse tries to force her, but this only aggravates her
% more.  She knocks his top hat off to reveal another similar-looking

Homer: Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem.
Marge: You know, you're right, Homer.  Maybe I should get some
       professional help.
Homer: No, no, that's too expensive.  Just don't do it any more.
-- "$pringfield"

% Robert Goulet performs at Bart's Casino.

[singing]
Jingle Bells, Batman Smells
Robin laid an egg
Batmobile lost its wheel
The Joker got away, hey!
 [spoken] Thank you, thank you very much.
 [hits Milhouse in the face with the microphone]
Oh, I'm sorry, kid...
-- Robert Goulet performs for Bart and his friends, "$pringfield"

% Principal Skinner hands out awards at the geography pageant

Skinner: And special awards go to the two students who obviously had no
         help from their parents: Lisa Simpson and Ralph Wiggum.
  Ralph: I'm Idaho!
Skinner: Yes, of course you are.
-- Ralph and his "Idaho" sign, "$pringfield"

% Marge and Homer walk out of the casino and then along the waterfront.

Homer: You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage I can finally
       look down my nose at you.  _You_ have a gambling problem!
Marge: That's true.  Will you forgive me?
Homer: Oh, sure.  Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches
       from Sears?
Marge: Hmm.
Homer: Well, that's nothing, because _you_ have a gambling problem!  And
       remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he
       was dressed like Santa Claus?
Marge: Hmm.
Homer: Well _you_ have a gambling problem!
Marge: Homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them
       like that.
Homer: Aw, what a gyp.
        [They kiss]
Homer: Remember when I --
Marge: Homer!
Homer: Oh, yeah; I forgot already.
-- Forgive, and...forget, "$pringfield"

% The music over the closing credits is akin to a Las Vegas show tune.
% Over the "Gracie Films" logo, we hear a slot machine handle being
