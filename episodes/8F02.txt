They're baaaaaaack!

For reference, the three dreams will be called `The Monkey's Paw', `The
Bart Zone', and `If I Only Had a Brain'.  (Thanks to Ron Carter {rc} for
suggesting the first two titles.)

And a spelling note:  I belong to the old school of English orthography,
so I spell Hallowe'en with an apostrophe.  I have tried to resist the
temptation to enforce this spelling rule on other people's text.

> Didja notice...
===============================================================================
    ... Homer was wearing a fez which still had the price tag attached?
    ... Marge exclaimed, ``Oh, my land!'' instead of ``Oh, my Lord'',
        in keeping with her opening disclaimer?
    ... there was money coming out of Marge's hair?
    ... the aliens were basically the same aliens from last year's
        Hallowe'en episode?
    ... the alien Kodos was wearing a ``King of the earth'' sash?
    ... in Moe's tavern, Barney and the guys are drunkenly mumbling,
        ``Happy thoughts... Happy thoughts...''?
    ... Bart (in his nightmare) was wearing Krusty pajamas?
    ... how the images of Burns and Smithers changed as they walked
        behind various pieces of glassware in the lab?

===============================================================================
> Rave reviews
===============================================================================
I loved the self-referential complaints about Simpsons merchandising.

The Hallowe'en episodes are the best because they can do totally bizarre
things.  Not only can they ignore continuity, but they are no longer
constrained by the laws of physics.

Ron Carter {rc}:  Great episode!  Favorite quote:
    Dammit, Smithers, this isn't rocket science, it's brain surgery!

David Hyatt (dhyatt@leland.Stanford.EDU): I personally thought this was by
far the best episode of the season -- the wildest, most creative, and with
best handling of characters.

David Moery's favorite line:  Look at me!  I'm Davey Crockett!

John De Carlo's {jdc} favorites:  Bad corpse!  Stop scaring Smithers!

A Warren Pratten {awp}:  Oh good!  The curtains are on fire!
    ``I just started laughing uncontrollably.  I actually
      had to pause the VCR for about 5 minutes to recover.''

Shane P. Faulkner {spf}:  The quick shot of Burns and Smithers chowing down
on a pizza right after performing the brain surgery.  Sheer comic Genius!!!

  + The Monkey's Paw
        - the play is about a monkey's paw which grants wishes, though
          the wishes always carry with them undesireable side-effects.
    The New Twilight Zone (TV)
        - the episode where some boys have several wishes which backfire.
          One is a wish for X-ray specs which ends up working too well,
          enabling them to see all the way to the bones. {msb}
    A Small Talent For War (Twilight Zone)
        - aliens threaten earth with destruction.  In haste, the humans
          arrange universal peace.  This humors the aliens, who created earth
          in order to breed warriors.  Earth, with its `small talent for war',
          is thus doomed to destruction as a failure.  This has <some>

  + It's a GOOD Life (Twilight Zone, from a short story by Jerome Bixby)
        - young boy (Billy Mumy from Lost in Space) alters things with his

          an offending man into a jack-in-the-box. {wb}
        - people constantly saying, ``It's very good that you did that.'' {rb2}
        - the music during Bart's dream was very TZish.
        - the story was remade in ``The Twilight Zone:  The Movie'' with
          Kathleen Quinlan and ... Nancy Cartwright! {rb}  No doubt this
          influenced the writers' decision to re-remake the story.

  + One Froggy Evening (Chuck Jones cartoon)
        - in the cartoon, a frog dances and sings ``Hello, My Baby''.

        - Principal Skinner sings the same song over the P.A.
          You can also hear his feet thumping.
  + Duck Amuck
        - Snowball II looks a lot like Daffy Duck in the cartoon.  That's the

          Daffy even breathes flames just like the cat. {elm}

{discovered by eas, my co-worker}

There's (carefully) no evidence of the lack of Burns's head being sewn on
to Homer after he wakes up, until he sees it in the mirror.  This requires
Homer to be oddly to the side of the TV screen in a way which is quite
well done; after I saw it the first time, I was sure that we had seen that
Burns's head wasn't on Homer when he was in bed.

Homer's stitches are gone when he goes to the bathroom, though Burns still
has his. {msb}

   Maggie is moved from one side of the table to the other.

===============================================================================
> Assorted observations and comments
===============================================================================
>> Marge, the Bride of Frankenstein

The 17 October 1990 TV Guide listed Marge Simpson as one of the ten
worst-dressed TV personalities.  They said that Marge bore a resemblance
to the Bride of Frankenstein.  No doubt the writers bore this in mind
when writing the 1991 Hallowe'en episode.

>> Johnny Carson's Karnak sketch

You can catch a glimpse of Johnny with his giant turban on the TV set
when Marge comes in.

First, note that in Homer's dream the kids are up late watching The Tonight
Show.  We've already seen [8F05] that Lisa has trouble staying up until
midnight.  This could mean that Homer doesn't know much about his kids
(since it was his dream), or the Simpsons live in the Central/Mountain
time zone, where Carson is on at 10:30 instead of 11:30, or perhaps it was
one of Johnny's prime-time anniversary shows.

As for what the question in the envelope was, here are some ideas...

    Give three examples of bad news/gnus.           {rjc}
    Name three AMA-approved substitutes for ipecac. {bdm}

Mike Berman {msb} notes that whenever Johnny makes a list, the question
has to rhyme, so he proposes
    Name a spic, a chick, and something sick.       {msb}
Apologies if this offended anyone, but it <does> have to rhyme.

Yes, I know that the writers probably didn't have any question in mind,
but it's fun to play along.

>> Homer's nap

John De Carlo {jdc} notes:

Some nap.  The sun is high in the sky when he goes to sleep (around noon?)
and the moon is high in the sky when they come by (I don't know what time,
but classically they wait until midnight to grave rob).  I guess he was
missing his sleep in the nuclear plant.

Ahem.  Hello, everyone.  Before last year's Hallowe'en show, I warned you
not to let your children watch.  But you did anyway.  Mm.  Well, this
year's episode is even worse.  It's scarier, more violent, and I think
they snuck in some bad language, too.  So please, tuck in your children
and... [sighs]  Well, if you didn't listen to me last time, you're not
going to now.  Enjoy the show.

Homer:    [still dozing at his post]
Smithers: Wake up, Homer.
Homer:    [startles awake]
Smithers: You're fired.
Homer:    For what?
Smithers: For sleeping on the job.
Homer:    How'd you know I was sleeping?
Smithers: We've been watching you on the surveillance camera.
Homer:    Camera?  [spots the camera]  D'oh!
-- `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% Burns and Smithers pull an oil lamp, and they vanish behind the
% fireplace in Burns' office into a dugeon laboratory.  Burns has
% come to the conclusion that the problem with the common worker is
% that the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.  His solution:
% to replace the flesh with steel.

Behold!  The greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat o' nine
tails!  [unveils his Frankenstein monster]
-- `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% Smithers asks how long before it's ready (``Keep your pants on, Smithers''),
% and Burns says they first need a human brain.

Lisa:  [reading the classifieds]  Hey, here's a good job, Dad!
       Oh, wait, you have to know how to operate an ultrasonic
       lithotriptor.
Homer: How hard can it be?
Bart:  Hey Dad, here's one!  $28/hr, plenty of fresh air, and you
       get to meet lots of interesting people.
Homer: Ooh, what job is that?
Bart:  Grave digger. [laughs evilly]
-- `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% Homer is digging a grave, being supervised by Groundskeeper Willie.
% When Willie leaves, Homer takes a nap in the grave.  That evening,
% Smithers and Burns pay a visit to the cemetery in search of a brain.
% They find an open grave (Homer) and cart him away.

Smithers, get him out quickly.  The stench is overpowering.
-- Burns finds Homer's ``dead'' body,
   `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

Smithers: That's Homer Simpson.  He wasn't exactly a model employee.
Burns:    Well, who <is> a model [sees Smithers sans skull, just brain]
          employee....
Smithers: [panicking]  Uh, Simpson will do just fine, sir.
-- `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% As they drag Homer away in a bag, he wakes up and struggles.

Smithers: You hear that, sir?
Burns:    No, I didn't.  Who is it?  Frankenstein?  The Booooger Man?
-- Me and my shadow, `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

Smithers: It's the man in the bag, sir.  I think he's alive.
Burns:    Oh.  [walks over to it, and thwacks it with a shovel]
          Bad corpse.  [thwack]  Bad corpse. [thwack]
          Stop [thwack] scaring [thwack] Smithers! [thwack]
-- `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% In the lab...

Burns:    [saws off the top of Homer's head.  No blood, very clean.
           The top of Homer's head rolls away.]
          Smithers, hand me that ice-cream scoop.
Smithers: Ice-cream scoop?!
Burns:    Dammit, Smithers, this isn't rocket science, it's brain surgery!
-- `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% He plucks out Homer's brain and puts it atop his own head.  (``Look at me!
% I'm Davey Crockett!'')  They install the brain in the robot, then eat
% some pepperoni pizza, then power it up (with your standard horror movie
% Big Switch, accompanied by lightning and sparks).

It's alive!  Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad.  Well, who's
mad now!  [laughs diabolically]
-- Mad Scientist Burns, `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% ``Hi there.  I'm your daddy.''  The robot looks around and spots a box of
% donuts with its X-Ray vision.  (Accompanied by the now-familiar servo
% sounds.)  It crashes through walls to get to it.  (``Mm.. Sprinkles.'')

Johnny Carson:  [as Karnak] Geraldo Rivera, Madonna, and a diseased yak.
Ed McMahon:     Ho ho ho ho.
-- Watching TV, `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

Lisa:  Mom, what's wrong?
Marge: It's your father.  He's missing.
Bart:  Dad's missing?  Get outta here.
Marge: He's been gone for two days.
Lisa:  Whaddya know.  She's right.
-- Familial concern, `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% Burns, in tears, cries, ``It wasn't supposed to be this way...''
% as he sees the robot asleep at the console, just like Homer was.

I was wrong to play God.  Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with.
Now take out that brain and flush it down the toilet.
-- Mad Doctor Burns, `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% But Smithers prevails on Burns to return the brain.  Burns sews Homer's
% head shut, as Homer mutters, ``Ow.  Ow.''

Smithers: You know what this means?  He <is> alive!
Burns:    Oh, you're right, Smithers.  I guess I owe you a Coke.
-- `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

And as for you, you clinking, clattering cacophany of colligenous
cog and camshifts, take that! [feebly kicks it]
-- Mad Doctor Burns, `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% The robot falls on Burns, trapping him.

Every bone ... shattered, organs ... leaking vital fluids ...
a slight headache ... loss of appetite.  Smithers, I'm going to die.
-- Mad Doctor Burns, `If I Only Had a Brain' in ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% He asks Smithers to go up to his office and fetch surgical tools,
% and some ether...

Homer: [wakes up and screams]
Marge: Did you have a nightmare, Homey?
Homer: No, Bart bit me.
Bart:  Hey, man, you were crushing me.  I tried to scream, but my mouth
       was full of flab.
-- ``Treehouse of Horror II''

% Homer goes to the bathroom and looks in the mirror, when what does he
% see but Burns' head sewn onto his right shoulder.

Burns: Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads.  Well, my body was
       crushed, so I had my head grafted onto your, shall we say, ample frame.
Homer: [trying to stay calm]  I can wake up.  It's all a dream.
       It's just a dream.
Burns: Oh, that's right.  It's all a dream... Or is it? [laughs diabolically]
       [Executive Producer credit appears]
Announcer:  Next week, on `The Simpsons'...
       [the breakfast table]
Lisa:  [puts down the newspaper]  Don't forget, Dad, tonight my class is having
       an all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinner.
Homer: Mmm...  Spaghetti.
Burns: [his head attached to Homer's shoulder]  But Homer, tonight's our
       reception for Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands!
Homer: Oh, I hate having two heads.
