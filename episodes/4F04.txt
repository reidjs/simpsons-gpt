> "TV Guide" Synopsis  {jmb}
==============================================================================
   At the Simpsons' party, Milhouse's parents decide to divorce,
   prompting Homer to take action to prevent a similar fate for himself
   and Marge.

==============================================================================
> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Couch      :- OFF run to the couch and sit, but Bart is glowing green.
              Homer fiddles with the TV, switching him to red. Then he
              slaps him behing the head, giving him back his normal
              yellow color.

==============================================================================
> Did you notice...
==============================================================================
   ... the Allied Biscuit box has the Nabisco logo in the upper
       left-hand corner?
   ... Homer is reading "Hot Lotto Picks Weekly" in bed?
   ... Kearney's kid sounds just like Ralph Wiggum?
   ... the woman at the Marriage Bureau sounds like Lunchlady Doris (the
       late Doris Grau)?
         [does this mean Lunch Lady Doris will speak again?  -- {ddg}]
   ... we never see what "dignity" looks like?
   ... Milhouse apparently leaves with Mrs. Hibbert's fur coat (she
       doesn't have it on when she leaves)?
   ... the "El Barto" graffiti outside the Springfield Marriage Bureau
       building?
   ... Lisa drinks caffeine-laden Buzz cola just before going to bed?
       She won't sleep for hours, unless her system is already
       saturated...
         [Maybe it was caffeine-free Buzz (which sounds just ridiculous
         enough to actually exist in Springfield). -- {dga}]

Dale G. Abersold:
   ... this is the first episode named after Milhouse (if you don't
       count "Bart's Friend Falls in Love" [8F22])?
   ... this is the first full episode written by Steve Tompkins?
   ... this was the eighth consecutive episode without the normal
       closing title music?

Benjamin Ball:
   ... the shrub outside of the "Perm bank" looks like Marge's hair?
   ... Homer's shirt is blue in one scene?
   ... the Lunchlady Doris-esque woman is smoking in a government
       building?  (Lest we forget the consequenses from episode 2F14?)

Chris Courtois:
   ... The Hibberts, the Flanderseses, and the Van Houtens all brought
       their children. No Jessica Lovejoy however. Must be in another
       boarding school.

James R. Curry:
   ... before the dinner party starts, every light is on in OFF's house?
   ... when Homer visits Mr Van Houten, the clock on the wall reads 9
       O'clock, since it's daylight outside it must be 9am, and they're
       both drinking beer at this time?
   ... Homer manages to wake up before 6AM?
   ... Homer actually gets Patty and Selma to come to the second
       wedding?

Jason H. Elliott:
   ... Mr. Van Houten is smoking at the Simpsons dinner party?

Joshua Fruhlinger:
   ... Bart does Dr. Hibbert's trademark chuckle while imitating him?
   ... Dr. Hibbert apparently brings his doctor's jacket to social
       occasions?
   ... Luanne is referred to as "Mrs. Van Houten" even after the
       divorce?  (Perhaps they're just separated.)
   ... Luanne starts dressing a lot sexier after the divorce?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Lisa has meatballs (or maybe "meatball substitute") on her dish?
   ... Maggie can get out of her high chair without lifting the tray?
   ... while everybody else is eating, Snowball II is licking herself
       and Maggie's tray is empty?
   ... the Simpsons have four toilets (or at least four seats)?
   ... Homer is taking a bath (as opposed to a shower, which he usually
       takes)?
   ... Kirk's song includes the words "glove of love", a slang term for
       a condom?
   ... Maggie falls for only the fourth episode (and falls more than
       once for just the second time) in the last two seasons?
   ... when Maggie is in the non-stick pan, she "rides" it like she's on
       a skateboard working a half-pipe?
   ... Maggie is in a stroller (for the third time ever)?
   ... The circle-C is back in the copyright message, but the C is
       different from how it used to look?
   ... Nelson's mother used a combination cough medicine and breath
       freshener?
   ... Marge seats everybody "boy-girl-boy-girl"?

Andrew Krupowicz:
   ... the Hibbert's teen son doesn't come to dinner (typical)?
   ... during dinner, Maggie isn't in either of the two rooms?
   ... the car alarm going off during the ext. shot of Casa Nova?

Ricardo Lafaurie:
   ... the sexual humor in 'thawing hot dogs in the sink'?
   ... a divorce costs $8?

Haynes Lee:
   ... Milhouse in fur coat sounds like Martin Prince?
   ... Homer mistaking the punch bowl for Liz Taylor's wedding ring?

Jeff Mezger:
   ... Patty and Selma are wearing black to Marge's second wedding?

David Ney:
   ... Kirk works at "Southern Cracker"?
   ... the cracker sculpture in Kirk's boss' office?
   ... Patty & Selma flirting with Chase?

Damian Penny:
   ... Milhouse's little car looks like an S-class Mercedes?
   ... the Van Houtens had two cars?  (The Bonneville and the red
       convertible)

Dallas Pesola:
   ... in the Perm Bank when Homer is standing in front of a picture of
       a redhead while Marge scolds him, it looks like he has red hair?

Mark Aaron Richey:
   ... the star magnet on the dishwasher?
   ... even Rod and Todd laugh at Bart's "amputated butt" joke?
   ... Kirk's blue slippers by his bed?
   ... Bart is carrying Marge's purse when they come home from the
       dentist?
   ... this was yet another episode without the regular closing theme?

Benjamin J. Robinson:
   ... Homer apparently eats eight hot dogs in one sitting?
   ... in the house, Milhouse drives a mini-Mercedes SL?
   ... Marge says she and Homer will never end up like the Van Houtens
       right in front of the Van Houtens?  (Sure, Homer does much the
       same thing, but you expect that from him.)

Ana Robles:
   ... Lisa continued to sing after Luanne announced she wanted a
       divorce?

Liam J. Scanlam:
   ... the Flanders' let Rod and Todd play with Bart and Milhouse? (and
       they're talking about amputating Milhouse's butt.)
   ... this episode is based on Milhouse's point of view on the divorce,
       yet he has only a few lines?

=  Homer's fork goes missing while he licks his plate, but reappears for
   him to pick up the meatball.  {jrc}

*  How could Homer be licking his plate and talking at the same time?
   {dn}

=  The size of the stain that Marge's meatball made keeps changing.
   {mar}

=  Homer's plate magically refills and empties again during the scene
   after he's finished eating.

=  Homer has a glass of milk or water, then has only a Duff beer, then
   has both.  {dp2}

=  Bart is shown eating with his left hand in a close up, then eats with
   his right hand in a wider shot.  {dp2}

=  Lisa does not have a beverage glass on her TV tray, then has one a
   minute later.  {dp2}

-  In the scene where Maggie is sliding around in the pot, there are
   frames where you can see through Maggie.  {ddg}

-  When Marge is getting the toilet seat out of the dishwasher, the
   kitchen window curtains don't have their corn ears.  {ddg}

*  Despite the fact that steam is coming out of the dishwasher, Marge
   and Lisa are able to hold them without burning themselves.  {ddg}

=  When Marge opens the dishwasher, the toilet seats are put in two by
   two. When she opens the oven, the three remaining seats are now lined
   up in one long row.

-  When Marge puts the candle back, she "snaps her wrist" so the candle
   will go back the right way, but she does it in 1/30 (or 1/25 in PAL
   countries) of a second.  {ddg}

-  After Marge chews down the candle and puts it on the table, the
   candle jumps to its previous size for a frame or two.  {ak}

   on the couch.  After he draws the picture, Marge is back in her
   original position.  {bjr}

*  Only the top of the box with Kirk's clothes in it burned, despite it
   being a cardboard box.  {ddg}

=  Kearney was originally sitting next to the window; his son appears
   out of nowhere after moving over.  {jh}

+  In 2F07, Kirk mentions "pushing the twin beds together"; why would he
   boast of having a separate bed?  {jh}

*  "Radio 530" is almost always reserved for a city's traffic control
   announcements (so is 1610); it's not on a lot of older radios.  {ddg}
      [which makes Kirk even stupider to believe Starla's story --ed]

=  The amount and placing on the frost on the hot dogs changes with each
   successive close-up.  {mar}

+  Plato's casino, seen in the flashback, wasn't there in 8F10.  {jh}

*  How could Homer file a divorce without Marge being there to sign the
   papers?  {dn}

+  Marge promised butterscotch chicken for dinner, but in 7F22 she said
   Bart was allergic to butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.

-  At the beginning of the "surprise party", the picture of Maggie is
   missing her bow.  {ddg}

c  Grampa's "Surprise!" was not captioned.  {jh}

c  The captions have song lyrics, "Don't go changing to try to please
   me," but only instrumental music is heard.  {jh}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Poor Milhouse: he finally gets an episode named after
   him, but he hardly appears in it.  Shouldn't The Simpsons show
   divorce from the children's point of view (like [7G11])?  Why give so
   much screen time to characters (the adult Van Houtens) we don't even
   care about?  There were a few good gags, enough to save it from a
   failing grade.  (C-)

Jennifer M. Blaske:  This was definitely not one of the best episodes.
   Was there a new writer or something? Most of the jokes felt really
   forced to me, although I did LOL when Bart broke the chair over
   Homer's back. The scene with fighting over the meatball went on too
   long, and I didn't care for Lisa walking into the room singing. The
   jump from Milhouses's parents to Homer's worries was too abrupt. And
   this is incidental, but I would have preferred if Milhouses's parents
   had decided not to split up at the end.  (C-)

Ron Bodner:  Nice to have a few jokes that I could actually laugh out
   loud at. The jokes were fresh, rather than predictable jokes based on
   the previous jokes of writers with talent (see: "Bart After Dark").
   Would be a ten if it weren't for Homer's cartoonish stupidity and his
   _extremely_ forced talk with a carless Kirk Van Houten ("It can't
   just be the sex! It can't!).  (B+)

Chris Courtois:  "A Milhouse Divided" was full of good gags and one of
   the better Homer stories of the past few seasons. Homer got to be
   Homer, not Homer the asshole or Homer the moron or Homer the wacky.
   While "the Simpson marriage is in trouble because Homer is a clod"
   story has been done before, this one had some original stuff and
   wasn't just a retread of "Jacques to be Wild", "War of the Simpsons",
   and "Secrets of a Successful Marriage". I liked the fact that Marge
   wasn't pissed at Homer for anything, and he reformed on his own. It
   wasn't sidesplitting ROFL funny, but this one did elicit laughs
   frequently and regularly. I think I'll resurrect my early Season 7
   cliche and dub this one a "solid, but unspectacular"  (B+)

James R Curry:  Not a bad episode, better than Burns, baby, Burns but
   not as good as The Homer they Fall.  Some good jokes and gags, and
   the dinner party scene was really good.  Homer is more like the 'Well
   meaning but failing' Homer who appeared in some first season
   episodes.  (C)

Steve Frayne:  Excellent interjections of comic relief added some snappy
   humor to an average story line.  The idea of Homer realizing his
   marriage isn't beyond reproach was a great one, but too much time was
   spent early on the Van Houtens forcing a hurried ending.  (B-)

Joshua Fruhlinger:  A good, sweet, funny, but not great episode.  I
   really did like the ending, especially the fact the Kirk and Luanne
   did _not_ get back together... too many TV shows just have everyone
   get along again at the end.  The way they did it here was much more
   realistic and kept that Simpsons bite.  I agree the best act was the
   party scene -- very will scripted and directed.  (B+)

Philip Gibbons:  This wasn't an excellent episode, but just one of those
   "okay" episodes that are made usually once or twice a season. I
   thought that the segment featuring Kirk's car being stolen and Homer
   finding quite a bit of humor out of his "Can I Borrow a Feeling"
   cassete was funny. However, I gave a major thumbs down to Bart
   bashing Homer on the head with a chair; I don't see how you can call
   that funny.  (C-)

Jason Hancock:  I won't waste any time saying that I did not like this
   episode.  It was not funny, except for a few gags here and there.
   Also, this "marriage on the rocks" theme -- which I've never liked in
   the first place, even in earlier seasons -- has been done too many
   times before.  (D)

Ryan Johnson:  A fairly solid episode.  The first one this season (sad
   but true), that seemed to be down to earth and belivable.  Not that
   many good gags, but the meatball and hotdog (what's with the meat
   here?) scenes were great.  (B-)

Andrew Krupowicz:  This is a great ep. It had a rich mix of jokes and
   satire. The plot was realistic, with the ironic twists that I love to
   see. Homer's antics were well balanced with the rest of OFF and the
   fact that Kirk didn't get Luanne back was a great way to end this
   episode. Aside from the fact that their marital strife came out of
   nowhere (for the Van Houten's), there's nothing to whine about.  (A)

Ricardo Lafaurie:  Very good episode, I thought.  What made it great was
   that (1) We didn't have the ol' "Milhouse's-parents-get-back-
   together-at-the-end" bit, like I expected, (2) The corny parts were
   leveled with biting humor, and (3) It didn't stray completely from
   OFF, like "A Fish Called Selma".  (A)

David Ney:  A decent episode.  It was nice to see Marge and Homer
   renewing their love, since lately they have been having quite a shaky
   marriage.  Anyway, the part where Bart hit Homer over the head with a
   chair had me ROTFL.  Also Bart's joke about amputating Milhouse's
   butt was cool.  The one thing I can see that was odd about this
   episode is:  for being called "A Milhouse Divided", it sure didn't
   have much to do with Milhouse.  (B)

Damian Penny:  Am I the only one who liked this episode?  I enjoyed
   seeing the Simpsons' universe expanded with an episode focussing on
   characters we've hardly seen - Milhouse's parents - and also seeing a
   bit more of Homer and Marge's wedding.  Plus there were plenty of
   laugh-out-loud moments, such as Homer's wedding vows and Bart
   breaking the chair over Homer's head.  (B+)

Jeff Reis:  I've come to expect mediocrity and this one delivered in
   spades. I laughed when Homer was playing with slot cars in his
   underwear. I think my lips may have curled upward a couple of other
   times. Sure, it's interesting to try to flesh out some of the
   secondary characters, but one important ingredient was forgotten--
   JOKES! So far the *only* episode that has even come close to the
   former high comedic standards of the show has been "The Homer They
   Fall".  (C-)

Mark Aaron Richey:  Some of the best gags and jokes of the season were
   put on a rather weak storyline.  I think we've all seen "Homer and
   Marge's marriage is in crisis" one too many times now, even though I
   do admire the producers for having one of the couples on the show
   split up (even though I'll be surprised if the writers don't "forget"
   they're separated).  I was geneually surprised about the surprise
   wedding, and am glad that Kirk and Luanne did not get back together
   at the end of the episode (wonder if Kirk's singing had anything to
   do with it).  Even though I don't like the plot, the episode was
   still very funny.  (B+)

Matt Rose:  Yes! Much better than last week. I was laughing again. The
   whole "Stoner's Pot Paradise" thing with Otto got me on the floor.
   And despite the ending being a bit mushy, I don't think that ruined
   it for me. And kudos to the writers for finally remembering Maggie
   actually exists as a character and not just decoration. Once again,
   they restore my faith the week after a lousy episode airs.  (B+)

Aaron Varhola:  Uneven; Tompkins's gags were outstanding, but the plot
   seemed contrived, particularly the "marital problems" between Marge
   and Homer (this topic has been addressed three times before, in 7G01,
   7F20, and 1F20, more successfully.  The fight at the party between
   the Van Houtens was too long, and there were pacing problems in the
   first act.  (C+)

Yours Truly:  I will refrain myself from using hip expressions such as
   "second-season quality" or "return to roots", but this definitely
   felt different from recent episodes, being much more down-to-earth
   and character-centered. Although we've been treated with Homer's
   marital problems more than anyone could ever stand, it was nice to
   see Homer as a *caring* person, not the goofbag he's so often
   protrayed as. There were many imperfections throughout the episode,
   but I think that the staff managed to keep it from falling into
   either stand-up comedy or drama, which was not an easy task.  (B)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> That's L-I-N-C-O-N for you

Mark Aaron Richey:  "A house divided against itself cannot stand", the
   most famous phrase from Abraham Lincoln's speech in 1858 about the
   the possibilities that the United States could survive with half of
   it's states being free and the other half being slave.  The speech
   was given during that year's Senate races, where he ran against (and
   lost to) Stephen Douglas.


>> Writer Watch

Dale G. Abersold:  This was the first full episode written by Steve
   Tompkins. Previously, he wrote the "Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace"
   segment of "Treehouse of Horror VI" [3F04], and was one of the many
   writers credited with "22 Short Films About Springfield" [3F18].  His
   next assignment is the "Simpson Family Goodtime Variety Hour" segment
   of the "spin-off" episode [4F20], slated to air sometime next spring.

   [{bjr} notes he also was a writer for "The Critic"]


>> Why guest stars should always get their lines right

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  Elizabeth (Liz) Taylor was tapped to be the
   voice of Maggie for her one word in "Lisa's First Word" [9F08].
   Despite the brevity of her part, she reportedly had difficulties with
   it, reading the line more like a twenty-year old seductress than a
   one-year-old baby.  The writers got their revenge in "Krusty Gets
   Kancelled" [9F19]; she's the only guest start too snobby to appear on
   Krusty's comeback show.  Looks like the writing staff retains their
   fascination for Ms. Taylor.


>> Do I sound like a cartoon character?

Mark Aaron Richey:  Woody Allen is an Oscar winning New York-based
   director/actor/writer who makes low-scale comedys, mostly about
   relationships.  Unfortunally for Ned, he is the "nervous" fellow who
   is always in his movies.  Julie Kavner happens to be one of his
   regulars, having shown up in his "Don't Drink the Water", "Shadows
   and Fog", "Alice", "New York Stories", "Radio Days", and "Hannah and
   Her Sisters", and will be in his next film, "Deconstructing Henry"
   (but not "Everyone Says I Love You", which opens this week).


>> So that's what they do when they're not working

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  "American Gladiators" is proof that nothing is
   so strange that it won't work on syndicated television.  Each week,
   the Gladiators (a group of stunt people, professional body builders,
   and other muscular types) dress up in flashy Spandex wrestling
   uniforms, adapt macho nicknames like "Pyro," and compete in tests of
   athletic skill with viewers from home.  Perhaps the most famous game
   from the show is a segment where one Gladiator and one contestant try
   to knock each other off a platform with outsize Q-tips.  

Aaron Varhola:  The device Pyro and Luann ride away in is an
   "Atlasphere", from the event of the same name on the show.
   Atlasphere was a game where the contestants would have to roll the
   Atlasphere over certain points on the floor, while the Gladiators
   (bodybuilders like Pyro) would have to bump the contestants'
   Atlaspheres away from the scoring areas. Essentially, it's humans
   rolling around on huge hamster wheels.

Mark Aaron Richey:  For a time in the early '90's, the show was
   super-popular, and the Gladiators (who all have "cool" one word
   names) popped up all over the place.  The craze has died down
   considerably, but it's still popular.


>> Spalding Gray

Mark Aaron Richey:  Spalding Gray is a monologuist and actor who writes
   and delivers painfully funny monologues about his life.  Several of
   them have been made into movies, including "Swimming to Cambodia",
   "Monster in a Box", and "Gray's Anatomy".  His latest, "It's a
   Slippery Slope", is currently playing on Broadway.

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  His work has evidently captured Matt Groening's
   admiration.  In addition to the mention in tonight's episode, the
   Simpsons' street address in "Kamp Krusty" [8F24] is a tribute to him.


>> I married Marge.  Again and again and again.

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  "I Married Marge" [8F10] showed Homer and Marge
   marrying at Shotgun Pete's quickie wedding chapel.  However, several
   other episodes refer to a more traditional wedding.  This raises the
   question of which version is correct.  According to the episode
   capsules, either "I Married Marge" is an anomaly (since only it had
   the "quickie" wedding story), or the Simpsons had a second wedding.
   Of course, this episode puts the kibosh on the latter theory, while
   the flashback suggests the first story was no anomaly.  Harrumph.
   Maybe there was a third wedding Homer didn't count, since there was
   no prior divorce?

   [I call to all eagle-eyed viewers who'd tell apart Klasky-Csupo and
   Flim Ronan animation anytime: was this a 3rd season outtake or an 8th
   season addition? --ed]


>> Let's make it a week

Dale G. Abersold:  Philip Glass is a composer and performer of
   "minimalist" music.  He is best known for his film scores such as
   "Koyaanisqatsi" and "The Thin Blue Line," as well as his operas,
   including "Einstein on the Beach" and "The Voyage." Funny that Homer
   should mention "just an evening?" when considering "An Evening with
   Philip Glass."  Some of his works can be incredibly long: "Einstein
   on the Beach" lasts six hours.

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  He's known for taking a musical "phrase" of a
   few notes, and playing one variation of this pattern after another
   until you either go nuts or hail him as a musical genius.  Or both.


>> If we can call that "singing"...

Dominik Halas shares with us a few lyrics:

            Can I Borrow A Feeling?

         Can I borrow a feelin'?
         Could you send me a jar of love?
         Hurtin' hearts need some healin',
         Take my hand with your glove of love!

   [anyone knows if this is a take-off of anything? --ed]


>> Loose Ends

Liam J. Scanlan:  "Love is" is a short comic strip featuring two young
   naked kids that highlight that the most important thingin life is
   "Us." It can still be found on coffee mugs.

Mark Aaron Richey:  Scarily enough, Homer described it pretty correctly.
   Two naked children (though I think they are supposed to be older)
   interact in a daily one-panel over a pithy statement.

Mark Aaron Richey:  One of my parent's favorite games, one contestant
   has a limited amount of time to draw something, while the other
   person guesses what it is.  While they never identified the game they
   were playing by name, the board looked exactly like a Pictionary
   board.

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  The Doobie Brothers were a rock band from the
   '70's who had hits with songs like "Black Water."  I think they had a
   reunion tour last year, so maybe their sax player isn't available,
   after all.

Mark Aaron Richey:  Levi's is the largest jean company in the United
   States.

Ricardo Lafaurie:  Is "Starla" supposed to be a hick name?  I knew a
   "Starla" once, and she was anything but.

Dale G. Abersold:  As if the animators didn't have enough trouble
   already making sure that Lisa doesn't eat meat... now they have to
   make sure that the Van Houtens aren't next to each other in crowd
   scenes anymore.

James R. Curry reports that Luanne's whole box-burning "presto-kaboom"
   scene was cut on SKY.

% falls to the floor, eyed by Maggie, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball
% II.  Each of them tenses, prepared for the kill, when suddenly, Homer
% reaches down and secures it with a fork.  "Yoink!"

 Bart: If you really wanted us to be neater, you'd serve us out of one 
       long bowl.
Marge: You're talking about a _trough_.  We're not going to eat from a

       underwear?
 Bart: Hey, this ain't the Ritz.

Marge: [off-screen]  Hello, Marge.  How's the family?

Homer: Keep it down in there, everybody!
-- "A Milhouse Divided"

Marge: Ooh!  A punchbowl like that just screams good taste.  Wouldn't it

Homer: Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here.

%
% Next, she inspects the adorably-dressed children, and gives Bart a

% Marge instructs Bart to take the guests' coats.
  
   Bart: Mom, Reverend Lovejoy doesn't have a coat.  Should I let him 
         in?

         helped myself to a few of the better umbrellas.
-- Turning the other cheek, "A Milhouse Divided"

   Ned: You know, I like his films except for that nervous fellow that's
        always in them.
-- "A Milhouse Divided"

% But something's not right with the Van Houtens.

Luanne: If you want to talk nervous, you should've seen Kirk deal with
        the high-school kids who egged our Bonneville.
  Kirk: Ha.  Should've asked them to hurl some bacon.  Then maybe I
        could have had a decent breakfast for once.
         [long pause, everyone is uneasy]
 Homer: You know what you two need?  A little comic strip called "Love
        Is..."  It's about two naked eight-year-olds who are married.
         [even longer pause]
-- Not Lisa and Ralph, I hope, "A Milhouse Divided"

% Once everyone's done eating, Julius congratulates Marge on the meal,
% but Kirk can only think about stabbing at Luanne, saying he's never
% eaten that well since he was in the army. Once again, everyone is
% uneasy.
%
% After Luanne gets in a quick dig at her husband, Marge loudly suggests

% Next up are the Van Houtens.

   Kirk: Ah, come on Luanne, you know what this is.
 Luanne: Kirk, I don't know what it is.
   Kirk: [sighs] It could not be more simple, Luanne.  You want me to 
         show this to the cat, and have the cat tell you what it is?  
         'Cause the cat's going to get it.
 Luanne: I'm sorry, I'm not as smart as you, Kirk.  We didn't all go to 
         Gudger College.
          [timer dings]
   Kirk: It's dignity!  Gah!  Don't you even know dignity when you see

% Marge tries to cheer up the atmosphere, but it's a desperate cause.

 Kirk: Why don't you tell them one of your little bedtime stories, huh?
       Like the one about how rotten it is to be married to a loser.  Or
       how about the one about how I carry a change purse?  Yeah, a
       purse!
Homer: Shut up and let the woman talk.
-- Aw, we were getting to the good stuff now, "A Milhouse Divided"

 Luanne: Okay, Kirk, I'll tell a story.  It's about a man whose father-
         in-law gave him a sweet job as manager of a cracker factory.
  Homer: Bo-ring.
 Luanne: A man whose complete lack of business sense and managerial 
         impotence...
  Homer: Ooh, here we go!
 Luanne: ...sent the number one cracker factory in town into a tie for

         I _love_ having to steal clothes from the church donation box.
Lovejoy: [quietly] Oh, sweet Jesus.
-- Knowing a little too much, "A Milhouse Divided"
  
% Marge attempts to defuse the situation.

Marge: Lisa, why don't you come sing for us?
 Lisa: [marching and singing] You're a grand old flag...
 Kirk: Oh, great, you got the kid singing.  I hope you're happy now.
-- Another unappreciated talent, "A Milhouse Divided"

% But Luanne is not happy, and has not been for a long time. The time
% has come for...

 Luanne: I want a divorce!
          [everyone gasps]

         [resolute] Sure.  Divorce.  Hey, you got it toots!  And here's
         a picture even _you_ can figure out!
         [draws a circle in a rectangle]  It's a door!  Use it!
  Homer: That's a door?

% Homer, less so.

Marge: I feel terrible.  The Van Houtens split up at our party.
Homer: Marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago.
Marge: I shouldn't have served those North Korean fortune cookies. They
       were so insulting: "You are a coward."  No one likes to hear that

Homer: You can't keep blaming yourself.  Just blame yourself once, and

% there's buns in the cabinet" she comments.  Homer asks her help.

Homer: I know you're only eight years old, and I don't want to put a lot
       of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage!
 Lisa: Oh.  Okay.  Can I stay up?
Homer: [thinks]  All right.
-- Cheap advice, "A Milhouse Divided"

% Homer tells Lisa that he's worried that Marge might be thinking about
% divorce.
 
 Lisa: You've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she stood by 
       you.  Why would she leave you now?
Homer: [frantic] Cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about!
 Lisa: You mean, like your poker shack out in the swamp?
Homer: Uh-huh.
 Lisa: She knows.
-- No Cuban cigars, I hope, "A Milhouse Divided"

% Homer complains that they started off on the wrong foot.  We flashback
% briefly to Marge and Homer's state-line marriage from [8F10].
% Afterwards, we see them sitting outside a truck stop.

Homer: See?  You don't need to spend a lot of money to have a first-
       class wedding reception.
        [open a box, revealing a whale-shaped cake reading "To a Whale
        of a Wife"]
Marge: [sighs]  It's getting less and less likely you're going to yell
       "surprise" and have all my friends jump out.
        [Homer is fascinated by a Levi's truck passing by]
Homer: "Levi's."  Hey, you think that truck is full of jeans?
-- This wouldn't have happened if she'd married Ted Bessell,
      "A Milhouse Divided"

% Back to the present...

 Lisa: You're very lucky to have Mom.  [walks away]
Homer: [pause, dejected]  That's your advice?  Go to bed!
-- You get what you pay for, "A Milhouse Divided"

% Homer thinks a moment about his situation, and gets an idea.  Early
% the next morning, he greets his still-sleeping wife.

Homer: You know, Marge, I was thinking about how much I enjoy your
       interest.  So I wandered over to that theater you went to last
       night and I bought tickets to their entire season.
       Look, "Mostly Madrigals"...  [faking interest]  Yeah, that might
       be good.
       Ooh, ooh, "An Evening with Philip Glass."  [overacting]  Just an
       evening?
       "Voices of the Elderly Poor."  Hmmm...
-- You can throw away your sleeping pills, "A Milhouse Divided"

Marge: Homey, I appreciate this, but I'd really like to get some sleep.
Homer: Oh, of course, my sweet.  I'll just make some soothing ocean
       sounds for you.
       [blows, imitating waves]
       [imitates foghorn]
       [squawks loudly, upsetting Marge]
       [blows again]
       [Long John Silver] Arr, matey!
-- I hate the sea and everything in it, "A Milhouse Divided"

% Homer follows Marge to the hair stylist's ("The Perm Bank"), where he
% begins snipping at her bouffant.  Marge can't believe that he's doing
% something so stupid, and sends him away.  Homer decides that a "few
% clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for ten years of neglect," and
% that Marge deserves a fresh start.
%
% Cut to... Springfield city offices.

Homer: I'd like to file for... divorce.
Clerk: These things happen.  Eight dollars.
-- I wonder when she lost her passion for this work,
      "A Milhouse Divided"

% Marge and the kids return home from the dentist.

Only three cavities, Bart, your best checkup ever!  I'm going to make
you my specialty, butterscotch chicken.
-- Yum, Marge, "A Milhouse Divided"

% From the other room, Homer calls Marge to talk with him.  When she
% steps in, all her friends and relatives jump out.  Surprise!

Homer: Marge, will you marry me?
Marge: Why?  Am I pregnant?
-- The best reason of all, "A Milhouse Divided"

% Homer explains.

Homer: It's a second wedding, honey.  Our first one was so crummy, I had
       to make it up to you.  I really love you.
Marge: Oh, Homey.  I know you love me.  We don't need to get married
       again.
Homer: Yes, we do, I got us a divorce this afternoon.
Marge: What?
Homer: I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV.  
-- A little meta-humor for your enjoyment, "A Milhouse Divided"

% Homer continues that he doesn't want their relationship to end up like
% the Van Houtens.  "It never will," Marge says.

Lovejoy: Dearly beloved...
  Homer: Wait!  I want one last chance to enjoy single life.  [scratches 
         his butt and belches]  Okay, ready.
-- And his single life is different from his married life in what way?,
      "A Milhouse Divided"

I will now read these special vows which Homer has prepared for this 
occasion.  "Do you, Marge, take Homer, in richness and in poorness" --
poorness is underlined -- "in impotence and in potence, in quiet
solitude or blasting across the alkali flats in a jet-powered, monkey-
navigated"... [consults the notecards]  ... and it goes on like this.
-- Rev. Lovejoy officiates the Simpson's wedding, "A Milhouse Divided"  

% Marge says "I will."  After Homer struggles to take off Marge's ring
% and slip it back again ("come on, you stupid..."), Lovejoy pronounces
% them husband and wife.
%
% In the reception, as some jazz band (with a former member of the
% Doobie Brothers) plays, Kirk seizes the opportunity to sing (off-key)
% an awful love song to Luanne.

  Kirk: How about it, Luanne?  Will you marry me... again?
Luanne: Ooh, no!
  Kirk: [moans]  Well... Uh, can I have my shirts back, at least?
 Chase: Okay, you heard the lady.  Why don't you take it outside, all
        right?
  Kirk: Uh, I'll be back.
         [door closes]
  Kirk: [through door] Pro-probably.
-- No Schwartzenegger for ya, "A Milhouse Divided"

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:27]
%
% The theme music plays in the style of a mellow 1970's love ballad.
