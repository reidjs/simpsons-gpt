Maggie's high chair is the wrong scale.  {dh}

Maggie briefly disappears from the kitchen scene.  {dh}

The glasses on the kitchen table are empty in some scenes.  {dh}

Watch the backgrounds in the first scene.  When Bart and Lisa listen to
Homer, the microwave, spoon rack, coffeemaker, and dish rack are behind
and to the left of them.  When Homer is talking, however, the items are
right _behind_ him.

Marge didn't bring her purse to the trade show, so she couldn't have
pulled that celery stick out of it.  {dh}

When Marge's pocket explodes, the pile of candy that falls out of it
disappears.  {ddg}

How did Marge run out with all that candy?  {ddg}

The Pop Rox packet disappears from the top of the pop can when Homer
throws it.

Marge's position in the front room changes after the kids fall out of
her coat.  {dh}

Maggie's position jumps all over the front room in some scenes.  {dh}

Ashley doesn't have her purse in several car scenes.  {dh}

Ending shot of Homer's Under the Sea fantasy shows the family wearing
shoes.  {dh}

The family are in the TV room before "Under the Sea", but are in the
front room afterwards.  {dh}

There exists a Channel 3 News Van, yet Channel 3 is the public access
station.  {ddg}

When Homer is being taped for "Rock Bottom", the clock says 5:01; when
the film is shown, the clock goes back and forth between 1:55 and 2:45
(which also means Homer talked for at least 50 minutes).  {ddg}

There are too many trees around the house in the helicopter shoot.  See
other episodes.  {dh}

The infrared view of the house is slightly incorrect.  {dh}

Homer's hand is at an impossible angle while he stirs his home-made
Prozac.  {dh}

The flag behind Homer has 38 stars, not 49 as Marge said.  {ddg}

The guy on the bicycle can't reach the doorbell, yet he rings it.  {dh}

The front door should open to the right, not the left.  See other
episodes.  {dh}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Peter Kretschman: Seriously, that was probably the best of the new
    episodes I've seen.  I can't remember laughing so hard at a Simpsons
    show in quite some time.  There were just too many great gags!

Jacob Stohler: As I sat watching last night's episode, I had the same
    positive feeling I used to get back in the third, fourth and fifth
    seasons.  I heartily agree that "Homer: Bad Man" was the best this
    season.

Don Del Grande: C-plus - a good episode, with a few laughs, but the
    story just dragged along, and the "Willy with his video tape" ending
    just made the show stop cold as if it had slammed into the side of
    the house.  I'll agree with one thing: the nerds on the Internet are
    not geeks...

Nicole Hudson: All I have to say is "Gentle Ben."  That killed me.  I
    thought I was going to die.

Carl Frank: Kudos to the Simpsons for addressing, with typical humor, a
    current social issue.  That being said, I wish it had been slightly
    more cutting.  The abuse piled against Homer never got too great;
    the conclusion was too easy.  Overall grade: B+

Bruce Schulman: A great episode!  Better than any this season.  I'll
    stay tuned in for next week's edition of ROCK BOTTOM!

Aaron Varhola: The satire in this episode was overpoweringly good; the
    "Rock Bottom" segments were funny because they were TRUE!  The first
    OJ ref as well, and most of the gags worked.  However, the plot
    development was choppy, and Greg Daniels should be made to write on
    the blackboard "I will not use deus ex machina endings."  B/B-.

Chris Courtois: Woo-hoo!!!  That's more like it!!!  This one gets an "A"
    without any hesitation.  This was the first episode since "Selma's
    Choice" where I immediately rewound the tape at 9:00 just to catch
    all the jokes that I missed because I was laughing so hard.

Tony Hill: This episode is worthy of some credit.  It could have been a
    lot better done.  The episode had a disjointed feel to it.  The
    "Rock Bottom" sequences were the highlights.  The O.J. references
    were obviously inserted as afterthoughts.  [...] I give it a C+.

Berrett Rice: This was a definite A+ show.  It was as creative and
    satirical as it has ever been.  The rock bottom sequences were
    hilarious, the story was amusing and it was chock full of classic,
    intelligent humor.

Matthew Kurth: Proof positive that the show is once again headed in the
    right direction.  The "Under The Sea" bit was great, and Homer was
    tolerable for a change.  Not an instant classic, but a good, solid
    episode. 8/10

Yours truly: Yay, a slam of "Hard Copy", my least-favorite show in
    recent years!  Loved "Gentle Ben" talk-show parody, OJ-style
    coverage parody, and "Under the Sea" which joins "The Land of
    Chocolate" as the funniest thirty seconds ever shown on TV.  Sexual
    harassment is timely subject matter, and it was well done.  A
    definite A+.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> "Gentle Ben"

John Laviolette explains the joke about the talk show "Ben": "This is a
    reference to `Gentle Ben,' a show set in the Everglades that aired
    September 10, 1967, to August 31, 1969.  I used to watch that show!
    The stars were Dennis Weaver, Clint Howard (Ron's little brother,)
    and other people who weren't famous.  Also, a bear."

>> "Under the Sea"

Tony Hill writes, "This was an obvious parody of the Academy-award
    winning best song of 1989, from `The Little Mermaid,' music by Alan
    Menken, words by the late Howard Ashman.  The Disney people
    assuredly would not have given permission for Fox to use the song,
    hence this takeoff.  The irony is that the original song tells of
    undersea fish being lucky to not get eaten, while Homer has other
    plans in OFF's version."

>> The freeze-frame of Homer

Matthew Kurth explains, "Assuming Rock Bottom has industry standard
    equipment, the videotape editor did a very poor job on Homer's
    footage.  Industrial VCRs and editing suites have full frame-by-
    frame capabilities, which means that the editor held the interview
    tape in between two frames, which is terribly easy to rectify, you
    just nudge the frame advance control to the next full frame and you
    have a clear picture.  What you cannot eliminate without difficulty
    on a static shot of still video is a slight up and down vibration
    (which is why most frame captures are low-quality), an unnatural
    sense of a lack of motion within the video frame (similar to looking
    at certain computer-rendered graphics), and a pronouncement of
    certain edges (which is due to the previous effect).  The extent of
    this effect varies with equipment age and quality, of course, but
    suffice it to say that any good 4-head VCR you can buy at K-Mart can
    get a better freeze-frame."

       Homer's crime was very great!
        [pause]
       "Great" meaning "large" or "immense",
       We use it in the pejorative sense!
Homer: Marge, I swear I didn't touch her.  You know how bashful I am --
       I can't even say the word "titmouse" without giggling like a
       schoolgirl.  [giggles]
Marge: Er, at any rate, I believe you and I think you should go outside
       and straighten this out.  Some of their chants are very catchy
       and memorable.
-- Who can forget "pejorative"?, "Homer Bad Man"

% Homer walks out, in his bathrobe, to confront them.

Ashley: You grabbed me in the car!
 Homer: Oh, that.  No, I was just grabbing a gummi Venus de Milo that
        got stuck to your pants.
 Woman: Yeah, right.  That's the oldest excuse in the book.
         [crowd boos, hisses]
 Homer: C'mon!  I'm a decent guy.
         [window blows up his bathrobe, uncovering his shame]
         [crows boos, hisses]
-- "Decent" not being the opposite of "indecent", "Homer Bad Man"

% Homer runs back in the house just before being pelted by vegetables
% thrown by the crowd.

 Bart: Why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt?  That's where
       cooties come from!
 Lisa: Dad, I don't understand.  What is she saying you did?
Homer: Well, Lisa, remember that postcard Grampa sent us from Florida of
       that alligator biting that woman's bottom?
 Bart: Oh, yeah, _that_ was _brilliant_!
Homer: That's right, we _all_ thought it was hilarious.  But it turns
       out we were wrong: that alligator was sexually harassing that
       woman.
 Bart: And the dog in the Coppertone ad?  Same deal, Dad?
Homer: Well, there's kind of a grey area.
-- Not in the nineties, there's not, "Homer Bad Man"

% Lisa reassures him, "_We_ know you're innocent, Dad."  Homer thanks
% his children, but Marge observes that the protesters are building a
% shanty-town of tents.  They camp out over night, and the minute Homer
% drives his car out of the garage, the protesters surround him,
% pounding the metal.  "Do your worst, protesters!  You can't stop me
% from living my life!"  The protesters continue to dog him in the
% middle of the freeway, one yelling "No respect for women -- no peace!"

% At his work station, two protesters continue to rock Homer back and

Smithers: [walking in] You people aren't allowed in here.

   Homer: [sullen] It's OK, they're with me.
           [Smithers walks out, everyone starts to yell again]
-- The Geneva protesters' convention, "Homer Bad Man"

% In bed that night, Homer sighs, glad to be finally rid of them.

Homer: They're ruining my whole life.  Marge, please, this is where I
       need you the most: I'm counting on you do to something or say
       something to make it all better.  OK...go!
Marge: Homer --
Homer: [anxious] Uh huh?
Marge: -- I already talked to the indignation coordinator out on the
       lawn today.  I told her you were a decent man, but she wouldn't
       listen.  Besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't
       any more I can do.
Homer: You mean...I'm on my own?  I've never been on my own!  Oh no...on
       own...on own!  I need help...oh, God, help me.  Help me, God!
        [phone rings, Homer answers it very slowly]
Homer: [very slowly] Y'ello?
  Man: Hello, Homer.  This is God...frey Jones from the TV magazine show
       "Rock Bottom".
-- Does the first syllable count?, "Homer Bad Man"

% The scene switches to Jones at his desk.

Jones: We're aware of your problems, and, Mr. Simpson...we want to help.
Homer: Mmm.  I saw that report you did on Sasquatch.  It was fair and
       even-handed.  I'll do it!
-- "Rock Bottom"'s laurels, "Homer Bad Man"

% Homer is interviewed on-camera by Godfrey Jones.

Homer: Ehh, someone had to take the babysitter home.  Then I noticed she
       was sitting on the gummi Venus, so I grabbed it off her.  Oh,
       just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy...[moans lustfully] I
       just wish I had another one right now.  But the most important
       thing is --
Jones: That was really great Mr. Simpson.  We got everything we need.
Homer: OK.  Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch?  I like his
       style.
-- The interview on "Rock Bottom", "Homer Bad Man"

% Homer and the rest of his family watch the report that night on "Rock
% Bottom".

 Homer: Hee hee!  Here comes the bouncing ball of justice!
 Jones: Tonight on "Rock Bottom", we go undercover at a sex farm for sex
        hookers.
Farmer: I keep telling you, I just grow sorghum here.
   Man: Uh huh.  And where are the hookers?
Farmer: [points] 'round back.  [realizes] Whoops.
 Jones: But first:

        She was a university honor student who devoted her life to kids,
         [slomo of Homer reaching for his car keys]

        gave her a crash course in depravity.  "Babysitter and the
        Beast"!

% "Aw, crap," laments Homer as the interview is shown.

Homer: Somebody had to take the babysitter home.  Then I noticed she was
       sitting on [splice] her sweet [splice] can.  [splice] -- o I grab
       her -- [splice] sweet can.  [splice] Oh, just thinking about
       [splice] her [splice] can [splice] I just wish I had he --
       [splice] sweet [splice] sweet [splice] s-s-sweet [splice] can.
Jones: So, Mr. Simpson: you admit you grabbed her can.  What do you have
       to say in your defense?
Homer: [looking lustful in a clearly-paused VCR shot]
Jones: Mr. Simpson, your silence will only incriminate you further.
        [paused shot of Homer grows larger]
       No, Mr. Simpson, don't take your anger out on me.  Get back!  Get
       back!  Mist -- Mr. Simpson -- nooo!
  Man: [quickly] Dramatization -- may not have happened.
-- High-quality "Rock Bottom" journalism, "Homer Bad Man"

Homer: [fearfully] Marge?  Kids?  Everything's going to be just fine.
       No go upstairs, and pack your bags...we're going to start a new
       life...under the sea.
        [calypso music starts]
        [Homer dances with fish as Lisa plays a seahorse saxophone,
       Marge a squid harp, and Bart the xylophone clams]
Homer: [eats a dancing fish, sings]
       Under the sea, under the sea,

Marge: Homer, that's your solution to everything: to move under the sea.
       It's not going to happen!
Homer: Not with _that_ attitude!
-- The little Homer mermaid, "Homer Bad Man"

Marge: Look, maybe this whole thing will blow over.
        [helicopters swoop over the house; news vans pull up]
Homer: It didn't blow over, Marge.  Nothing _ever_ blows over for me.
        [the car gets flipped by the wind from the helicopters]
-- They only blow over literally, "Homer Bad Man"

% The next morning, Homer gets out of the shower to see helicopters
% looking into his bathroom window.  He panics and slips as cameras
% flash.  The picture appears on the news that night.

Newsman: Simpson scandal update: Homer sleeps nude in an oxygen tent
         which he believes gives him sexual powers.
  Homer: Hey -- that's a half-truth!

  Woman: {[weeping] I don't know Homer Simpson, I -- I never met Homer
         Simpson or had any contact with him, but -- [cries

Announcer: Today on "Ben": mothers and runaway daughters reunited by

           Ben.
            [a bear wearing a helmet with a microphone runs out]
  Woman 1: I just have one thing to say: let's have less Homer Simpson
           and more money for public schools.
            [smattering of applause; Ben growls]
  Woman 2: Ben, I have a question --
            [Ben runs over to tables piled with food]

Announcer: And now we return to "Fox Night at the Movies": "Homer S.:
           Portrait of an Ass-Grabber", starring Dennis Franz.
    Homer: Ooh, "portrait"!  Sounds classy.  [looks at family, who look
           away] Doesn't it?
            [on screen, Franz laughs as he drives through a line of
           parking meters while the babysitter screams]
            [a cat cleans itself in the middle of the road]

  "Homer": I don't care.  [runs it over]
            [crashes into some garbage bins]
  "Homer": Now I'm going to grab me some _sweet_.
 "Ashley": No, Mr. Simpson, that's sexual harassment.  If you keep it

           likely!  [laughs more]
-- Unbiased media coverage, as usual, "Homer Bad Man"

% On another channel, Kent Brockman commentates from a helicopter.

Kent: This is hour 57 of our live, round-the-clock coverage outside the
      Simpson estate.  Remember, by the way, to tune in at 8:00 for
      highlights of today's vigil, including when the garbage man came
      and when Marge Simpson put the cat out...possibly because it was
      harassed, we don't know.
      Of course, there's no way to see into the Simpson home without
      some kind of infrared heat-sensitive camera.  So, let's turn it
      on.
       [screen shows blue house, orange Simpsons watching TV]
      Now, this technology is new to me, but...I'm pretty sure that's
      Homer Simpson in the oven, rotating slowly.  [closeup of turkey]
      His body temperature has risen to over 400 degrees -- he's
      literally stewing in his own juices.
       [in the studio] Now, here are some results from our phone-in
      poll: 95% of the people believe Homer Simpson is guilty.  Of
      course, this is just a television poll which is not legally
      binding, unless proposition 304 passes.  And we all pray it will.
-- Channel Six's coverage, "Homer Bad Man"

% Homer mourns.

 Homer: Oh...I don't have a friend in the world.
   Moe: [outside] Let us through!
Barney: [outside] ...Homer's true friends!
 Marge: Oh, _really_?
   Moe: Come on, let us through, you vultures!
 Homer: Oh, Marge, it's a miracle.
   Moe: How can you judge this man without talking to the people who
        know him best?  _We_ got the real dirt on Homer Simpson, and the
        bidding starts at ten G's!
 Man 1: I bid ten G's!
 Man 2: Ten-five G's!
-- Homer's true materialistic friends, "Homer Bad Man"

% Homer closes the curtain dejectedly.

    Homer: Aw, I need a hug.
            [everyone pauses, then hugs him]
           How come you guys hesitated?
     Lisa: Sorry, Dad, we _do_ believe in you, we really do.
     Bart: It's just hard not to listen to TV: it's spent so much more
           time raising us than you have.
    Homer: Oh, maybe TV _is_ right.  TV's _always_ right!  [walks
           upstairs]

             [music starts, audience laughs]
             [changes channel to Chespirito who gets his butt pinched]
Chespirito: Aie aie aie!  Es Homer Simpson.  Me ha molestado!  Oh!
            {[the flower he was smelling wilts]}
     Homer: {Oh, I like it better when they're making fun of people who
            _aren't_ me.}  [gasps] I know, "Evening at the Improv".
            They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s.  [flips]
  Comedian: See, I think about weird stuff.  Like, what would happen if
            E.T. and Mr. T had a baby?  Heh, well, you'd get Mr. E.T.,
            wouldn't you?  And you know, I think he'd sound a little
            something like this: "I pity the fool who doesn't phone
            home."  [audience laughs]
     Homer: [laughs] Ooh, I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now.
-- Relief from the Homer Simpson fiasco, "Homer Bad Man"

% Marge rushes in.

Marge: Homer!  Homer, the kids have a great idea how you can clear your
       name.
 Lisa: The media's making a monster out of you because they don't care
       about the truth!  All they care about is entertainment.  Well,
       _you_ need a forum where they don't even know the _meaning_ of
       the word "entertainment": public access television.
Homer: Aw, but those shows all look so crummy.
Marge: Well we could dress it up a bit...we can bring a fern, and a
       folding chair from the garage, and the most decorative thing of
       all -- the truth!
        [everyone looks at her]
-- Marge, interior decorator, "Homer Bad Man"

% Inside a studio at Channel Three, Abe helps them decorate by hanging a

% The camera rolls.

 Lisa: And now it's time for the Innocence Report with Homer Simpson.
       [holds sign: "Innocence Report"]
Homer: Hello.  I am Homer Simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed
       me, Father Goose.  You know, everybody believed the worst about
       me right away; nobody cares that I didn't do it.  But I didn't!
       OK, look: I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing
       women is not one of them.  [softly] Like one time, we were having
       this race with the stupid old tiny bicycle with the big wheel in
       front, so I figure, "We'll see about that!"  So I get this big
       chunk of cinderblock, and --
Marge: [makes choking noises]
Homer: Oh, gotta go.  [walks off]

% Homer is despondent.

Homer: [stirring a bowl] Aw, Marge, this is so depressing, my only hope

         [kicks Homer in the face, rides off]
         [doorbell rings again; Homer answers]
 Willy: Homer!  I _love_ amateur video, and your show is the most
        amateur video I ever saw.  My hobby is secretly videotaping
        couples in cars.  I dinna come forward because in this country,
        it makes you look like a pervert -- but _every_ single Scottish
        person does it!
         [puts in videotape]
Quimby: [on TV] Oh baby, oh yeah, oh baby --
 Willy: Aw, no, that's Mayor Quimby.  [fast forwards] Ah, here we go.
 Homer: [on TV] Precious Venus...[gargles]
Ashley: Aah!  [slams door, runs off]
 Homer: Thank you!  [eats gummi Venus]
  Lisa: Dad, this clears you completely!
 Marge: You know, the courts might not work any more, but as long as
        everybody is videotaping everyone else, justice will be done.
-- A sad comment on American society, "Homer Bad Man"

% Homer takes the tape to the women's dorm at Springfield University.

 Homer: You're _both_ right.
-- Homer's innocence, stored on video, "Homer Bad Man"

% On "Rock Bottom", Godfrey Jones is apologetic.

   Jones: In our mad pursuit of the scoop, we members of the press
          sometimes...make mistakes.  "Rock Bottom" would like to make
          the following corrections.
           [a list scrolls by very, very quickly]
    Bart: Wow!  V8 juice _isn't_ one-eighth gasoline.
   Homer: And Ted Koppel _is_ a robot!
    Lisa: There's you, Dad!
Everyone: Yay!
   Jones: Tomorrow, on "Rock Bottom":
           [slomo of Willy walking into Godfrey's office] he's a
          foreigner who takes perverted videos of you when you least
          expect it.  He's "Rowdy Roddy Peeper"...
   Homer: Oh, that man is _sick_!
   Marge: Groundskeeper Willy saved you, Homer.
   Homer: But listen to the music!  He's evil!
   Marge: Hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything
          you hear?
   Homer: Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing.
