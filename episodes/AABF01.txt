Blackboard:     Bart paints "Treehouse of Horror IX" on the blackboard with a
                blood-soaked brush.  He keeps his blood refills in a plastic
                jack-o-lantern bucket normally reserved for Halloween treats.

       go trick-or-treating (as opposed to their reactions in THoH II & III)?
   ... apparently, the Simpsons' remote control is probably the VCR's remote
       (given the remote's VCR button controls and that their TV set has

       patients?

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  You can rely on Simpsons Hallowe'en specials being strong,
   and 1998 is no exception.  "Hell Toupee": Forgettable, but hey, it's only
   one segment.  "Tiny Toon": Nice mayhem, and some good cartoonish humor.
   "Starship Poopers": A miniature masterpiece, with some brilliant social
   satire.  (A-)

Brad Bizzolt:  I hardly have any DYNs from "Starship Poopers" because I spent
   the entire time trying to avoid crying from laughing so hard.  It's a shame
   when an episode is so funny that you end up missing half of it.  Well, not
   a shame in the technical sense ... anyway, this year's THOH was probably my
   favourite of the lot so far. Everything was ridiculously far-fetched
   (something I demand from these eps), Homer was at his funniest, the opening
   scene which mimicked itself completely was truly inspired, etc.  Kang &
   Kodos weren't quite as funny as they've been in previous appearances, but
   that certainly isn't going to stop me from giving this glowing review.  (A)

Anthony Dean:  A fairly amusing outing this year, with some rather funny
   jokes, such as the dead-on parody of Jerry Springer, Krusty's "I'm going to
   suck" bit and Maggie-the-alien's antics.  Weak spots: the animation (yes, I
   know I've been harping on this for the past half-dozen episodes or so, but
   it's true; the difference between THoH VIII's and IX's animation quality in
   tonight's airing is pretty noticeable).  (B+)

Jeff Dean:  "Treehouse Of Horror IX" was well worth the wait.  Excellent plot
   lines were backed up with great writing in each of the segments.  A gaggle
   of guest voices and a brief live action segment make this one my favorite
   Simpsons Halloween special.  I never thought I'd say this again, but one of
   the best episodes ever.  (A+)

Don Del Grande:  I'll let you know when I stop laughing ... (insert long pause
   here) ... okay: A -- too bad they can't all be Halloween specials.  And
   even if they could, too bad they can't all be like this one.  Even what
   looked like a "happy" ending turned out good in the end ...  (A)

Yuri Dieujuste:  This was a well written Treehouse of Horror ep.  It is not
   the best written but it makes up for weeks of no new episodes.  Hell Toupee
   was pretty good, The Terror of Tiny Toon was below grade and overhyped,
   while Starship Pooper was the best piece of the pie.  (A)

Jordan Eisenberg:  A laugh-fest right from the start, "Treehouse of Horrors
   IX" is probably the best first impression the new production line of
   episodes could have made.  The first two acts were funny, witty,
   fast-paced, intelligent and well-plotted, while the third act was held back
   only by its reminder of the "new" Simpsons trademarks; sex, potty humor and
   bleepity-bleep-bleeeeeeeeeep-bleeping language.  Still, if only half of a
   third of the show don't fit (and I can hardly think it even qualifies as a
   disappointment nowadays [rolls his eyes] ... ), you must acquit.  A
   Simpsons Halloween show has yet to disappoint me.  (A-)

Jeremy Gallen:  IMHO, an okay episode.  I liked the Halloween-altered opening.
   A first for the Simpsons!  The first segment opened up fine, but the
   Homer-murdering-Bart-while- acting-as-Snake thing was a little squeamish
   for me, though.  I liked the next two segments.  They cracked me up!  This
   episode deserves a  (B)

Andrew Gill:  This was a good episode.  I found myself thinking at some points
   about how uncreative the writing was, but on the whole, it wasn't too bad.
   I think that I may have even laughed once (I don't usually laugh at
   *anything*, even The Simpsons).  (B)

Darrel Jones:  A great Halloween special!  Better than the last two
   disappointments.  Not as good as THOH V or THOH VI, however.  "Hell Toupee"
   could have been shortened, but the three strikes joke was great.  "The
   Terror of Tiny Toon" was best; the highlight was the fate of Itchy &
   Scratchy.  "Starship Pooper" was the best one, though.  And I loved the
   killing of politicians.  Overall, a solid  (A)

Haynes Lee:  A good THOH series but I was very disappointed that Phil
   Hartman's last rendition of Lionel Hutz was wasted.  Lastly  it looks like
   rate the scene with Regis & Kathie Lee was done at the last minute.  (B-)

Tom Rinschler:  As usual, this year's annual Halloween episode was a showpiece
   for the series.  The opening credits parody was too funny, and had me ROFL
   harder than I had for a long time.  "Hell Toupee" was OK, but nothing
   special, but "The Terror of Tiny Toon" really picked up the pace ("Lisa,
   we're characters in a cartoon!"). "  Starship Pooper" was excellent as
   well, combining good laughs with pointed satire.  (A)

Aaron Varhola:  The best THoH since IV.  One good and two excellent segments;
   the two excellent ones show a good knowledge of cartoon physics and a
   successful parody of something unparodyable: Jerry Springer.  "Hell
   Toupee": Kind of obvious at times, as Marge told Lisa, but witty and
   entertaining.  B.  "The Terror of Tiny Toon": A good knowledge of cartoon
   physics, a lot of good gags, and Poochie dying a well-deserved death.  A+.
   "Starship Pooper":  Excellent gags, good use of Maggie, and what seemed
   impossible: parody of Jerry Springer through exaggeration.  A+.  Overall:
   (A+)

Yours Truly:  Another good installment on the "Treehouse of Horror" series,
   although it was a little short of living up to the hype.  The
   alternate-world "Terror of Tiny Toon" was the best, but "Starship
   Troopers", which spoofs alien abductions and the talk shows that broadcast
   them, comes close.  "Hell Toupee" was one of the better starting segments,
   and has some unexpectedly clever jokes.  I don't feel the writers got
   everything out of three strong premises that they could have, but the show
   was a treat, anyway.  (A-)

AVERAGE GRADE:  A- (3.51)   Std Dev.: 0.6057   (23 reviews computed)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Meta-Reference corner

As she turns off the TV, Marge asks what kind of mother she'd be if she let
   her children watch "gruesome Halloween cartoons."  {ag}  ["I wonder if that
   prompted any quickie soul-searching."  {bjr}]

   After dropping into Itchy and Scratchy's world Lisa realizes, "We're
   characters in a cartoon."  {ddg}


>> Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace

Joe Klemm talks about that scary bad guy, Freddy Krueger:  Robert Englund is
   the man behind Freddy Krueger, the monster from the Nightmare on Elm Street
   films.  Indeed, he reprises his role of Freddy in the couch gag, which may
   also be a reference to the upcoming Freddy Vs. Jason film.


Brad Bizzolt chips in with:  I was about to add a line like "I bet he's happy
   to have his career back for 3 more seconds!", but I figured I better check
   my stats before making that accusation.  Boy, would my face have been red;
   Apparently, this guy -has- been busy in recent years, appearing in multiple
   horror films each year, including some bigger recent flicks like "Urban
   Legend" and "Strangeland," and indeed this forthcoming "Freddy V. Jason"
   movie.


>> Fun With the Electric Chair

Aaron Varhola:  What happened to Snake HAS happened during modern executions.
   That's why the states that still use the electric chair (Florida, Georgia,
   Virginia, Indiana and Nebraska) usually have the execution chamber well-
   vented.  Still, carelessness has caused at least two prisoners to catch on
   fire in recent years.  (See David von Drehle's book "Among the Lowest of
   the Dead" for a detailed description of Florida's capital punishment
   procedures, including the various mistakes, innocent and insane men
   executed, and the fascinating culture of Death Row.  Among the first thing
   they do is shave the prisoner's head, as has been mentioned before).
   [Interesting point to make, given the short's subject matter -- Ed.]


>> "My face!  My valuable face!"

Haynes Lee:  Matt Groening said he would never have Homer strike Bart, but
   throttle his neck instead. Homer punched Bart several times in the face.


A few people thought that scene was disturbing.  Liz McAuley addresses their
   concerns:  Somebody else posted here (in a capsule submission I think) that
   Matt Groening had stated that he would never show Homer striking Bart.  I
   meant to comment on that ...

   Homer hitting Bart in this episode doesn't disturb me, because of the
   context of the scene.  First off, this is a Halloween episode, so
   continuity is ignored.  You could argue that Matt's "rules" regarding
   Homer's behavior hold for all the regular episodes, but not for the
   Halloween ones.

   Second, and most importantly, Homer wasn't striking Bart in anger.  Now
   *that* would have disturbed me.  Homer was simplemindedly trying to attack
   the killer toupee, which unfortunately had attached itself to Bart's face.

   I can understand why that scene would upset people.  There's a big
   difference though in Homer "accidentally" punching Bart, and Homer
   purposely hitting Bart when Homer gets frustrated or mad at Bart.  The
   latter would definitely be disturbing.


>> Coming up next ... Dom DeLouise interviews himself!

Joe Klemm talks about those scary talk show hosts, Regis and Kathie Lee:
   Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford are the hosts of a daily talk show on
   syndication.  While Regis is more known for the talk show circuit, Kathie
   Lee is known for being Frank Gifford's wife, Carnival Cruise Line, and
   sweatshop made clothes.


>> No Exit

Bob Beecher explains why Lisa asked Homer to press the nonexistent "exit"
   button on the remote:  In the original script, Homer was using an on-screen
   menu and Lisa tells him to push Exit.  That would be "exit from the menu".
   The menu was never animated.  They could have recorded a cover ADR read of
   Lisa yelling "Push Eject!" but I guess no one thought of it!


>> Springfield eludes us once more

C. Armour-Kidson saw something surprising:  During the latest Halloween
   special, I noticed that when Maggie communicates with Kang, the concentric
   circles, representative of the source of a broadcast transmission, appear
   to emanate from Louisiana.


Jordan Eisenberg rebuts:  According to the spot on the globe from which Maggie
   was transmitting signals to Kang and Kodos, Springfield is in the area of
   the country just above the Gulf of Mexico, possibly in Mississippi or
   Alabama.  [Or maybe Louisiana -- Ed.]

   There are probably a few people jumping for joy and kissing their VCRs
   right now, claiming to have found Springfield.  I apologize, but I must
   burst this blasphemous bubble of bubbly brain ... blessing ... bonanza!
   The "Treehouse of Horrors" series is, by law, inconclusive of any facts,
   important or superficial pertaining to The Simpsons, its network or any of
   its affiliates.  In other words, your long searches are not finally over.


Ondre Lombard adds fuel to the "Where is Springfield" fire:  The Jerry
   Springer Show is also taped in Chicago, Illinois.  Either we can assume his
   show is a hop skip and a jump away from Springfield, or the family actually
   flew out to appear on the show.


>> "We should've have gone on 'Rosie,' instead"

Benjamin Robinson:  I'd say "Starship Troopers" was a fine spoof of talk
   shows, except that the shows aren't that much tamer in reality.  I'll
   confess that I know Jerry Springer mainly by reputation, but I've watched
   enough of these media circuses to tell you that the difference between
   Springer, Montel, and Ricki Lake is largely a matter of degree.

   For those of you who don't live where these shows are syndicated, here's a
   quick rundown.  Booking agents employed by the shows look for guests with a
   story to tell, and the stranger and/or tawdrier the better.  (Springer once
   actually had guests who believed they were from another planet, so "alien
   custody battle" wouldn't be new territory for him.)  Conflict builds
   ratings, so fights -- verbal and otherwise -- between guests are
   encouraged.  Jerry Springer's people were caught =staging= fights
   beforehand, although that didn't dent the show's appeal in the long run.
   Audience participation is also a Good Thing, so the host will take a
   microphone into the bleachers and let the audience members fire insults at
   the guests.  Finally, the host will offer some pat "resolution" for a
   veneer of respectability.  Once in a great while this is kind of
   entertaining, but after a while it's just sad.  Kang probably did the
   audience a favor when he zapped them.


Ondre Lombard:  Am I the only one who finds the sudden exposure of "The Jerry
   Springer Show" annoying?  And not just because the fact that trailer trash
   having illiterate arguments with each other is passing for entertainment
   makes me sick to my stomach, but also because Springer's show has been
   around for 8 years, since 1991, and I even remember seeing the show once or
   twice in the early 90s when it started.  In fact, "spontaneous" fights had
   been going on his show a while before this sudden mass media exposure.  The
   only reason his show has surged in popularity is because he started
   releasing a videotape called "Too Hot For TV" which would feature graphic
   material, including nudity that would often need to be censored graphically
   on the show.  Suddenly, his show started climbing in the ratings, and
   everyone became aware of him as if he just recently came out.  Although,
   still, I guess I'm more annoyed by the fact that when his show had some
   vague sense of order and did more than cover issues no civilized person can
   relate to (and it did, because that's why there ever was a need for a
   "Final Thought," as his show actually did complex issues), no one watched,
   and that a human circus is more appealing.


Benjamin Robinson again:  Talk shows of this kind aren't a recent phenomenon.
   Donahue pioneered many of the fundamentals (provocative topics, letting the
   audience ask questions) over twenty years ago, but conducted the show with
   a measure of civility.  The mass descent into bad taste is the recent
   phenomenon.  Morton Downey Jr. had a brief run as the talk show "bad boy"
   in the late Eighties, but petered out.  So did Geraldo, who is most noted
   for having a chair broken across his nose.  Jerry Springer is the latest in
   the line of TV enfants terribles, and he will probably not be the last.

   Bonus Springer trivia:  Before hitting the TV circuit, Springer was once a
   mayor.  He wasn't in charge of a little backwater, either; it was the city
   of Cincinnati (or possibly Cleveland, I forget which), Ohio.  I suppose
   after the experiencing the political arena, daytime talk shows probably
   weren't that different.


Alex Flandonwittsy adds:  Springer(while Mayor) helped save an old train
   station from destruction, and it was formed into the Cincinnati museum(I
   live in Ohio but I forgot the name ... :) ).  If it weren't for Springer
   and some fellow protesters, this cherished, legendary station would have
   been demolished and made into something else.  Now, it still looks like it
   self from years past but has many exhibits and historical places inside.
   So, the guy is not all bad.  :)

   [Alex also says, "he [Springer] was also a TV anchor man for WLWT after he
   was done with politics."]


Tom Rinschler adds:  The train station is Union Terminal, and I pass it every
   day going to work. And  it really has been coolly refurbished, with all the
   various museums inside.  Moreover, Amtrak moved back into the station once
   it ceased to be a decaying husk, so now it even has its old function back.

   And to answer other things brought up on this thread, Jerry Springer was
   indeed Mayor of Cincinnati [from 1977 to 1981, according to someone called
   "Bill" -- Ed.], but was basically kicked off city council after a rather
   embarrassing sex scandal.  He had been apparently crossing over to
   Covington KY to solicit prostitutes, but was caught in an embarrassing way:
   the check he wrote to one bounced!

   (And he was nutty in other ways too:  he once hijacked a city bus and made
   the driver take him where he anted, claiming as mayor he had the right!)


>> Almost forgot Ken Starr

Jordan Eisenberg:  Bart's line at the end was obviously added in after
   production was complete.  We don't see him move at all, it was unnaturally
   speeded up, and the reference is relatively to up-to-date to have been
   recorded back with the rest of the footage.


>> The girl of a thousand voices

For someone who supposedly doesn't talk, Maggie has an awful lot of voice
   credits, as Brian Rawson-Ketchum notes:  Including [James Earl] Jones and
   [Elizabeth] Taylor, there are *six* people who've voiced Maggie.  The
   others are Yeardley Smith ("Bart vs. Thanksgiving," blames Bart for her not
   being able to talk in his fantasy), Nancy Cartwright ("My Sister, My
   Sitter," she makes basic baby noises), Nancy's daughter Lucy ("Lisa's
   Substitute," she made Maggie's cry when Homer comes to check on her), and
   most recently Dan Castellaneta, who provided her Kodos-like voice at the
   end of the episode.  [Chad Lehman says Harry Shearer did this, and I agree

   straight from the Nancy Cartwright web site.


Jordan Eisenberg:  Matt Groening also provided Maggie's sucking sound, which
   has been replayed using a synthesizer since then.  [Dale Abersold says it's
   Gabor Csupo.]


[In addition, The Maggie File at <http://www.snpp.com/guides/maggie.file.html>
   credits Liz Georges for Maggie's voice on the rare occasions she spoke in
   the Ullman-era shorts.  It also counts Danny DeVito's "baby translator"
   voice.  This brings the total up to a surprising ten people -- Ed.]


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  THOHIX


Haynes Lee:  Matt Groening said he would never have Homer strike Bart, but
   throttle his neck instead.  Homer punched Bart several times in the face.


Brian Rawson-Ketchum:  Phil Donahue at one time wanted to broadcast an
   execution on his show. It was to occur in North Carolina, but plans fell
   through, and the show didn't air.  IIRC, a judge wouldn't allow the
   broadcast to occur.


Benjamin Robinson:  Al Jean was credited as "Al 'I Murdered Mike Reiss' Jean"?
   (Now we know what happened to him ...)

> Quotes and Scene Summary  {bjr}
==============================================================================
% Another fall afternoon at Springfield Elementary finds Bart Simpson
% engaged in his after-school punishment.  This time, he has to write
% "The Simpsons Halloween Special IX."  Instead of the usual chalk, Bart
% chooses to write the message in blood (dipping the brush into a jack-o-
% lantern bucket when it's time for a refill).  When the bell rings, he
% tosses the brush down and gleefully runs out of the building.
%
% At home, Homer pulls into the driveway.  Bart skateboards in from the
% right, jumps the retaining wall, and bounces off the roof of Homer's
% car only to land with a thud in the driveway.  Lisa races in on her
% bike and slams into Bart's broken body.  The impact launches her from
% her bike, and Lisa is firmly lodged into the wall of the garage, just
% above the door.  Marge cheerily drives in, beeping her horn, but Homer
% is too slow in getting out of the way.  He becomes a permanent hood
% ornament for Marge's car.
%
% Meanwhile, in the Simpson living room Freddie Krueger and Jason
% Voorhees wait vainly for the family to arrive.  Freddie glances at his
% watch, and says they should have arrived by now.  Jason just shrugs
% and takes things in stride.
%
% A grim demise for the long-running series?  No, no, my friend.  It is
% only the start -- of "Treehouse of Horror IX."
%
% The curtain rises on our first macabre tale, which we call:
%
%                              Hell Toupe
%
% It's business as usual in the Kwik-E-Mart.  Snake saunters by the
% display of pocket combs.  He plucks one off the rack, dips it in a vat
% of oily cheese, and uses the concoction to slick back his hair.  The
% comb passes the audition.

Snake:    Yo, ring 'er up, dude.
          [hands Apu the comb, and then withdraws a cigarette from his
          pack]
Apu:      [gasps]  You cannot smoke in here, sir.  Please, the sign is
          clearly posted, sir.
          [points to a tiny "No Smoking" sign lost in a sea of
          cigarette ads]
Moe:      [coughs] Aw, God, you smokers disgust me.  [to Apu]  Hey,
          'Pu, you got a breakfast cereal for people with syphilis?
-- Disgust in the eye of the beholder,

% Suddenly, Chief Wiggum bursts through the front door, gun drawn.

Wiggum:   Hands up, scuzzbag!  [Moe raises his hands in surrender]
          Nah, not you, the smoking scuzzbag.
Snake:    [raises his hands, and flicks away cigarette] Yo, chill out
          dude, I'll pay the fine.
Wiggum:   Not this time, you won't; this is your third strike.  First
          you torched that orphanage, then you blew up that bus full of
          nuns ...
Snake:    Hey, that was self-defense!
Wiggum:   Well, you'll be seeing lots of nuns where you're going, pall:
          Hell!  Because the penalty for strike three is death.
          [handcuffs Snake]
Snake:    Oh, you'll never make it stick, chief.
Wiggum:   Will, too, because this place is full of witnesses -- Apu,
          that scuzzbag Moe ...
Snake:    I'm not going to forget this, dudes.  I'm going to totally
          kill both of you.
Wiggum:   And, uh, don't forget Bart Simpson.  [points to Bart, hiding
          behind a videogame]  He's a witness too, right, Barty?
Bart:     Oh...
Snake:    You are *so* dead, little dude.
Bart:     Thanks a lot, chief.
Wiggum:   [tousles Bart's hair]  Heh, ha, you kids crack me up.

% The wheels of justice turn true to Wiggum's word.  As always, the Fox
% network is there to cover the news with their unique brand of
% journalism.
%
% The show starts with former "Tonight" sidekick Ed McMahon standing in
% front of a curtain.

McMahon:       Hi, I'm Ed McMahon.  Tonight on Fox, from the producers
               of "When Skirts Fall Off," and "Secrets of National
               Security Revealed," it's, "World's Deadliest
               Executions."
               [curtains part, revealing an electric chair.  The
               audience cheers wildly]
               Making his first appearance on our show, heeeere's
               Snake!
               [two dancing girls and Chief Wiggum lead Snake into the
               room, as the audience boos]
Snake:         [to the dancing girls] Thank you, chickie-pies.

               home]
Homer:         The chair?  Ohh ... how come they only do crucifixions
               during sweeps?
               [back to Springfield prison, where Snake is being seated
               for the last time]
Announcer:     Snake played lacrosse at Ball State University.
Wiggum:        So long, Snake.  You'll never harm another person with
               second-hand smoke.
               [pulls switch.  Snake is jolted with electricity.  Smoke
               from his body fills the execution chamber, causing
               everyone to have a coughing fit.]
Snake:         [weakly] Dude ... [dies]
McMahon:       Hi-yoooo!
Wiggum:        All right, now let's get this carcass over to the
               hospital and carve it up for organs.
Barney:        [stands up in the gallery]  Dibs on the liver!
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% At that moment, the phone rings in the Simpson's house.  By amazing
% coincidence, a donor for Homer's operation has just that moment become
% available.
%
% Homer meets with Dr. Nick Riviera at his seedy medical office.

Riviera:  Boy, you're getting the transplant just in time, Homer.
          [holds up what is obviously Snake's scalp]  This is genuine
          human hair.
Homer:    This is legal, right?
Riviera:  [pause] Yeah, sure, whatever.
          [holds up a syringe]  These drugs will make the operation
          seem like a beautiful dream.
          [punches Homer to knock him out, and then injects himself]
          [dreamily]  Ah ... hi, everybody.
          [picks up a pizza cutter and goes to work on Homer's head]
-- Does his HMO cover that?  "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% At home, Homer shows his family their "sexy new daddy."  The family
% admires Homer's new head of lush hair.  Marge likens him to movie star
% Roger Moore -- only with his fly open.  It looks like Homer's hair
% troubles are finally behind him.
%
% Yet, a good night's rest still eludes Homer, and he tosses and turns
% in bed.  Tendrils from Snake's former hair worm their way into Homer's
% brain.  On its own, Homer's hair re-arranges itself into Snake's
% vaguely threatening style.  Homer awakes, dresses, and quietly slips
% out of the bedroom.
%
% Homer shows up at the Kwik-E-Mart.

Apu:      Ooh!  Ooh-la-la, Simpson.  What can I do for you and your new
          'do?
Homer:    [Snake's voice] You sent me to the chair.
Apu:      [gasps] Snake?  But you're dead!
Homer:    I know you are, but what am I?
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Homer, under Snake's control, picks the screaming Apu up and hauls
% him to the Squishee machine.
%
% Cut to the evening news with Kent Brockman.

Brockman: [grave] ... and the fluffy kitten played with that ball of
          string all through the night.  [brightens]  On a lighter
          note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.
Simpsons: [gasps and cries of disbelief]
Marge:    That's horrible!  Who'll run the Kwik-E-Mart?
          [the news goes on the scene with Chief Wiggum]
Wiggum    [drinking a Squishee] I'm afraid we have no leads, but I can
          safely say Apu did not suffer.
Lou:      [indicating Apu's legs sticking out of the top of the
          Squishee machine]
          Looks to me like he suffered a lot, Chief.
Wiggum:   Aw, Jeez, Lou, how long were you going to let me keep
          drinking this thing?  [drinks some more of the Squishee]
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Lisa wonders out loud who could commit such a murder.  As if in
% answer, Homer's hair shifts into Snake-mode.
%
% The next morning, Moe is just sitting down to a breakfast of Penecill-
% O's, when Homer walks in.  He picks up a corkscrew and jams it into
% Moe's chest.  Pulling it out, Homer shows Moe his own heart ("Yoink").
% Moe isn't that impressed, and collapses face-first into his cereal
% bowl.
%
% Once again, it's up to Brockman to break the news to the town.

Brockman:      And another of Springfield's beloved citizens was
               murdered today.  Filthy old bartender Moe Syzslak has
               watered down his last highball.
Bart:          Oh, my God.  Everyone Snake swore revenge on is being
               murdered!
Marge:         It's almost as if he's killing from beyond the grave.
Lisa:          I told you capital punishment isn't a deterrent.
Bart:          Don't you get it?  He swore to kill me, too -- I'm next!
Homer:         [putting his arm around Bart] Don't worry, I'll protect
               you.  [Snake voice]  Little dude.
-- I've got a bad feeling about this, "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Homer figures the best way to save Bart is to barricade his bedroom
% door.  He nails up some boards to the door with a sledgehammer.
% "There, now no murderers can get in," Homer says.  Then, in Snake's
% voice, he adds, "or out."  Bart ducks the first swing of Homer's
% hammer, and it sails into the headboard.  The second swing finds
% Bart's Krusty doll.  The third try appears to find it's mark, but we
% see that Homer has only managed to smash Bart's school picture.
% Several more blows just barely miss their mark.

Bart:     [pounding on door]  Help!  Dad's trying to kill me!
Homer:    It's Hammer time, snitchy.  [swing and a miss, this time
          bashing a gaping hole in the door]
Bart:     That's Snake's voice!
          [Lisa and Marge (carrying Maggie) climb in through the hole
          in the door]
Lisa:     Of course -- the transplant!  Somehow Snake's hair must be
          controlling ...
Marge:    [interrupts] Oh, please, Lis, everyone's already figured that
          out.
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Homer closes in for the kill.

Bart:     You've got to fight the hair, dad.
Homer:    But I look so youthful and hunky.
          [Snake voice]  The kid's gotta die.
          [Homer voice]  But I love my son.
          [Snake voice]  More than a lush head of hair?
          [Homer voice]  Don't make me choose!
          [laughs with Snake's laugh]
          [Homer voice]  No!
          [Homer tosses the hammer aside.  He grabs Snake's hair, and
          tears it from his head]
          [Homer voice]  I love you, son!
Bart:     I love you too, dad.  [they hug]
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Snake may be down, but he's not out.  His hair lunges onto Bart's
% face, trying to smother him.  Homer tries to subdue the hair by
% punching it, but that does more damage to the boy than to Snake.
% Chief Wiggum, accompanied by two officers, steps into the room and
% sees Homer throttling Bart.

Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for the murders of Moe Syzslak and
Apu Nahassa ... passa ... well, just Moe, just Moe.
-- Chief Wiggum, "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Homer tells Wiggum that it was really the hair that was behind the
% murders.  Since the hair was running around the room by itself, the
% story has a certain plausibility.  The police shoot it several times
% as it tries to leap out the window, until it finally falls limp.
% Maggie picks it up and uses it as a makeshift security blanket.

Wiggum:   Now that's what I call a bad hair day.
          [everyone but Marge laughs]
Marge:    May I remind you that two people are dead and ... oh, wait, I
          just got it.

% Bart and Lisa go on a strange journey to experience:
%
%                         Terror in Toon Town
%
% On the "Krusty the Klown Show," there is a flash of light and a cloud
% of smoke.  The haze drifts away to reveal -- an empty stage.  Krusty,
% dressed in a vampire costume, runs to fill the spot.

Krusty:   [Transylvanian accent] Hey, hey, tonight I'm going to suck!
          [cue card boy flips to next card]
          [normal voice]  Your blood.
          Okay, get ready for the violentest, disemboweling-est, vomit-
          inducingest "Itchy & Scratchy" Halloween special ever!
          [the screen goes dark]
Bart:     [simultaneous with Lisa] What the...?
Lisa:     Hey!
Marge:    Sorry, but if I let you watch some of these gruesome
          Halloween cartoons, I'd be a pretty lousy mother.
-- And if I *appeared* in one of those cartoons, well, "Treehouse of
          Horror"

% Marge asks the kids if they would like to join Maggie and her in
% trick-or-treating.  Bart declines, since that would interfere with the
% egg-throwing plans he has later that night.
%
% Homer walks by, sloppily dressed, and eating from a can.

Marge:    Oh, Homer you're not going as a hobo again?
Homer:    Going where?
-- Silly question, "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Marge goes out with Maggie, admonishing the kids to avoid "Itchy &
% Scratchy."  To be extra sure they obey her, she takes the batteries to
% the remote with her.  Homer, sitting in the kitchen with a harmonica,
% makes up a blues song on the spot.

Mama took those batteries,
Just took them away,
Mama took those batteries,
Size double-A!
-- Homer Simpson, "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% It doesn't take long before Bart has had enough.  He slams the
% kitchen door (!) shut, and rummages through Homer's toolbox.  He soon
% finds a short glowing green rod.

Lisa:     Oh, Bart, that's plutonium.  It's highly unstable!
Bart:     [forces the rod into the remote's battery slot with a hammer]
          Don't you ever get tired of being wrong?

% Bart turns on the TV.  A green ray comes from the remote and strikes
% the TV.  The feedback throws Bart back several feet onto the couch,
% and the TV itself glows and pulsates.  Nevertheless, Bart's idea works
% -- the kids can now watch "Candle in the Wound," the new I&S cartoon.
% Lisa wonders what why the TV acts strangely, and Bart figures the
% color is off.  He tries using the remote to adjust it, and adjust his
% and Lisa's color in the process.
%
% Bart and Lisa struggle over the remote.  Another ray arcs from the
% set, hits the kids, and transports them into the TV.  By the time they
% realize what happened, they are standing on the set of the "Itchy &
% Scratchy Show."

Bart:     Hey Lis, we're characters in a cartoon!
Lisa:     How humiliating.

% Itchy opens the door to Scratchy, who is trick or treating.  The
% mouse cuts off Scratchy's head.  Then he scoops out Scratchy's brains,
% and inserts a candle in their place to make a jack-o-lantern of his
% head.  The kids laugh heartily at this.

Scratchy:      Why are you laughing?
Itchy:         Hey!  They're laughing at your pain.
Scratchy:      [puts his head back on his body] That's mean.
Itchy:         Let's teach them a lesson.
               [Someone tosses an axe at Bart.  It parts his hair down
               the middle]
Bart:          A cartoon axe.  I love it.
               [laughs.  A trickle of blood runs down his forehead]
Bart + Lisa:   Aaah!
-- It's not just a cartoon, darn it, "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Itchy loads a cannon with all manner of deadly objects.  Bart and
% Lisa's eyes literally pop out of their sockets for a moment, and they
% run out of the house.  The cannon fires, and the kids have to duck to
% avoid the flying arsenal.
%
% Bart flags down a police car.  He and Lisa get in the back, and speed
% away from Itchy and Scratchy's place.  Lisa relaxes, but soon notices
% the police motto is, "To Protect and Sever."  Uh, oh -- this is Itchy
% and Scratchy's police car!  Itchy fires up a chainsaw and lunges at
% the kids, who dive to avoid the whirring blade.
%
% Back home, Homer notices his two oldest children are on TV.

Oooh, how are Bart and Lisa gonna get out of this one?
-- Homer Simpson, "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% While trying to slice and dice Bart and Lisa, Itchy accidentally lops
% off Scratchy's arms.  Scratchy takes the gaffe in stride, accepting
% Itchy's apology and steering the car with his teeth.
%
% Meanwhile Poochie skateboards down the street.  Those of you worrying
% that he might be making a comeback will no doubt be relieved to hear
% that I&S run him down.
%
% Inside the car, it looks like the end.  Bart has one more ace up his
% sleeve.  He draws an "eject" button on the seat of the car, and pushes
% it.  Bart and Lisa are catapulted high into the sky.  With the clouds
% rushing past, Bart reflects on their close escape.  Lisa is not so
% calm, though.  She nudges Bart to look at the ground, where Itchy and
% Scratchy (his arms now restored) lay out a pile of nasty-looking bear
% traps -- and then connect them to an electrical source.  The kids
% begin to fall to their doom.
%
% Meanwhile, back at the ranch ...

Marge:    It's probably nothing, but we just wanted to be sure.
Hibbert:  [goes to use the tongue depressor, but Maggie bites it into
          pieces]  Aah!
Homer:    Is there anything you can prescribe, doctor?
Hibbert:  Fire -- and lots of it!
Marge:    Oh, that's your cure for everything.
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Back at home, the family wonders what has become of their baby.  "If
% only you could tell us what's happening to you," Lisa muses.  She
% can't tell the Simpsons, but it turns out that Maggie can contact
% somebody.  Sucking extra-rapidly on her pacifier, she sends a signal
% that reaches a flying saucer travelling in deep space.  The signal
% lights a pacifier-shaped indicator aboard the spaceship.

Kodos:    Commander Kang, receiving transmission from infant pod
          thirteen.
Kang:     Holy flerking schnit!  What's the message?
Kodos:    Larval stage completed ... standing by for orders ...
          experiencing terrible rash.  Over.
Kang:     Ensign Kodos, set coordinates for the obscure T-shirt-
          producing planet known as, "Earth."  It's time I paid a visit
          to ... my daughter!
Kodos:    [overwhelmed]  Ohh ...
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Homer's viewing of "How Dracula Got His Groove Back" is interrupted
% by a knock at the door.

Homer:    [opens door to find Kang and Kodos standing there]
          Hello -- oh great.  Mormons.
Kang:     Actually, we're Quantum Presbyterians and we've come to see
          ... my daughter.  [holds up and squeaks a squeak-toy]
Marge:    Oh, Lord.  I was hoping this day would never come.
Homer:    Huh?  What are you talking about?
Kang:     You mean you never told him?
Marge:    Oh, I guess I've been in denial.  Homer, Kang is Maggie's
          father.
Homer:    [gasps]  You intergalactic hussy!  How could you!  [covers
          his face and cries]
          [looks up]  Was he better than me?
-- Well ..., "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Marge begins to retell the tale.  One day, she was having a great
% time hanging laundry in the back yard, when Kang's spacecraft hovered
% ominously in the air.  Using advanced alien devices (like a good
% length of rope), they bring Marge aboard the ship, and sit her on a
% couch.

Kang:     Congratulations.  You have been selected for our cross-
          breeding program.
Kodos:    To put you at ease, we have recreated the most common
          spawning locations of your species.  You may choose either
          [as Kodos lists the choices, he highlights a mock-up of each
          one]
          the back seat of a Camaro,
          an airplane bathroom,
          a friend's wedding,
          or the alley behind a porno theater.
Marge:    I absolutely refuse to go along with this; [pause] but since
          I have no choice, I'll take the alley.
          [the alley set slides behind the couch.  Kang retracts his
          helmet and sits next to Marge]
Kodos:    Initiate fertilization procedure.
Kang:     Oh, you look lovely this evening.  Have you decreased in
          mass?
Marge:    [voiceover]  I tried to resist, but they applied powerful
          mind-confusion techniques.
Kang:     Look behind you.
          [Marge looks, and Kang quickly uses a ray gun to beam
          something on her]
          Insemination complete.  [deploys space helmet]
Marge:    Really?  That seemed awfully quick.
Kang:     What are you implying?
Marge:    Nothing, nothing.
Kang:     Whoa, wow, look at the time.  I'd love to stay but I have an
          early meeting tomorrow.  You're a super girl, though.  I'll
          call you sometime.
          [pushes a button marked "dump."  The couch cushion tilts up,
          and Marge falls back to Earth through a chute]
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Nine months later, says Marge, Maggie was born.  Now, Kodos wants to
% take her back to Rigel 7, where she will be given lifetime employment
% in the Rigelian civil service.  Homer refuses to give Maggie up, and
% the two begin to fight.  Bart intercedes, saying, "there's only one
% man who can settle an argument this bizarre."
%
% That one way, of course, is to go on "The Jerry Springer Show."
% Today's topic is, "My Daddy's a Space Monster!"

Springer:      Okay, we're back.  Homer, how'd it feel to learn your
               baby was fathered by a drooling space octopus?
               [Graphic comes up that says, "Homer Simpson:  'Wife
               knocked boots with Space Stud!'"]
Homer:         It made me angry, Jerry.  Angry and tired.
Springer:      Well, you're about to get a whole lot angrier, because
               we have the extramarital extraterrestrial backstage in
               the soundproof booth where he can't hear us.
Kang:          I hear all!
Springer:      Ladies and gentlemen, meet Kang.
Kang:          [walks onstage, gives Marge a bouquet of roses, and
               kisses her hand.  Homer jumps and punches him]
Homer:         You lousy two-timing [bleep bleep]!  I'm gonna [bleep]!
Kang:          Oh yeah?  Well [bleep] hyperbolic parabaloid!  [bleep]
               yo mama!  [grabs two chairs and uses them to fight
               Homer]
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% Stagehands break up the fight.  Jerry takes the microphone into the
% audience to take questions.

Woman:         Yeah, I got a question for that gross thing, whatever it
               is.
Springer:      Homer.
Woman:         Nah, the green dude.  If you're that baby's daddy, where
               you been at?
               [audience voices its agreement]
               Ya know, someone needs to learn your green ass some
               responsibility.
               [audience cheers.  Kang pulls a ray gun and vaporizes
               the women]
Springer:      Now hold on, Kang.  You can't bully my audience with
               your fancy ray gun.
               [Kang vaporizes remainder of audience]
               And now for my final thought.
               [steps in front of his "final thought" backdrop]
               Nobody wins when parents put their petty squabbles above
               the welfare of a child.  Let's hope they put their
               differences aside, and do what's best for Maggie.
               [Maggie attacks Jerry]
               Ow!  What the [bleep]!  Get the [bleep] baby off
               [bleep]!  Son of a [bleep]!
               [Kang attacks Springer.  Homer attacks Kang again.  The
               show's end credit music comes up]
Marge:         I'm so [bleep] embarrassed.
-- A very special episode of "The Jerry Springer Show," "Treehouse of
   Horror"

% Kang, Kodos, and the Simpsons calmly gather outside the studio.

Marge:    I can't believe it.  Jerry Springer didn't solve our
          conflict.
Lisa:     And now he's dead.
Kang:     Anywho, this is your last chance.  Turn over the baby now.
Kodos:    Or we will destroy all your leaders in Washington.
Marge:    [knowingly] Oh, you couldn't destroy *every* politician.
Kang:     Just watch us.  [laughing menacingly, they board their flying
          saucer and take off]
Bart:     Don't forget Ken Starr!
Marge:    Suckers.
Homer:    C'mon, Maggie, let's go home.
Maggie:   Very well.  I'll drive!
          [laughs menacingly as the screen fades to black]
          I need blood.
-- "Treehouse of Horror IX"

% The Halloween credits roll.  Instead of the normal Gracie shush, we
% hear a quick sound bite of Regis Philbin yelling, "My eyes!  My
% Beautiful Eyes!"  (Or at least we did the second time the episode
% aired.  Technical snafus prevented this from happening the first time
% around.}

% [End of Act Three.  Time:  21:48]
