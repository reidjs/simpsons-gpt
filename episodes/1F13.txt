Homer's never been "worker of the week" - but isn't he the only person
other than Smithers to be "employee of the month" (in "Homer Defined")?
{ddg}

Homer's shadow doesn't quite match his profile.

Since when is carbon green?  {at}

OFF's position changes at the kitchen table.  {dh}

OFF shouldn't be eating dinner at the kitchen table.  {dh}

When Marge says that the whole family respects Homer, Maggie's plate
disappears, then reappears empty.  {tkc}

The parking meter is missing from in front of Moe's Tavern.  Did Moe
have it removed?  {dh}

Barney is sitting at the end of the bar, yet some scenes don't depict
this.  {dh}

Before Cape Canaveral was called Cape Kennedy, it was called Cape
Canaveral.  [not really a goof, but anyway - ed]

The microphone is missing from stand in the wide shot.  {dh}

Homer seems not to figure out that "Planet of the Apes" is actually
about the Earth until this episode.  Yet, in 8F10, when Marge asks him
if he's thought about the future, he asks, "You mean, when apes will
rule the earth?"  This might imply he'd already understood the ending of
"Planet of the Apes" before this episode.  {kh}

Homer's egg turner disappears.  {dh}

Barney's golf club appears to turn into two beer cans.  {dh}

Both the lung-test machines appear to be hooked up to the one monitor.
{dh}

When Homer's at the gas station, the moon is a crescent, but there's a
star right in the middle where the invisible part of the moon is.  {gp}

After Barney takes the champagne bottle, he holds it upside down for
several seconds, yet no champagne flows.  {md}

The champagne glasses disappear.  {dh}

Barney first holds the champagne bottle in his left hand, but changes
hands when he blasts off.  Later, he loses the champagne bottle.  {dh}

Homer's arm stretches during the struggle.  {jp}

Another hatch replaces the blown one in I&S cartoon.  {dh}

Banyon asked permission to "sedate cargo ahead of schedule" - he never
did "sedate cargo", on schedule or otherwise.  {ddg}

One of the astronauts appears to change his helmet.  {dh}

Floating potato chips aren't seen when Homer crashes into the ant farm.
{dh}

The gravity on the shuttle is inconsistent.  While they're in their ant
farm, the ants are standing on the ground, as if there were gravity.
Similarly, when the ants short out the controls, Race and Buzz run back
and forth on the floor, while Homer runs on the ceiling, as if both had
gravity.  {at}

You can't create a total vacuum outside of a house, at least not without
destroying the house.  {ddg}

SLH and SBII join the family for one scene.  {dh}

In some later scenes the ant farm isn't smashed.  {dh}

When the hatch is blown open, Homer isn't not wearing his seat harness;
nobody is strong enough to prevent being pulled out by the force simply
by "holding onto something".  Also, when Homer is holding onto the
handle, chips are still being "forced" out of the shuttle, but neither
of the other two astronauts are affected.  {ddg}

In one scene, the shuttle hatch appears to be the wrong scale.  {dh}

The inside of the shuttle shouldn't get hot on re-entry.  {ddg}

The only way they could survive the sudden stop caused by a nose-first
landing into a building is with VERY large air bags.  {ddg}

In space the rod jamming the hatch appears to come out easily once the
shuttle is back on earth.  {dh}

Homer's hand made the cover of TIME, yet his spacesuit glove isn't on in
the photo.  {ddg}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Samuel Walch: IMHO, the best episode this season!  The Malibu Stacey
    episode had some great social satire, but when it comes to all out
    laughs, Deep Space Home takes the cake (or floor pie).  Up to this
    point, I've been worried that the show had run out of gas, but the
    last two episodes have restored my faith.

Tom Celentano: Last night's episode was hysterical.  The barbs at the
    news media were especially funny and right on target.  As a long
    time space buff, I loved the space humor.  The takeoffs of Home
    Improvement and Married With Children were perfect.

John J. Wood: Yow!  Two weeks in a row, The Simpsons produce another
    hilarious outing!  Like James Cherry said: choice gags, an
    interesting plot, the pre-beer Barney, and the 2001- Homer-chows-
    potato-chips gag (another classic Homer bit).  Interestingly enough,
    I've found that many of my favorite Simpsons episodes have had
    "Homer" involved in its title (Homer The Heretic, for example): this
    one's a keeper.  My grade: A!

Don Del Grande: (B+) A very good episode overall, but it lacked that one
    standout item that would have made it "excellent".  The bit about
    the "giant ants" was overdone a little, and the animators could have
    made the shuttle look a little more like the real thing.

Jeff Briskin: IMHO, this was the best episode (maybe second to "Homer 'n
    Mindy") of the season so far.  The writing, pacing, even the
    references were sharp as nails.  [...] After the nadir of "Bart Gets
    Famous," OFF has rebounded with a bang over the last few episodes.

Carl Frank: The plot was a trifle slow to develop and the big theme
    (Homer needs respect) was never really tied together.  Moreover, the
    SF references were rather easy and slight (Right Stuff, Apes, ST and
    ST-TNG, and Alien).  And the carbon rod was too much of a gimmick.
    Rating A-.

Andrew Ross: I give the episode a B, not because it was below par, but
    because there were too many space movie references that went right
    by me.

Ron Carter: [ B ] Awfully good, but not great.  The pacing gets thrown
    off at odd times, and usually by the guest appearances.  Homer as a
    "2001" icon was super as always, but the awkward moments were a
    downer.

Matthew Kurth: "Deep Space Homer" was decidedly average.  I thought the
    dialogue was uninspiring, and more expositional than usual.  In
    fact, for the the first act the lines seemed a little forced and
    uncharacteristic.  The references were superb, but there was no
    punch to the script.  [...] 5 of 10.

Yours truly: Awright!  A giant leap for the Simpsons over 1F12, "Lisa
    vs. Malibu Stacy".  Packed with choice lines, references everywhere,
    previous episode gags.  Barney reverts to the smart, pre-beer Barney
    first seen in 9F07.  I give it an A-.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Homer and Tang

Bill Lapworth notes, "Homer is on the phone to NASA and talks about
    Tang, among other things.  Next we see him talking to the President
    (and I don't have the exact quote) because the Pres. knows Tang.
    The way my twisted mind works, they were alluding to 'tang, as in
    poon tang, as in Gennifer Flowers, et. al."

>> Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle

Scott Renshaw says Arbuckle was a silent film comedian who "was
    blackballed from the film industry after a scandal in which he was
    accused of inadvertently killing a young woman during particularly
    rough intercourse."  Kurt Eppley adds, "Though Mr. Arbuckle was
    acquitted of killing his friend (one Virginia Rappe), he suffered
    irreparable harm to his career due to the persistent rumor that he
    had violated and ruptured the young lady using a wine bottle."

>> Minneapolis Star

Tony Hill says, "The Star folded in April 1982.  The Tribune was the
    renamed the Minneapolis Star and Tribune, but even a child could
    tell it was 90% Tribune, 10% Star.  In 1987, the paper was renamed
    StarTribune: Newspaper of the Twin Cities (an appellation for this
    area which I never EVER use!), with separate Minneapolis, St. Paul,
    and outstate editions.  [...] On the day the Star published its last
    issue, I called the paper and asked where the answer to the
    crossword puzzle would appear."

>> "Corvair" as the shuttle's name

Tom Long says, "The Chevrolet Corvair (automobile) was the subject of
    Ralph Nader's book/expose' of the auto industry in the sixties --
    `Unsafe At Any Speed.'  Corvairs, as I recall, just were plain old
    accident prone cars, and they were eventually discontinued as the
    publicity got real bad.  So, it seems to me that the name of the
    ship in the 2/24 episode was a reference to the shoddiness, etc.,
    and dangerousness of the ship, in the general sarcastic Simpsons
    manner."

>> Homer as an Ape: the gags continue

Here is a list of episodes with Homer being compared to an ape in them:

    - [7G01] "Simpsons, what a bunch of savages.  Especially that big
      ape father."
    - [7G02] Bart calls Homer a "KWYJIBO" (a balding ape)
    - [7G09] Homer is mistaken for Bigfoot
    - [7G10] Burns calls Homer an "over-sexed orangutan in heat"
    - [7F02] uses 'Gorilla Man' hair tonic
    - [7F05] Bart calls him one sad, ape-like dude
    - [7F08] Homer can't make the shot at the Ape hole
    - [7F10] Burns wants to buy off Homer with a banana or two.
    - [7F19] Lisa to Homer: "You, sir, are a baboon!"
    - [8F06] Opening scene with 2001
    - [8F18] Marge calls Homer a big ape
    - [8F22] Homer hoots like an ape
    - [9F04] "King Homer" sketch
    - [1F01] "Planet of the Apes" with Homers pulling the carts
    - [1F13] Homer looks like an ape walking through the X-ray machine

   Burns: Compadres, it is imperative that we crush the freedom fighters
          before the start of the rainy season.  And remember, a shiny
          new donkey for whoever brings me the head of Colonel Montoya.
           [Smithers whispers to him]
          Hmm?  What?  Oh, and by that I mean, of course, it's time for
          the "Worker of the Week Award".  I can't believe we've

  Man: You stupid -- [laughs uncontrollably]
Homer: D'oh!  [switches channels]

% The channel Homer happened to flick to shows two men talking about the
% impending launch of the space shuttle.

  Tom: It's a lovely day for a launch, here, live at Cape Canaveral, at
       the lower end of the Florida Peninsula, and the purpose of
       today's mission is truly, really electrifying.
Man 2: That's correct, Tom.  The lion's share of this flight will be
       devoted to the study of the effects of weightlessness on tiny
       screws.
  Tom: Unbelievable, and just imagine the logistics of weightlessness.
       And of course, this could have literally millions of applications
       here on Earth -- everything from watchmaking to watch repair.
Homer: Boring.
        [tries to switch channels, but the batteries fall from the
       remote control]
       No!  The batteries!
  Tom: Now let's look at the crew a little.
Man 2: They're a colorful bunch.  They've been dubbed "the Three
       Musketeers".  Heh heh heh --
  Tom: And we laugh legitimately.  There's a mathematician, a different
       _kind_ of mathematician, and a statistician.
Homer: Make it stop!  [panics]
 Bart: Oh no, not another boring space launch.  Change the channel.

    Homer: Hello, is this President Clinton?  Good!  I figured if anyone
           knew where to get some Tang, it'd be you.  ...Shut up!
Assistant: Excuse me --
    Homer: Aah!
Assistant: Are you the person that called NASA yesterday?
    Homer: No, it wasn't me, I swear!  It was...him!  [points to Barney]
Scientist: Sir, how would you like to get higher than you've ever been
           in your life?
   Barney: Be an astronaut?  Sure!
Scientist: Well, welcome aboard.  I think you'll find this will win you
           the respect of your family and friends.
    Homer: [gasps] Respect?  Nooo!  It was me.  _I_ made the crank call.
           I do it all the time!  Check with the FBI: I have a file.  I
           have a file!
Scientist: Ehh, better take both of them.
            [The assistant clubs Barney and Homer, knocking them out]
           I don't really think that was necessary; they _wanted_ to be
           astronauts.
Assistant: I know.

% Another reporter decides to grill Homer.

 Reporter: Uh, question for the barbeque chef.  Don't you think there is
           an inherent danger in sending underqualified civilians into
           space?
    Homer: I'll field this one.  The only danger is if they send us to

Scientist: Now of course only one of you will be chosen to go into
           space.  So the next few weeks will be a grueling series of

Assistant: Oh, and Mr. Gumble: for the duration of the training there
           will be no more beer.
   Barney: What?  Three whole weeks with only wine?  I'll go crazy!
    Homer: And may the best man win.  [whispers to assistant] He's got a

Marge: Pride?
 Bart: No, not _that_ far from shame.
Homer: [quavering] Less shame?
 Bart: [happy] Yeah...
-- English has a word for everything, "Deep Space Homer"

Marge: You know, Homer, when I found out about this, I went through a
       wide range of emotions.  First I was nervous, then anxious, then
       wary, then apprehensive, then...kind of sleepy, then worried, and
       then concerned, but now I realize that being a spaceman is

     Buzz: {Second comes right after first.

    Homer: [contemptuous] I, er, don't think this contest is over yet,
           "Buzz"...if that _is_ your real name.  I believe there is
           still a little something called "The Swimsuit Competition".
Scientist: There's no swimsuit competition, Homer.

% At last, the big day arrives.  Barney does somersaults while holding
% onto some gymnast's rings as Homer stands there.  The scientist and
% his assistant approach, and Barney does a perfect dismount.

Scientist: Gentlemen, you've both worked very hard.  And in a way,
           you're both winners.  But in another more accurate way,
           Barney is the winner.
    Homer: [downcast] Congratulations, Barney.
Scientist: That's very gracious of you, Homer.  Please join us in a
           toast...to the mission!

% lands in the middle of the road, only to be run over by a marshmallow

% The Itchy and Scratchy cartoon is a topical one: "Scar Trek: The Next
% Laceration".  Scratchy pilots a spaceship, eating a baloney sandwich
% and licking his fingers as he swallows it whole.  But his stomach
% starts to bulge out, and he screams as Itchy breaks through, holding
% the undigested sandwich.  Out of spite, Itchy eats the sandwich
% himself and tosses the cat in the airlock, pressing the button to blow
% him into space.  Luckily, Scratchy is prepared, and he snaps his space
% suit helmet on just as he is ejected.
%
% Floating free in space doesn't save him, however.  Itchy goes out in a
% space pod with arms and giggles, grabbing Scratchy's body.  He carries
% the body up to the rings of a nearby planet and saws the unfortunate
% cat in half.  Scratchy chases after his lower half, but it burns up as
% it enters the planet's atmosphere.  He shrugs, but Itchy flies up to
% him, grabs his torso, and removes his helmet.  His head enlarges in
% the vacuum, and Itchy bursts it with a pin.  "THE END" appears on the

% He loses his nerve and calls Marge.

Homer: Marge...I don't really want to go through with this.  But being
       an astronaut is how I got you to respect me!
Marge: Homer, when I met you, you weren't an astronaut.  You didn't even
       know how to use a touchtone, but I _still_ respected you and I
       always will, no matter what.
        [touchtone sounds come from the phone]
       Homer, you already dialed.
-- I can't believe they invented it, "Deep Space Homer"

Marge: But on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an
       opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your
       life.
Homer: You're right, Marge.  Just like the time I could have met Mr. T
       at the mall.  The entire day I kept saying, "I'll go a little
       later.  I'll go a little later."  And then when I got there, they
       told me he'd just left.  And when I asked the mall guy if he
       would ever come back again, he said he didn't know.  Well, I'm
       never going to let something like that happen again!  I'm going
       into space right now!
Marge: Oh, I am so proud of you.  And I know it's going to go just fine

% Buzz warns him, "Homer, no!"  But it's too late: Homer opens the bag
% nonetheless.  The chips float about the cabin, and Race rues, "They'll
% clog the instruments!"  Buzz is worried: "Careful!  They're ruffled."
% Homer has the solution, however; he unbuckles his seat belt, and
% accompanied by "The Blue Danube Waltz", he floats about the cabin,

% colony.

Ant 1: Protect the queen!
Ant 2: Which one's the queen?
Ant 3: I'm the queen!
Ant 1: No you're not!
Homer: Nooo!  [his head smashed the colony, and the ants float free]

            to Mission Control to wish you well and play you a little
            bit of his own brand of laid-back adult contemporary music.
     Homer: Wow, former president James Taylor.
    Taylor: How ya doin', fellas?
      Buzz: With all due respect, Mr. Taylor, this isn't the best time
            for your unique brand of bittersweet folk rock.  We have a
            potentially critical situation here.  I'm sure you'll
            understand.
    Taylor: Listen, Aldrin, I'm not as laid back as people think.  Now
            here's the deal: I'm going to play, and you're going to
            float there and like it.

% Kent Brockman reports on Channel Six.

    Kent: We're just about to get our first pictures from inside the
          spacecraft with "average-naut" Homer Simpson, and we'd like to
          -- aah!
           [Camera shows a close-up of an ant floating in front of the
          three astronauts]
Everyone: Aah!
    Kent: Ladies and gentlemen, er, we've just lost the picture, but,
          uh, what we've seen speaks for itself.  The Corvair spacecraft
          has been taken over -- "conquered", if you will -- by a master
          race of giant space ants.  It's difficult to tell from this
          vantage point whether they will consume the captive earth men
          or merely enslave them.  One thing is for certain, there is no
          stopping them; the ants will soon be here.
          And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords.  I'd like to
          remind them that as a trusted TV personality, I can be helpful
          in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar
          caves.
   Marge: Mmm, don't worry, kids.  I'm sure your father's all right.

            [the astronauts smack back and forth into the walls]
   Taylor: Ants, huh?  We had quite a severe ant problem at the vineyard
           this year.  I had Art Garfunkel come by with his compressor,
           and we created a total vacuum outside the house, and we blew
           the ants out the front door.  But I'm sure you high-tech NASA

% Race and Buzz prepare the shuttle to be evacuated of air.  Buzz pushes
% the button with a "Make hatch blow now!"  The ants and chips get

% Homer hangs outside the shuttle still, and the handle finally gives in
% and snaps off.  Fortunately, Buzz and Race are there to grab him.

 Buzz: Homer, you broke the handle.
 Race: With that hatch open, we'll burn up on re-entry!  That's it: if I
       go, I'm taking you to hell with me.
Homer: Wait a minute, Race.  Wait a minute...wait!
        [breaks off a support rod]
       Aha!  Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours!
        [tries to swing it, but it catches in the door]
       Aw, stupid bar.
 Buzz: Wait, Homer.  If that bar holds, we just might make it back to
       earth.
Homer: Oh.  [voice rising] I'll bash you good!
-- One-track minds, "Deep Space Homer"

Well, this reporter was...possibly a little hasty earlier and would like
to...reaffirm his allegiance to this country and its human president.
May not be perfect, but it's still the best government we have.  For
now.
 [notices "HAIL ANTS" sign taped up, tears it down]
Oh, yes, by the way, the spacecraft still in extreme danger, may not

 Abe: Aw, of course he'll make it.  It's TV.

     Tom: Uh, how'd you solve the door dilemma?
    Buzz: Homer Simpson was the real hero here.  He jury-rigged the door

 Bart: Aw, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod!
Homer: Oh, stupid rod!  I got gypped.
Marge: Oh, Homey, you should be proud!  Only a handful of people have
