        fire extinguisher and a box of "extra coarse" toilet paper?

Don Del Grande:
    ... SNPP has pay toilets?
    ... one of the machines Homer slides by is the "Try New Crystal Buzz

    ... there are women at SNPP doing calisthenics?
    ... the only reason the ladder over the tank exists is to reach the
        shutoff switch?
    ... the "tank manual shutdown" is a simple switch, yet the computer
        couldn't do it by just asking Homer "Do you want to shut down
        the tank?"?

    ... Homer's computer had two external disk drives, instead of the
        internally mounted kind?
    ... the input method on Homer's computer is kind of weird?  (If you
        enter "Y-E-S" quickly, the program accepts this as "YES."
        however, if you just enter "Y," you have to pause for a few
        seconds for the machine to accept your input.)

Eliot Williams:
    ... Smithers covers Homer's shoulder with a cloth before Burns leans
        on it during the remote terminal dedication?
    ... Homer uses a regular QWERTY keyboard...even though he only has
        four fingers?

Jose Lafaurie:
    ... Mr. Burns is unusually strong in this episode?

    ... the man on the "MEN" sign appears to have a hardhat on?
    ... Homer is actually standing in the toilet bowl?

        fatter Homer?

        eating any?

Tony Hill:
    ... Homer takes off his pants but not his shoes?
    ... Dr. Nick classifies Homer as "dangerously underweight"?

The "Crystal Buzz Cola" machine has a picture of a glass filled with a
non-clear beverage.  {ddg}

The bookcase on the left wall of Burns' office shouldn't be there: his
video monitors should.  Plus, the bookcase disappears after Burns sends
Homer on his way.  {rl}

The oil streak Homer leaves on the rug in Burns' office is gone when
Burns pushes him away.  {ddg}

How does Lisa swivel herself on the pillow chair without touching the
ground?  {dd}

When Maggie makes her Play-Doh donut, there is no red or white in it,
but the Play-Doh Homer eats has both red and white in it.  {ddg}

Homer's bathroom scale should register a higher weight as soon as he
holds the Play-Doh, but it waits until he eats it.  {dd}

Marge's lipstick disappears.  {rl}

The clothes on the rack behind Homer at "The Vast Waistband" change from
suits to shirts.  {dh}

Unless Homer needed them, the keyboard caps were absent in the first
shots.  {rl}

When Homer looks at PgUp on the non-numeral keypad, only PgUp and PgDn
are there; the rest are not capped.  {rl}

In the closeup of Homer pressing the "Y" key, the "Y" is much thinner
than the other characters.  {dh}

If every computer question requires a response of "Y", why even bother
asking a human operator?  Shouldn't the computer just go ahead and do
it?  {ddg}

Homer reads the "Utne Reader" subscription reminder like a postcard, but
it appears to have an envelope flap.  {jm}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Joe Manfre: A funny episode but somewhat shallow...these Homer episodes
    are getting more and more repetitive as time goes on.  I was
    disappointed that the writers went *nowhere* with the "Homer as
    overweight crusader" idea.  At least the gags in this one were a
    part of, and not extraneous to, the *plot*.  Grade: B.

Mark Richey: While it is entirely believable that Homer would be lazy
    enough to gain 61 pounds just to avoid work, that probably would
    have made a better second story, rather than the focus of the entire
    episode.  As it stands, it's an average episode, ranking as a C.

Adam Lipkin: Um...What the hell was that?  This episode was barely
    funny.  Sure, there were some good parts, like Ralph's line, and Dr.
    Nick, and the reappearance of the drinking bird, but most of the
    rest was just low-quality.  C.

Dale Abersold: This episode was very enjoyable, mostly because it was
    _funny_, and there was no attempt at moralizing or maudlin
    sentimentality.  Best moment: the beginning, when Homer is dragged
    off to the horror of...calisthenics.  Grade: A. Best episode since
    "Sideshow Bob Roberts".

Haynes Lee: Review: B-.  Way too heavy on the fat humor but the computer
    humor was near non-existent.  It would have been nice to see Homer
    join the ranks of the nerds.

Scott Fujimoto: OK, this was mostly a gag episode, but I still found it
    pretty funny.  The best part was when Homer was desparately trying
    to gain his 62 pounds.  Mmmm...Play Doh.  Grade: B.

Don Del Grande: B-minus -- it was going along relatively well during the
    first two-thirds of the show, but the "get to the plant before it
    blows up" bit didn't seem very funny.  There just aren't that many
    "fat jokes" to work with in the first place.  This is definitely a
    story that needed a subplot.

Ricardo Lafaurie: A strong showing.  Once again, the writers prove they
    can do well without references.  And the brief computer footage was
    great too.  That Play-Doh had to be one of the sickest things Homer
    ever ate.  Grade: B-.

Benjamin Robinson: "King-Size Homer" is at least regular-size fun.  Good
    jokes and (mostly) good characterizations mark this episode.  I'd
    say it's a fine first "Simpsons" effort by Dan Greaney.  (B+)

Dominik Halas: Although this episode didn't have me ROTFL, it didn't
    have me cringing in disbelief, either.  The fact that there was only
    one plot line allowed them to develop the plot more than usual.
    Altogether, a solid but not outstanding episode.  Grade: B.

Tony Hill: This was an OK episode, not very outstanding by OFF's usual
    high standards.  Did they _really_ make fun of FDR's disability?  It
    was better social commentary on the way people are granted
    disability freely, IMHO.  The animation of the fat Homer was not all
    that pleasant to look at.  C-.

Yours truly: Not terribly funny.  It was pretty much a one-joke episode,
    and not a terribly plausible one at that.  I couldn't quite accept
    Burns leading an exercise class, and Homer looked to be much larger
    than 300 pounds, if he's 239 in his regular frame.  Grade: C-.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Real-life fat guys

Haynes Lee notes, "The two fat guys on the motorcycles in the Vast
    Waistband shop are Benny and Billy McCrary, who hold the Guiness
    World Record(tm) of the heaviest twins at 1,500 pounds."  Dominik
    Halas notes the presence of these two plus a third mannequin and
    says, "They are actually models of the world's heaviest man (Jon
    Bower Minnoch, weighed 975 lb) and the world's heaviest twins (Benny
    and Billy McCrary, weighed 723 lb and 743 lb, respectively.)
    Although I can't be sure about Minnoch, the twins are drawn almost
    exactly as they appear in their photo in the Guinness Book of World
    Records."
    
    As well, Bart imagines himself as a real fat guy from the news a few
    years ago.  He too used a sponge to clean himself.

>> Closed captioning note

Both Ricardo Lafaurie and I noticed that when the man says, "Paul
    Newman's going to break my legs," the captioning said "Jolly Time"
    instead of "Paul Newman".  This isn't the first time something has
    been overdubbed at the last minute -- recall Bart's "Just ask Claus
    von Bulow" in 1F19, which sounds different than his immediately
    preceding line.

>> "Press any key"

Benjamin Robinson says, "Before you laugh at Homer, consider this: The
    Compaq help desk reports that one of the most frequent new-user
    questions is, `Where's the "Any" key?'  The folks at Compaq fielded
    this one so often that they eventually gave up and changed all their
    documentation to read, `Press the ENTER key.'"

>> Chernobyl & Three-Mile Island

Ricardo Lafaurie explains that these are "two nuclear accidents.
    Chernobyl was a plant in Russia that nearly suffered a meltdown, and
    nuclear waste flew into the air, poisoning cows in the field and
    thus poisoning the milk.  Oh, it was horrible...if you lived in
    Russia.  Three-Mile Island, on the other hand, didn't explode, but
    it contaminated the island."

>> Homer's flashing

Jussi Pakkanen noticed two single frames of Homer's nakedness being
    revealed under his muumuu as he falls into the tank.  He writes, "It
    is a sort of an inside joke for animators to include single frames
    of nudity in their work.  Until the recent years these frames were
    impossible to detect, but nowadays they are fairly simple to see
    thanks to frame-by-frame videos and laser discs.  The Simpsons crew
    was brave enough to show that Homer has no underwear under his
    muumuu, but they weren't bold enough to `reveal everything'."

Lenny: Actually Homer, that's just one.  See, each pushup includes both
       an up part and a down part.
Homer: D'oh!  Hey, where's Charlie?  How'd he get out of this?
 Carl: Uh, he's at home on disability.
Lenny: Yeah, he got injured on the job and they sent him home with pay.

 Bart: If you gain 61 pounds they'll let you work at home?
Homer: Y'uh huh, that's the deal.  No more exercise program, no more
       traffic, no more blood drives or charity walks.
 Bart: Dad, I know we don't do a lot together but helping you gain 61
       pounds is something I want to be a part of.

 Lisa: Dad!
Homer: [frightened] Aah!
 Lisa: I must protest.  You're abusing a program intended to help the
       unfortunate.
Homer: Hee hee hee, I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey, but try to
       see it my way: all my life I've been an obese man trapped inside
       a fat man's body.
 Lisa: Have you told Mom about this?
Homer: No, it would only worry her.  If you want to add to her worries,
       go ahead.  I guess _I'm_ just a little more grateful for all the
       things she's done for us.

    Hibbert: [turns around again] Yes.
-- And that doctor is..., "King-Size Homer"

% Dr. Nick Riviera walks into the room.

  Dr. Nick: Hi everybody!
Homer+Bart: Hi Doctor Nick!
      Nick: Now there are many options available for dangerously
            underweighted individuals like yourself.  I recommend a slow
            steady gorging process combined with assal horizontology.
     Homer: [pensive] Of course.
      Nick: [points to a chart] You'll want to focus on the neglected
            food groups such as the whipped group, the congealed group
            and the chocotastic!
     Homer: What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?
      Nick: Well...be creative.  Instead of making sandwiches with
            bread, use poptarts.  Instead of chewing gum, chew bacon,
            heh...
      Bart: You could brush your teeth with milkshakes!
  Dr. Nick: Hey, did you go to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College too?
            And remember, if you're not sure about something, rub it
            against a piece of paper.  If the paper turns clear, it's

Marge: [getting thrown on top of Homer] Whoa!
Homer: Oh!  Hello, honey.
Marge: Hi.  Erm, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.  Did
       you put on a little weight this week?
Homer: I was going to surprise you, but what the heck: honey, I'm
       purposely gaining 61 pounds to get on disability!
Marge: [gasps] Have you lost your mind?  Have you thought about your
       health...or your appearance?
Homer: Oh.  So that's it, isn't it, Marge?  Looks.  I didn't know you
       were so shallow.
Marge: Oh, please.  I would love you if you weighed 1000 pounds, but --

Homer: Oh, I've got 15 minutes to gain a pound or I have to face another
       day at work!
 Bart: Bad news, Dad.  We're out of food.  We're even out of the basic
       elements of food.  You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the
       soy sauce.
Homer: I need a miracle.  [Maggie squeezes off some Play-Doh and shapes
       it into a donut, handing it to Homer.]
Homer: Aw, honey, that looks just like a real donut.
 Bart: [goading] Dad...its says its non-toxic.
Homer: [eating it] Well, that's a plus.

Smithers: Simpson, Sir.  One of your chair moisteners from Sector 7G.

   Homer: I'm looking for something loose and billowy, something

Salesman: Work, huh?  Let me guess.  Computer programmer, computer
          magazine columnist, something with computers?
   Homer: Well, I use a computer.
Salesman: [quietly, to self] Yeah, what's the connection?  Must be the

Arnie: Arnie Pie in the sky with the morning commute.  Traffic this
       morning is as bad as it gets.  Due to a fire at the Army testing
       lab, a bunch of escaped infected monkeys are roaming the
       expressway.  Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your
       windows, 'cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable.
Homer: Hee hee hee.  I pity those poor suckers on the freeway.  Gas
       break honk.  Gas break honk.  Honk honk punch.  Gas gas gas.
        [Walks to terminal.]
       8:58, first time I've ever been early for work.  Except for all

 Homer: [reading screen] "To Start Press Any Key".  Where's the ANY key?
        I see Esk ["ESC"], Catarl ["CTRL"], and Pig-Up ["PGUP"].  There
        doesn't seem to be any ANY key.  Woo!  All this computer hacking
        is making me thirsty.  I think I'll order a TAB.  [presses TAB

Farmer: Oh, no!  The corn.  Paul Newman's gonna have my legs broke.

% Cut back to living room.  Bart and Lisa get ready to leave for school.

Homer: [taunting] Bart and Lisa have to go to school, while I get to
       stay at home, naah naah nah naah naah.
 Lisa: I like school.
Homer: Well, why don't you live at it, then?
 Lisa: [drolly] I would if I could.
 Bart: Not me, sister.  When I grow up I want to be a lardo on workman's
       comp, just like Dad.
        [Imagines an older, superfat Bart lying on a bed with media
       people all around him.]

-- Love those sponge baths, "King-Size Homer"

 Lisa: Ew!  Mom, this whole thing is really creepy.  Are you sure you
       won't talk to Dad?
Marge: Mmm, I'd like to, honey, but I'm not sure how.  Your father can
       be surprisingly sensitive.  {Remember when I giggled at his
       Sherlock Holmes hat?  He sulked for a week and then closed his
       detective agency.}
 Lisa: Well, maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings.  The longer he
       lives likes this, the harder it'll be to go back.
Marge: [realizes] You're right.  Maybe if I use my least nagging tone of
       voice...[tries]
       Homer?  [tries again]
       Homer!  [tries again]
       Homer...that's it.  That's the one.  All right, send him on in.

Marge: Homer, we need to have a serious talk.
Homer: You dragged me all the way from work for that?
Marge: Let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your
       controversial plan, shall we?
Homer: I --
Marge: Con!  You're endangering your health.
Homer: Pro: I'm drought-and famine-resistant.
Marge: Con!  You're setting a bad example for the children.
Homer: Pro: I, er, don't have to go to work.
Marge: Con!  You're running the air conditioner non-stop.  It's freezing
       in here.
Homer: Pro.  Uh...uh..  I love you?
Marge: Con: I'm finding myself less attracted to you physically.
Homer: Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of right here and
       nobody's gonna take it away from me.  You never had faith in me
       before, but let me tell you, the slim lazy Homer you knew is
       dead.  Now I'm a big fat dynamo!  And where's that cake?
Marge: There's no cake.

       There, you found the floor.
  SLH: Arf!

Marge: I'm going out, I run errands during the day.
Homer: Could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer?

    Bart: He's a nuclear safety technician.
  Nelson: What's he doing with that broom?
    Bart: [sheepish] Uh...what isn't he doing?
   Jimbo: I heard that guy's ass has its own congressman.
           [laughs, gives Nelson a high five]
    Lisa: Hey, leave my dad alone.  Just because he's overweight doesn't
          mean he's bad: he's a sweet man and he has real feelings.
   Homer: [inside] Hey, what are you kids looking at?
Milhouse: Hey, look he's trying to get up and yell at us!
   Homer: Don't make me close that shade!

 Bart: Hey, Homer, you promised Mom you wouldn't wear your dress
       outside.
Homer: Nuts to that.  I'm going to the movies.
 Lisa: Shouldn't you be working?
Homer: I've got someone to cover for me.

% Homer goes off to "Honk If You're Horny!" starring Faye Dunaway and

    Homer: One for "Honk", please.
Ticketeer: Oh.  Gee, uh, just a minute.  I have to check with the
           manager.
            [to manager] That overweight guy wants to see the movie.
  Manager: I'm terribly sorry, sir, but I'm afraid our facilities are
           not equipped to meet your needs.
    Homer: What are you talking about?
  Manager: What I'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage couldn't
           possibly fit in our seats.
    Homer: I can sit in the aisle.
  Manager: I'm afraid that would violate the fire code.
Bystander: Hey, Fatty!  I've got a movie for ya: "A Fridge Too Far"!
           [HA]
-- Low fat-jokes, "King-Size Homer"

% The rapidly-assembling crowd laughs.

  Homer: Shame on all of you.  Give me my dignity!  I just came here to
         see "Honk If You're Horny" in peace.
Manager: Sir, if you'd just quiet down, I'd be happy to treat you to a
         garbage bag full of popcorn.
  Homer: This may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food.  I'm
         sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes!  The overweight
         individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and
         hard working as everybody else.  And they're going to make
         their voices heard!  All they need is a leader.
          [doffs his cape and struts off]
         Hmph...I'll work harder than ever before and show the world
         that overweight people are not undisciplined, lazy and

Ralph: I heard your dad went into a restaurant and ate everything in the

 Lisa: I think it's ironic that Dad saved the day while a slimmer man

Marge: Bart!
