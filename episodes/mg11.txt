> Quotes and scene summary
===============================================================================
% B = Bart, H = Homer
%
% {Curly braces} enclose dialogue or scenes cut in syndication.
%
% Homer is in traditional fishing attire.  Floppy hat.  A styrofoam cooler
% in his arms.  Fishing pole balanced atop the cooler.  Orange life jacket
% on his shoulders.  (Okay, maybe the life jacket isn't traditional...)

H: I can almost taste that trout already!

% Pull back.  Homer has reached the riverbank.  Behind him, Bart drags
% a red rowboat.  Bart is facing away from Homer, the upside-down
% boat covering his head, panting heavily.

B: Where are we?
H: Cut the chatter, boy.  Get the boat in the water.

% Close-up on Bart, as he falls backwards.

B: Ugh!   (*splash*)  Oof!

% The boat (with Bart in it) drifts away.

B: [waving his arms]  Whoa, I'm adrift!  I'm adrift!

% Homer dives in, swims to the boat, and lifts himself in.
% (The boat lists in the obvious direction.)

B: Boy, for a second there I thought I was up a creek without a paddle.

% Homer just sits, panting and staring.

B: Dad?

% More panting and staring.

B: Dad?

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:22]
%
% While Bart rows, Homer reclines, enjoying a can of what we presume to
% be that wonderful Duff.

H: Fetch me a bologna sandwich, there, boy!

% Bart opens the cooler.

B: Uh oh.
H: [angrily] Don't tell me you forgot to bring the bologna sandwiches!

% Bart sifts through the contents of the cooler.

H: [quietly angry] I want my bologna sandwich now!

% Bart has found a jar labelled ``Bait''.  He empties the worms onto a piece
% of white bread and hands the sandwich to Homer.

B: Here you go, sir.

% Homer takes the sandwich.

H: What are you staring at?  Go on, have a sandwich yourself.
B: Uh, I'm not hungry.
H: (*chomp*) Mmm!  Good!
B: Whew!

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:46]
%
% Homer inspects the empty jar of bait.

H: {Hmm.  I} coulda sworn we brought more worms.

% Bart smiles nervously.

H: Hey!
B: What?
H: [in a panic] Rapids!
B: [freaks out] Nnnnngh!

% Top view of the rowboat as it wanders through a rock garden, like a
% bad video game.  Homer waves his arms wildly.

H: Don't panic!  ... Just keep calm, and we'll zip right through 'em. ...
   Oh, no!  ... Ooooh! ... Ooh!  ...  Help!
B: Ugugugugugugug...
H: Rogogogogogogogogogocks!

% A montage of various shots of Homer and Bart (and the rocks), sort of
% like a cheap ride at Disneyland.
%
% They've reached a calm spot in the river.  Homer is flat on his back.
% Bart is bleary-eyed.

B: [eyes gone bonkers] That was mildly enjoyable, sir.

% Homer tries to raise his head to respond, then collapses.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 1:08]
%
% Homer reclines, fishing.  Bart rows.  Homer is missing his right shoe.

H: Sing that little ditty you were singing before, boy.
   It calms my nerves.

B: [singing] Row, row, row your boat...
H: That's the tune!
B: ...gently down the stream.
H: Ah, yes...

% The boat nears a waterfall.  Bart doesn't see it because he's rowing.
% Homer is facing the wrong way.

B: Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily...

% And over it goes.

B: (*gasp*)
B+H: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

% (*splash*)
%
% The boat emerges from the mist.  Two very tired fisherman aboard.

B: [with lost enthusiasm, spoken] Life is but a dream.

% [End of Act Four.  Time: 1:25]
