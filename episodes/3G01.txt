> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   Homer's claim of an alien sighting (after 10 beers) brings town-wide
   disdain -- and FBI agents Scully and Mulder to investigate.  {btg}

==============================================================================
> Title sequence
==============================================================================
         [first complete opening since 2F32 on April 1995 --ed]

Blackboard :- The truth is not out there
              The truth is not/ at cutoff.

Lisa's Solo:- Very fragmented, recycled from 9F07

               [and possibly 8F09/8F17 as well, could anyone with this
               solo compare? --ed]

Couch      :- Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa fly in the room with backpack
              rockets and sit on the couch. Maggie flies in more wildly,
              makes a few loops, and lands on Marge's lap.

==============================================================================
> Did you notice...
==============================================================================
   ... Mrs. Glick is now in the Springfield Retirement Castle instead of
       the house she lived in in 7F21?
   ... Fox Mulder is in a bikini in his FBI badge photo?
   ... Fat Tony's mugshot in Police Chief Wiggum's office?
   ... all of the camping equipment is property of Ned Flanders?

Dale G. Abersold:
   ... both "Bleeding Gums" Murphy and Dr. Marvin Monroe appear in the
       opening sequence, even though they've both been dead for over a
       year?
   ... this is the first episode written by Reid Harrison?
   ... Mrs. Glick is in the Springfield Retirement Castle now?
   ... Devil's Tower and crop circles on the front and back covers of
       "Junior Skeptic Magazine"?
   ... the "No Fat Alien Chicks" t-shirts?

Stephan Bonneville:
   ... the vulgarities in the breakfast scene?
   ... Homer has fourteen marshmallows on his stick?
   ... it only takes Moe and a couple of others to lift a whale?
   ... the FBI has a Springfield branch?

Frederic Briere:
   ... the "Ladies Night Tues" sign at Moe's?
   ... the Springfield FBI branch building has escaped the "El Barto"
       plague?
   ... the camera's birthday tag was captured in Nimoy's illustration?
   ... the overhead mike when Nimoy runs away?

Vince Chan:
   ... Homer's shirt said "sit on it"?
   ... Homer drank out of a bottle instead of a beer mug?

James R. Curry:
   ... Leonard Nimoy has a skull and a cobweb on his desk?
   ... the lights appear to be on in the music store next door to Moe's
       at 1 am?
   ... Moe cares enough to give Homer the breathalyzer test?
   ... someone, somewhere, has actually paid for a giant billboard
       simply reading "DIET"?
   ... the excellent moving shadows effect when the 'alien' emerges from
       the trees?
   ... Chief Wiggum has a half eaten doughnut on his desk, and
       apparently rests his arms on it?
   ... Bart is still up after Marge is in bed?

Joshua Fruhlinger:
   ... Moe has a penchant for black-and-white endangered species? (First
       the pandas in "Cape Feare," now the killer whale.)
   ... Scully wanders off, rolling her eyes, during Mulder's rant?
   ... Leonard Nimoy joins Troy McClure as someone who both coexists
       with The Simpsons characters, and at other times treats them as
       fictional?
   ... despite having the funds to hire the best medical care, Burns has
       Dr. Nick on his medical staff?  (It seems to me that this would
       be equivalent to having Lionel Hutz on his legal staff.)

Don Del Grande:
   ... in the alien lineup were Marvin the Martian (from Warner
       Brothers), Gort (from "The Day The Earth Stood Still"), Chewbacca
       (from "Star Wars"), ALF, and either Kang or Kodos?
   ... the front of Homer's work area is now clear, unlike 2F10 (where
       the "demotivational plaque" was)?
   ... this is the first time Marge calls Snowball II "bad cat"?
   ... there was a glass on Maggie's high chair?  (Since when does
       Maggie use a glass?)
   ... Homer has an analog alarm clock on his side of the bed, while
       Marge has a digital one on hers?
   ... Springfield is in "the heartland of America", which is not
       exactly hurricane country?
   ... while most cameo characters have white skin, Mulder and Scully
       are the same yellow that the Simpsons are?
   ... Bart has slippers?  (I'm pretty sure this is the first time he's
       worn them)
   ... Lisa is unimpressed by the video tape?
   ... Mulder knocked on the Simpson door with his left hand?

Jason Hancock:
   ... the video game sound as Donkey Kong lifts and throws the barrel?
   ... the Terminator, "My Dinner With Andre," and the Panamanian
       Strongman video games behind Milhouse?
   ... the black coffee mug with the white "X" next to Scully's
       computer?
   ... this is the first time Kang (or Kodos) has appeared in a
       non-Treehouse of Horror episode?
   ... this is the Generic Teenager's first speaking role since "Bart
       the Fink" (3F12)?
   ... Apu, a vegetarian, is at the hot dog stand?
   ... in the end, Chewbacca and Scully are both wearing "HOMER IS A
       DOPE" T-shirts?

Chris Herold:
   ... the alien's voice sounds like Michael Jackson?
   ... it takes Homer 2 hours and 10 minutes to respond to the reflex
       test?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the Russian music when the breath meter reaches Boris Yeltsin?
   ... Mulder, Scully, and Chewbacca were singing with the
       Springfieldians?
   ... Mulder and Chewie wore the Homer is a Dope shirts?

Haynes Lee:
   ... the "Labor Laws" notice in SNPP coffee room?
   ... Cigarette Smoking Man aka Cancer Man in the interrogation room?
   ... Riviera's medical instrument looks like the dentist's gouger from
       9F15?
   ... Scully looks like the health inspector from 2F16?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... Leonard Nimoy is being animated improperly? (his hair's grayed
       and he has a beard)
   ... Milhouse and Jimbo are cutting class?
   ... the "DIET" billboard says nothing besides "DIET?"
   ... Lisa and Bart have oreos and milk before watching TGIF?
   ... how odd it is that Ned makes everything he owns stamped with the
       "Property of Ned Flanders" label?
   ... the Simpsons would attend Ned's birthday party in order to steal
       his present?
   ... Mr. Burns' health is fleeing?  (first leprosy, then a boweling,
       and then these extensive treatments)
   ... Homer drinks quite a few times in this episode? (at Moe's, then
       at Moe's again during the investigation and has a beer while
       camping with Bart)

Dallas Pesola:
   ... the unsolved Rubik's Cube on Dr. Hibbert's desk?

Benjamin J. Robinson:
   ... we hear the full closing theme (allowing for the part that Hank
       Hill talked over) for the first time in ages?

Liam J. Scanlan:
   ... the flower pattern behind Leonard Nimoy at the very start?
   ... the start of this story is halfway through the book?
   ... the Springfield Shopper is available in Washington, D.C.?

Andrius Schmid:
   ... Homer asks for two "Homer is a dope" shirts, even though he was
       just told they were sold out?

==============================================================================
> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
==============================================================================
+  Homer's only been working at SNPP since 1980.  The tape of Homer
   working has the feeling of the mid to late 70s.  Besides, even if it
   _was_ 1980, Homer's only been a safety technician in sector 7-G since
   1990.

=  The writing on Moe's breathalizer changes between scenes.

*  Marge tells Homer that it is 2 AM, then checks the clock.  {as}

=  Lisa's "Junior Skeptic" magazine appears out of thin air.  {ol}

*  Marge, at least, ought to have remembered Homer's birthday.  {bjr}

+  OFF doesn't know Santa's Little Helper's birthday; his previous owner
   never mentioned it when he got rid of the dog in 7G08.

    [Theodore Miller hypothesizes that racing greyhounds may come with
    pedigree papers listing their date of birth --ed]

*  Homer tells Wiggum that the alien appears every Friday night, even
   though he saw it only once.  {tg}

+  Homer seems to be fond of Urkel, unlike 1F11.  {dga}

*  FBI stands for "Federal Bureau of Investigation", but Mulder's badge
   clearly says "Investigations".  {ddg}

*  Abe can still say "s" correctly dispite the fact the turtle has his
   teeth.  {ljs}

*  Contrary to what Moe believes (he refers to the "whale" as being
   heavy), a Killer Whale is actually a dolphin, not a whale.  IN his
   defense, however, biologists believe that the two families (dolphins
   and whales, not Simpsons and whales) are closely related.  {as}

=  The crocidile can still say "coors" even with his mouth closed.
   {ljs}

+  Bart _did_ get a fake ID before in 3F17 and did go for a beer at
   Moe's.  He passed it up when he saw all the bummed out drunks.  {ol}

+  Why would someone offer Ned a camcorder?  He already has one, which
   he not only lent to Homer in 7F11, but used to film his movie in
   2F31.  {ol}

+  Channel 6 calls its newscasts "Action News" (cf. 7G12, 2F05, and
   others), not "Eyewitness News."  {jh}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  An amusing enough episode, even if it did not live up
   to the heavy hype given it by Fox.  All three guest voices were
   well-done (I liked Nimoy's singing), and there were many good gags.
   Still, parts of the show had a "recycled" feeling, as if Jean & Reiss
   threw in every joke that they never got around to using in "The
   Critic."  (B-)
 
Vince Chan:  Amazing! No wonder this episode was on reserve. This was
   the best episode I've seen this season! I was literally ROFL. The
   part where Mr. Burns asks if Smithers was going to be doing something
   gay was hilarious! The same goes for Homer blowing up the lie
   detector. The only thing bad about this episodes was that by judging
   the title, you would think it would be a X-Files parody.  (A-)

Chris Courtois:  "The Springfield Files" was a mixed bag for me. Almost
   every laugh-out-loud moment (the alien line-up, Mulder's badge photo,
   Homer hitting on Scully) was matched by a groaner that sent my finger
   flying to the fast-forward button during a repeat viewing (the
   obligatory FOX bashing, everyone ignoring Homer's birthday in favor
   of Santa's Little Helper, the ending song). It seems that Al Jean and
   Mike Reiss were still operating in "Critic" mode, and not in
   original-"Simpsons" mode, as evidenced by the abundance of references
   and more wacky, random-gag style of humor. (If I didn't know better,
   I would have tagged this as a Mirkin-era episode). The crossover
   aspect wasn't bad, nowhere near as cheesy as I'd feared.  (B)

Steve Frayne:  This episode was above average for this season, and I
   really liked the jokes at the expense of the X-files.  Mulder and
   Scully served really no purpose in this episode, but why not promote
   a network show- it wouldn't be the first time.  It was consistantly
   funny throughout, but never drop dead hilarious.  I was surprised
   that such a dilemma could be solved with a decent ending.  This one
   was superior like the one's of old.  (B-)

Joshua Fruhlinger:  The best episode of the season so far, possibly the
   best in the last two years.  While being an Xphile as well as a
   Simpsons fan helped, I have to think that this episode stands on its
   own as well.  Great gags, great plot.  Though I really thought the
   alien was going to turn out to be Hans Moleman, mutated after being
   left alone in Dr. Hibbert's X-Ray Machine.  I was practically in
   tears from the beginning with Leanord Nimoy's introduction.  Other
   favorite bits -  "Dooff," Scully hypnotized by Homer's jiggling
   blubber, the alien line up, and the mob's reaction to the
   Burns-alien's declarations of peace and love ("It's got love!  Break
   its legs!")  The Speed bit was funny, too.  (A)

Jason Hancock:  Wow!  This is easily the funniest episode since "Bart on
   the Road" in my book.  I couldn't stop laughing for much of the show,
   especially during the "Waterworld" video game scene.  And even though
   I'm not a regular X-Files viewer, I thought their stars turned in
   good guest roles.  This probably would have worked out better as a
   Halloween episode, but I liked it nonetheless.  (A)

Patrick Hayden:  For the most part, I thought tonight's episode was
   pretty much average. I liked all the x-file jokes, especially
   Mulder's rant, but for the most part, I felt like I was watching a
   recycled episode.  For instance, Marge getting nervous when Mulder
   and Scully come to the door.  Haven't we seen Homer do that, in the
   stealing cable episode, when the cops come to watch the fight?  Then,
   Moe and the killer whale.  This seems oddly familiar to "Cape Feare"
   when Moe is hiding the pandas in the back of the store.  In fact,
   it's eaxctly the same gag.  Nothing too original there.  The musical
   number bit was used only a few episodes ago.  Also, a lot of the
   humor seemed forced, like that weak Speed bit, and the whole family
   loving the dog instead of Homer.  And while its sort of pleasant to
   have Leonard Nimoy on, his role was absolutely pointless.  Plus, the
   ending really was stupid.  Just another, HAHA, Burns sure does wierd
   things to stay alive joke, which we've seen in one form another
   countless times. Nonetheless, I was laughing pretty consistantly
   throughout the second act.  (C+)

Chris Herold:  This episode is the best episode of the season so far. It
   was full of hysterical references, such as "Water World," the
   Budweiser frogs, and Donkey Kong.  The plot was in true Simpsons
   fashion, where a family member gets his/her moment of fame.  The
   alien police line and the turtle with Abe's teeth capped off an the
   type of episode I've been waiting for!  (B)

Mark Kinash:  This was a definitive Simpsons classic.  It's a relief to
   find funny jokes that do not necessarily have anything to do with the
   plot i.e The Waterworld gag, the shot at ABC's TGIF night.  Although
   to some these may seem recycled,  I feel that these jokes give an
   element of surprise to an otherwise predictable episode (I could see
   those Mulder jokes coming a mile away).  I can actually see most of
   these jokes coming from the whimsical unconcious's of the writers,
   rather than at a FOX pitch meeting.  This is even better that
   "Homer's Voyage"!  I declare this episode the best of the season (so
   far).  (A)

Ondre Lombard:  The best of the season!  Finally, an episode that packs
   something of a punch.  Scully and Mulder's appearances were certainly
   not wasted.  This episode had quite a few funny moments, including
   most of act 1 and Bart's slashing on all four networks.  It was
   refreshing to finally see in 20 months the full length opening.
   Complaints: too many reused jokes, Leonard Nimoy's appearance was
   largely unfunny and I could'v edone with out him, the ends of act two
   and three fell flat and the plot was kinda weak.  (B)

Nate Patrin:  Ugh, ugh, retch. I'm sorry, I really expected something
   funny out of this episode, but aside from the Nimoy intro, the
   exploding lie detector and a couple other small things this episode's
   jokes were predictable, corny, cheesy, dated, poorly thought-out and
   just plain embarrassing. The premise? Done to death. The crossover?
   Anticlimactic. I really hate to say this, but this episode blew.  (D-)

Werner Peeters:  Now THIS is a great episode. Although I'm not too
   familiar with the X-files, and probably missed therefore half of the
   jokes, I still find this episode had one brilliant moment after
   another: The whale at Moe's Tavern, Homer's writing in the grass,
   Bart's scary story about Maggie's college funds, the picknick with
   Ned's equipment, the line-up with the aliens, Boris Yeltsin and of
   course the brilliant intervention of Leonard Nimoy! Matt Groening was
   ashamed of the Critic crossover, but I don't think he will be ashamed
   of this one!  (A+)

Benjamin J. Robinson:  We had to wait forever for this one, but it was
   worth it.  Homer's encounter with what is possibly an alien is
   consistently funny, with pop culture references galore.  Guest stars
   Duchovney, Anderson, and Nimoy get good roles, rather than being
   tacked on as an afterthought. The ending is a letdown, but this is a
   solid episode in spite of that.  (A-)

Matt Rose:  Decent. I wouldn't say it's as good as I've heard the
   critics and newsgroup people have said it was (so far) but it wasn't
   bad. My expectations were quite low because usually the hyped up
   episodes ("Homerpalooza", "Who Shot, Part 2") have disappointed me.
   This one didn't. I laughed hardest when the Budweiser frogs were
   eaten (I for one like many are sick of those damn commercials) and
   when Mr. Burns asks Smithers if he's doing something "gay". Two
   things I didn't for: the musical number near the end (this is one
   trend I don't want to see continue) and once again the lack of
   involvement from the kids, esp. Lisa. But the episode worked for me.
   I probably would have been won over more if I was an"X-Files" watcher
   but I rarely watch the show.  (B)

Andrius Schmid:  This was a well-made episode.  The use of Mulder and
   Scully was tactful and not overdone.  I am also glad that the actual
   Sci-Fi aspect of the episode was kept down to an acceptable minimum.
   Although this episode was not as good as "Lisa'a Date with Destiny,"
   the large amount of gags made it quite worthwhile. (A-)

Yours Truly:  Although this crossover did avoid to sell another show, it
   was still trying to sell its own, and make X-Files viewers more
   Simpsons-aware. In the long run, the effect wasn't any better:
   Simpsons humor was "lowered" for the uninitiated. Many jokes were
   re-used or cliches (Moe's panda/whale), while others were too obvious
   or silly to have much impact (painful TV bashing, and the most
   unsubtle Smithers joke to date). Of what little remained, the writers
   made sure to underline and highlight every bit of it, just so that it
   would be impossible to miss anything (look, Mulder's badge is
   funny!). I am quite willing to forgive all of this in the name of
   this episode's good cause, but I would rather not see any more of it.

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Crossover Comments

Joshua Fruhlinger:  The "real" Mulder and Scully live in a universe
   where "The Simpsons" TV series exists.  During the episode
   "Revelations," (3X11) Mulder comments that a composite sketch of a
   bald suspect looks like "Homer Simpson's evil twin".  Makes you
   wonder... when Mulder plops down on his couch Sunday nights and
   watches the Simpsons and then King of the Hill, what comes on next?
   Millenium, if he's unlucky.  Alternately, one could posit that the
   action of "The Springfield Files" took place before "Revelations" and
   he was commenting on Homer Simpson, the man they met, not Homer
   Simpson, the cartoon.  But that, there is no need to add, is
   exceedingly unlikely and just silly.

   There's a funny gag in the first scene of The Springfield Files with
   Mulder and Scully, in which Mulder suggests they go chase after
   Homer's potential alien, and Scully asks why they don't go and do the
   sort of stuff FBI is supposed to be doing i.e. law inforcement.  This
   was made even funnier by the fact that, in the X-Files episode that
   aired half an hour later, (El Mundo Gira, 4X11) Mulder and Scully
   investigate strange doings in an illegal immigrants' migrant camp, in
   which they are surrounded by people who are in the country illegally,
   a fact they more or less ignore.

      [Thanks to Alyssa Fernandez for the correct quote --ed]


Ted Graham:  In the scene where Homer recreates his experience in the
   bar, Mulder, looking bored, is casually eating nuts of some sort from
   a bowl. It's a well-established fact that the character is addicted
   to sunflower seeds.


Steve Bird: Fox's FBI ID is a picture of himself posing mostly nude.  (I
   believe he was wearing a "Banana Hammock.")  David Duchovny, before
   being cast in "The X Files,"  was in a cable show called "The Red
   Shoe Diaries," which bordered on soft-core porn.


>> Jay Sherman, no -- Mulder and Scully, si!

Benjamin J. Robinson:  After the acrimony that surrounded "A Star is
   Burns (2F31)" -- see the capsule for that episode for further details
   -- one would think that the word "crossover" would be forbidden
   around the "Simpsons" studios. The X Files crossover seems to have
   gone more smoothly, though.  There hasn't been any outward sign of
   ill will, and Matt Groening's name does appear in the credits.  (He
   had it removed from "A Star is Burns.") Perhaps he felt there was
   more of a difference between "The Simpsons" and "The X Files" than
   "The Simpsons" and "The Critic."  Perhaps he warmed up to the notion
   of a crossover since the earlier show aired. Perhaps they just asked
   him nicely.  Whatever the reason, this crossover episode looks like a
   more cooperative episode than the first.


>> The Bus that Couldn't Slow Down

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Homer's recollection of "Speed" is pretty good.
   In the movie, the hero (Keanu Reeves) discovers the bad guy (Dennis
   Hopper) has placed a video camera on the bus to keep tabs on his
   victims.  If anyone tried to escape the bus, Hopper would know about
   it.  Reeves foils this plan by creating a tape loop of the passengers
   just sitting there.  The good guys broadcast this back to Hopper on
   the camera's transmission frequency.  He was fooled -- for a while.
   The tape had a small discontinuity near the "seam" of the loop (more
   subtle than in Homer's loop) which let Hopper know Reeves was on to
   his little scheme.


>> Videogame Roots

Benjamin J. Robinson:  The original Donkey Kong game was incredibly
   popular in the early Eighties.  The premise was simple.  An ape --
   the Donkey Kong of the title -- kidnapped a princess.  Scaling some
   girders, he hid out at the top of a construction site.  A little
   mustachioed man, later called Mario, went after her.  To stop him,
   Donkey Kong would roll barrels down the girders.  Mario had to jump
   over the barrels, or get killed. Once he got to the top of the
   girders the cycle would repeat until the player ran out of turns, or
   went nuts.  This one game spawned more sequels than James Bond, and
   was the predecessor of today's Nintendo Mario games.  You'd think
   that ape would be a better draw.

Jason Hancock:  I think the Donkey Kong joke was thrown in because of
   Mario's popularity. Thanks to the Super Mario Bros. series of games,
   Mario became Nintendo's big star of the late eighties while Donkey
   Kong fell into video game obscurity and remained there until "Donkey
   Kong Country" was released.

Frederic Briere:  The original arcade Donkey Kong was released in 1981.
   It is funny to see how Nintendo pulled this character from the closet
   in order to both promote its Super Game Boy bundle and milk all the
   money from its dying Super NES system. A well calculated move, as the
   1994 Donkey Kong Country dethroned Super Mario Bros. 3 as best-
   selling videogame worldwide. The two sequels did very well too, and
   are still among the most rented games nowadays.


>> The collegiate future of an incredibly-voiced hellion

   An interesting discussion emerged after Bart's comment on Maggie's
   college costs:

Don Del Grande:  Those of us in CHARMS [Company of Honorable and Ardent
   Revellers of Maggie Simpson] know that it won't cost Homer ANYTHING
   to send Maggie to college, since she'll probably have universities
   paying HER to attend.

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Those of us outside of CHARMS suggest that this
   may not be so. In "Lisa's Wedding (2F15)," for example, see looked
   like the rebellious type -- probably not the sort who would go for
   the college scene. That doesn't necessarily mean she'll be a loser;
   there are plenty of lucrative vocational careers out there.

   Personally, I think it would be an interesting twist of fate if, on
   her way to collect her Nobel Prize, Lisa's car broke down and she had
   to be rescued by Maggie the Mechanic.

Don Del Grande:  Then again, those of us crazy enough to say that we ARE
   in CHARMS don't necessarily see a contradiction between "Maggie the
   rebel" and "Maggie the college student". (Can you think of a worse
   nightmare for a teacher, or a principal, than a student with the
   brains of Lisa and the attitude of Bart - or, for all we know, the
   attitude of Jimbo and the brains of Martin?) But I do agree that the
   future of "Lisa's Wedding" is not considered to be "definite", unlike
   Bart the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as shown in "Itchy &
   Scratchy: The Movie" (or Homer at his 40th(?) reunion with a plunger
   on his head, at the end of "The Front").


>> Those... Damn... Frogs...

Jason Hancock:  For the past two years or so, Budweiser has been using
   frogs that say "Bud... weis... er" in its beer commercials.  They are
   among the most recognizable TV commercial characters.  However, they
   have also been the targets of complaints from Mothers Against Drunk
   Driving for their appeal to children.


>> Goodness! Grandma, what big eyes you have!

Chris Herold:  During his medical treatments, Mr. Burns' eyes are
   dilated by application of eye drops that in all likelihood contain
   tropicamide. Tropicamide inhibits the action of acetylcholine, a
   neurotransmitter that decreases the diameter of the pupil by
   contracting the pupillary sphincter muscle.  Application of
   tropicamide by eye drops dilates the eyes for several hours and
   enables an ophthalmologist to look into your eyes and examine the
   retina.


>> "Oh, sorry, I meant 'my half-life'"

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Mr. Burns must have exaggerated a little when he
   said he spent his whole life in the nuclear power business. America's
   first nuclear power plant went on-line in 1946.  (And boy, I'll bet
   radiation control was really something back then.)  If Burns is 104
   today, he'd have been 49 when he started working with nuclear power.


>> Good Morning Sunshine

Greg Bigoni:  The song that the characters sing at the end was a hit in
   1969 for singer Oliver (pretty much his only hit), but it originally
   was in the 1968 "tribal love-rock musical," "Hair." The play is
   basically about a bunch of hippies vs. society, and given the theme,
   is surprisingly good. "Good Morning Starshine" is sung near the end
   of the musical, when the hippie tribe has just come down from their
   long hallucinogenic trip, as they're saying goodbye to their friend
   Claude the morning he leaves for Vietnam. The mood expressed in that
   scene is pretty similar to how they did it in this episode, too, with
   the big "I bring you peace/love" chorus, swaying back and forth with
   their arms around each other (that's how we blocked it in the
   production that I was in, anyway, complete with the arms raised at
   the end). Their little homage worked pretty well, IMHO. Pretty funny
   stuff.


>> Sing us a song, Mr. Spock

Regarding the question of whether or not "Good Morning Sunshine" had
   once been recorded by Leonard Nimoy...

Alan Hamilton:  The only album I've seen is "The Two Sides of Leonard
   Nimoy", which has covers of such ditties as "If I Were A Carpenter"
   and "Gentle on my Mind", but no "Starshine".  And "The Ballad of
   Bilbo Baggins" has to be heard to be believed.

   www.mrshowbiz.com shows him recording "Leonard Nimoy Presents Mr.
   Spock's Music From Outer Space" 1967; "Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy",
   "The Way I Feel 1968"; "The Touch of Leonard Nimoy", "The New World
   of Leonard Nimoy" 1969.  He also did some narration and book
   readings.


>> Those Immortal Threads

   - Where is Springfield?

Benjamin J. Robinson:  When people refer to a city as being in a
   nation's heartland, they usually mean that it has a central location
   in that country.  This would put Springfield in the American Midwest.


   - Is Smithers Gay?

Dale G. Abersold:  Smithers is shocked when Burns asks him if he has
   anything "gay" planned for the weekend, but chuckles nervously when
   he hears that Burns used the word in its more traditional meaning.

Melissa R. Hirshson:  Hasn't been Smithers been trying to tell Burns for
   years how he feels about him? Then, why would he get so scared when
   Burns first mentions the word "gay"? Maybe he's been so discouraged
   in the past by Burns' obvious unawareness of his feelings that he's
   gone further and further into the closet?


>> Loose Ends

   - Writer Watch

Dale G. Abersold:  This is Reid Harrison's first outing as a writer for
   the Simpsons. Previously, he has worked for Warner Brothers on the
   "Pinky and the Brain" show.

   - Why wasn't Lisa's solo based on The X Files?

Bob Beecher, music editor for the show:

   Lisa's sax solo was recorded many times and the decision as to which
   one shows up in the main title rests usually with the music editor. I
   picked my favorite for this show -- the funky one!

   We could've recorded an X-Files sax solo, but no one thought of it.
   Plus, Mark Snow's already getting enough for the use of his theme!

   - Hallowe'en episode?

Dale G. Abersold:  Given the non-canonical nature of this episode (it
   was told to us, after all, by Leonard Nimoy), I wonder if it was
   originally intended for use as a Hallowe'en episode?

   - A few good names

Benjamin J. Robinson provides us with a quick background of different
   personalities mentioned on this episode:

   Boris Yeltsin
      President of Russia, who is widely rumored to be a two-fisted
      drinker.
   J. Edgar Hoover
      Longtime FBI director.  Recent rumor has it that he was a closet
      cross-dresser.
   Ludwig Wittgenstein
      Philosopher who wrote "Tractatus Logico-philosophous."  I'll bet
      Homer learned about him from Lisa.

   - This makes him very angry

Marge Starbrod-Simpson:  You may remember Marvin the Martian from: 7
   Looney Tunes segments. He was also the referee in "Space Jam" and
   Tai's and Travis's mutual obsession in "Clueless".

% witless.  Homer runs into the woods and runs into Grampa, who was
% hiding in the bushes.

Grampa: Oh son, I'm glad to see you!  I went for the morning paper and I
        got lost!  And...
 Homer: No time for you, old man!
         [pushes Grampa aside]
-- Don't interrupt a man in the middle of a cowardice panic,
      "The Springfield Files"

% Homer plows through a mess of branches and plants and runs across a
% log in the middle of the misty night.  For effect, an owl hoots. Homer
% trips over a branch.  (For more effect, the chilling music most
% associated with "The X-Files" begins to play)  What he sees before him
% is an eerie, green glowing figure with a large bulbous head, enormous
% dark eyes and a contorted, spindly body.

Homer: Please!  Don't hurt me!
Alien: [gentle voice] Don't be afraid.
Homer: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!
        [begins running through the field of grass, creating a
        handwritten writing of "Yahhh!" in the grass]
-- Your typical alien encounter, "The Springfield Files"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 5:21]
%
% Homer busts through the door of his bedroom, panting, awakening Marge.

Marge: Homer, it's 2 am.  What happened?
Homer: It was an alien, Marge!  It appeared in front of me and said
       "Don't be Afraid."
Marge: [waving her hand in front her nose]  Have you been drinking?
Homer: No!  Well, ten beers.
-- Ticks'll do that to you, "The Springfield Files"

% Homer tells his unbelieveable tale at the breakfast table.

Homer: I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet.
 Lisa: Maybe you just dreamed it.
Homer: Oh yeah?  Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky,
       translucent goo.  Explain that!
Marge: [serves him] More sausage?
        [Homer starts drooling]
-- Occam's Razor to its gruesomest, "The Springfield Files"

 Lisa: Dad, according to "Junior Skeptic Magazine," the chances are 175
       million to one of another form of life actually coming in contact
       with ours.
Homer: So?
 Lisa: It's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are
       always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs.  Oh, and you, Dad.
       [nervous laugh]
-- Once a skeptic, always a skeptic, "The Springfield Files"

% Bart, "The Thing, from Uranus," greets the family dressed in novelty
% spring goggles, a bike helmet with antennaes on top and a black shirt
% while holding a water soaker, making light of Homer's supposed alien
% encounter.

Homer: [gasps, then realizes] Oh, it's Bart.  I can't believe it.  I'm
       being mocked.  By my own children.  On my birthday.
 Bart: It's your birthday?
Homer: Yes!  Remember, it's the same day as the dog's.
 Lisa: Santa's Little Helper, it's your birthday?  Ooh!  We've gotta get
       you a present.  [cuddling him]  Yes we do!  Yes we do!
 Bart: [cuddling him]  We love you boy.
Marge: [cuddling him]  Good doggie.  Good doggie.
        [Maggie joins in, leaving Homer alone at the table]
Homer: Lousy loveable dog.
-- Yet with an untwistable stomach, "The Springfield Files"

% Homer tells his unbelieveable tale at the SNPP.

Oh, it was awful!  They set me on a cold, metal table.  Then prodded me
with humiliating probes, and then...  Oh wait, that was my physical.
-- From `The X Files' to `General Hospital', "The Springfield Files"

% At the police station, Homer tells his unbelieveable tale to Chief
% Wiggum.

 Homer: The alien has a sweet, heavenly voice... like Urkel!  And he
        appears every Friday night... like Urkel!
Wiggum: Well, your story is _very_ compelling, Mr. Jackass, I mean, uh,
        Simpson.  So, I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter!
         [Wiggum raises his arms and starts typing on air in sarcasm]
         [starts humming]
 Homer: You don't have to humiliate me.
         [Homer walks off, and another man walks in, wearing slightly
         burned clothes and playing compulsively with a lighter]
   Man: I just torched a building downtown, and I'm afraid I'll do it
        again!
Wiggum: Oh, yeah, right.  I'll just type it up on my invisible
        typewriter!
         [goes through the same sarcastic routine]
        Fruitcake!
-- Why _do_ you wear that badge, anyway? "The Springfield Files"

% We are then taken to the F.B.I. Division of Paranormal Activites.
% Inside the office, there is a picture of J. Edgar Hoover in a lady's
% dress, joined by other spooky pictures.  An attractive red-head is
% working at her computer.  Her attractive, brown-haired partner shows
% her a paper about Homer's alleged alien encounter.

Mulder: There's been another unsubstantiated UFO sighting in the
        Heartland of America.  We've gotta get there right away.
Scully: Well... gee, Mulder, there's also this report of a shipment of
        drugs and illegal weapons coming into New Jersey tonight.
Mulder: [scoffs] I hardly think the FBI is concerned with matters like
        that.
-- That's for overpaid, obese policemen with invisible typewriters,
      "The Springfield Files"

% At the Simpsons home, Mulder gives a slight knock on the front door.
% Marge answers, and panics at the sight of F.B.I. agents, thinking
% they're after her for the pen she took from the Post Office.  Swearing
% she didn't know it was in her purse, and that she was about to bring
% it back when the dog chewed it up, she starts hyperventilating. Mulder
% informs her that their matter is with Homer.  Still panting, Marge
% greets them in.
%
% At the FBI Springfield Branch, Mulder and Scully tell Homer to pick
% out from a lineup the alien that he saw.  But Marvin the Martian,
% Gort, Chewbacca, ALF and Kang (or is it Kodos?) don't fit the bill.

Oh, this makes me very angry!
-- Marvin, the clicheic, Martian, "The Springfield Files"

% The Cigarette Smoking Man in the shadows watches Mulder and Scully
% conduct a polygraph test on Homer.

Scully: Now, we're going to run a few tests.  This is a simple lie
        detector.  I'll ask you a few yes or no questions and you just
        answer truthfully.  Do you understand?
 Homer: Yes.
         [the polygraph explodes]
-- It worked, all right, "The Springfield Files"

% Scully tests Homer's reflexes.  It takes quite a while before Homer
% feels the pain and says "Oww."
%
% Later, with wires attached to him, Homer runs on a treadmill in naught
% but his underwear.  Mulder and Scully watch.

Mulder: Wait a minute, Scully.  What's the point of this test?
Scully: No point.  I just thought he could stand to lose a little
        weight.
Mulder: His jiggling is almost hypnotic.
Scully: Yes.  It's like a lava lamp.
-- "The Springfield Files"

% Mulder amd Skully then take their investigation to Moe's.

Mulder: All right, Homer.  We want you to re-create your every move the
        night you saw this alien.
 Homer: Well, the evening began at the gentleman's club, where we were
        discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.
Scully: Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the F.B.I.
 Homer: We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard.  You
        happy?
-- "The Springfield Files"

% Homer later makes himself as drunk as he was before and begins to make
% a pass at Scully.

_You_ are one fine looking woman, lady.  If I wasn't married, I'd go out
with you like _that_!
 [hits his bottle on the bar; beer bubbles and spills out the bottle]
I am _so_ sorry!  Whatever you do, don't tell Marge!  God, I love her!
I... hey!  A penny!
 [leaps into the floor]
-- Homer recreates his every move (and bottle), "The Springfield Files"

% Scully and Mulder introduce themselves to Moe at his request, and
% their FBI credentials alarm Moe, who orders the men in the backroom
% watering a disgruntled killer whale to take him back to Sea World.
%
% Homer, meanwhile, continues to waste the bored FBI agents' time.

So, I says, blue M&M, red M&M, they all wind up the same color in the
end.
-- Homer's answers to life's greatest mysteries, "The Springfield Files"

% Scully invites Homer to lead them to his next location on the night of
% his encounter.  The three wind up in the park.  Homer points to the
% woods where the creature emerged; just at that moment, there's
% rustling in a bush.  All gasp, and Scully cocks a gun, fearing the
% worst.  To their (somewhat) relief, Grampa emerges in his tattered
% clothes.

Grampa: For the love of god, help me!  I've been here for four days and
        that turtle's got all of my teeth!
        [looking down]  There he is!
         [the turtle walks away, holding the oversized denture]
Grampa: [running as slowly as the turtle]  Come back here, you!  Slow
        down!  I'll get you!
Scully: This is the worst assignment we've ever had.
Mulder: Worse than the time we were attacked by the flesh-eating virus?
Grampa: [gets bitten by the turtle]  Oww!  It bit me with my own teeth!
Scully: No, this is much more irritating.
-- "The Springfield Files"

% Scully decides she's seen enough, and leaves.  Mulder's about to
% follow, but stops to deliver a speech.

But somewhere out there, something is watching us.  There are alien
forces acting in ways we can't perceive.  Are we alone in the universe?
Impossible.  When you consider the wonders that exist all around us...
 [it's nighttime now, and everyone's left Mulder alone in the park]
...voodoo priests of Haiti, the Tibetan numerologists of Appalachia, the
unsolved mysteries of -- "Unsolved Mysteries."  The truth is out there.
-- Mulder, as skeptic as we know him, "The Springfield Files"

% Behind him, Moe and the two men are hauling away the killer whale.

Oh, who thought a whale could be so heavy?!  [sees Mulder]  Cheese it!
The feds!
-- Moe, "The Springfield Files"

% Homer talks to Marge in bed.

Homer: Oh Marge, I never felt so alone.  No one believes me.  [pause]
       Uh, this is the part where you're suppose to say "I Believe You,
       Homer"?
Marge: I don't believe you, Homer.
Homer: You do??  Oh, Marge, you've made me so happy!
Marge: Hmm, you're not listening.  You're only hearing what you wanna
       hear.
Homer: Thanks!  I'd love an omelette right about now.
-- "The Springfield Files"

% Marge tries to wake him up.

Marge: I try to be supportive, but this has gone too far!  Please, just
       let it be?
Homer: No, I can't.  This is my cause.  I'm like the man who
       singlehandedly built the rocket and went to the moon.  What was
       his name?  Apollo Creed?
-- How long before he cries `Adrienne!', "The Springfield Files"

% Insulted by Marge's lack of trust for him, Homer leaves the bedroom,
% and sulks at the breakfast table.  Bart comes in.

 Bart: Hey, Dad.  What's the word with Planet Crackpot?
Homer: Oh, I suppose _you're_ going to mock me, too!
 Bart: Well, actually, Dad... I believe you.
Homer: You do?
 Bart: Yes, I do.  You seem so damn sure.
Homer: Thank you, son.  And do you think you can stop the casual
       swearing?
 Bart: Hell yes.
Homer: That's my boy.
-- Darn right, "The Springfield Files"

Homer: This Friday, we're going back to the woods and we're going to
       find that alien!
 Bart: What if we don't?
Homer: We'll fake it, and sell it to the Fox network.
 Bart: [chuckles]  They'll buy _anything_.
Homer: Now, son, they do a lot of quality programming, too.
        [the two bust up laughing]
       I kill me.
-- Make sure there's no wristwatch this time, "The Springfield Files"

% Out in the woods --again-- the three "Budweizer" frogs get eaten by a
% crocodile, who grunts "Coors."  Not far away, Bart and Homer camp out
% with an assortment of Ned Flanders' belongings.

 Bart: Hey, Dad, can I have a sip of your beer?
Homer: Now, son, you don't want to drink beer.  That's for daddies and
       kids with fake IDs.
-- "The Springfield Files"

% Homer suggests a ghost story instead.  Later that night, lit with a
% flashlight, Bart completes his chilling tale: "...and that is how much
% college will cost for Maggie."  Homer screams in denial.
%
% Later, Homer and Bart roast up some marshmallows, enjoying the great
% time they're having together.
%
% That "X-Files" music starts up again, and the green glow floats
% through the trees.  Homer recognizes his encounter.

Alien: I bring you peace.
Homer: As a representative of the planet Earth, let me just say [gets
       his foot in the camp fire]  Baaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!
       [tries to beat out the fire]  Oww!!  Oww!!
-- And we really mean it, "The Springfield Files"

% The alien runs away in fear.  Homer mourns his lost proof, but Bart
% cheers him up by saying he's taped the whole thing.  Homer and Bart
% jump up and down in joy, their jumping frozen into an illustration
% that takes us back to Leonard Nimoy in the study.

   Nimoy: And so, from this simple man came the proof that we are not
          alone in the universe.  I'm Leonard Nimoy.  Good night.
Teenager: [off-camera]  Uh, Mr. Nimoy, we have ten minutes left.
   Nimoy: Oh.  Uh, fine.  Let me, uh, just get something out of my car.
          [runs off]
          [starts his car and drives off]
Teenager: I don't think he's coming back.
-- You're quick, "The Springfield Files"

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:52]

Kent: Tonight, on Eyewitness News: a man who's been in a coma for 23
      years wakes up.
 Man: Do Sonny and Cher still have that _stupid_ show?
Kent: No, uh, she won an Oscar, and he's a Congressman.
 Man: Good night!
       [turns over and dies]
-- The right choice, "The Springfield Files"

But first, E.T., phone Homer -- Simpson, that is.  Local man, Homer
Simpson, shown here with his tongue stuck to a lamppost, has given us
this videotape.
-- Those damn file photos..., "The Springfield Files"

% They show a few seconds of his video, which Kent dubs as Close
% encounter of the _blurred_ kind."

The alien has appeared in the same Springfield pasture the past two
Friday nights.  Will it appear again this Friday?  The entire Channel 6
news team will be there, except for Bill, the boom mike operator, who's
getting fired tomorrow.
 [boom mic falls and hits Kent in the head]
Very unprofessional, Bill.
-- The sorrows of the underappreciated boom mic operator,
      "The Springfield Files"

% Lisa still isn't convinced, and thinks there must be a more logical
% explanation and doubts the town will buy the story based on the tape.
% The doorbell rings.  Homer answers the door and the questions of the
% rabble of believers.

Hibbert: Is the alien carbon-based, or silicone-based?
  Homer: Uhhh... the second one.  Zillifone.  Next question?
 Barney: [drunk]  Is the alien Santa Claus?
  Homer: Uh... yes!
    Ned: Uh, where you on my roof last night stealing my weather vane?
  Homer: This interview is over!  [goes in, slams the door]
          [said weather vane falls on the "Welcome" mat]
-- And your tabletray, and camping equipment and camcorder...,
      "The Springfield Files"

% That Sunday, Lovejoy bases his sermon on Homer's encounter.

I remember another gentle visitor from the heavens.  He came in peace,
and then died, only to come back to life.  And his name was... E.T., the
extraterrestrial.  [sniffs]  I love that little guy.
-- Lovejoy reads from Spielberg's bible, "The Springfield Files"

% Later, that Friday night, the town sets up a fiasco filled with music
% and t-shirt sales in anticipation of the alien's third visit.  Mr.
% Largo gets a five-member band to practice the "Close Encounters"
% theme, Jimbo tries to get tickets to Pearl Jam, and Leonard Nimoy's
% getting a hot dog.

 Bart: Leonard Nimoy?  What are you doing here?
Nimoy: Wherever there is mystery and the unexplained, cosmic forces
       shall draw me near.
 Bart: [flippantly] Uh-huh.
  Man: Hey Spock, what do you want on your hot dog?
Nimoy: Surprise me.
        [the hot dog man hesitates, then puts a whole batch of what
        appears to be lettuce on top]
-- The surprise is what comes after you eat the hot dog,
      "The Springfield Files"

% Homer tries to prove to Lisa that he's being respected because there
% are "Homer was Right" t-shirts being sold, instead of "Homer is a
% Dope" t-shirts, which, in actuality, were sold out in five minutes.
% "D'oh!" Even Maggie and Marge are wearing those.

Homer: Marge, how could you??
Marge: These shirts are a hundred percent cotton.  And look at the fine
       stitching on "dope".
Homer: I'll take two.
-- Proving the shirts' point, "The Springfield Files"

% Clouds gather, the eerie music starts and the green glowing alien
% returns.  The entire town is flabbergasted, and Marge apologises to
% Homer for doubting him.

  Alien: I bring you love!
Hibbert: [smoking a cigar]  Is that the love between a man and a woman
         or the love of a man for a fine Cuban cigar?  [chuckles]
  Alien: Uh... I bring you love!
  Lenny: It's bringing love!  Don't let it get away!
   Carl: Break its legs!
-- Love, the harbinger of destruction, "The Springfield Files"

% The town suddenly gets an array of weaponry and start trying to attack
% the alien to capture him.  Lisa stops them by turning a flashlight on
% the alien, revealing it to actually be Mr. Burns.

   Burns: Hello, children!  I bring you love!
   Willy: Aah!  It's a monster!  Kill it!  Kill it!
Smithers: It's not a monster!  It's Mr. Burns!
   WIlly: [tender] Aw, it's Mr. Burns.  [raging] Kill it! Kill it!
-- What's the difference?, "The Springfield Files"

% Smithers urges them to hear his explanation for it all.  This is all
% the result of medical procedures designed to help Mr. Burns cheat
% death for another week, including an extensive chiropractic
% readjustment, eyedrops (which enlarge Mr. Burns' pupils), pain killers
% and a vocal chord scraping.

Don't worry.  You won't feel a thing.  [exhibiting a swirling mechanical
device]  Till I jam this down your throat!
-- Nick Riviera, "The Springfield Files"

% "The whole ordeal leaves Mr. Burns twisted and disoriented" explains
% Smithers.  Mr. Burns wanders out the hospital and off into the woods,
% where he's later seen beaming a green glow.

The most rewarding part was when he gave me my money.
-- Nick Riviera, "The Springfield Files"

 Bart: But, what's with the glowing?
Burns: Um, I'll field that question.  A lifetime of working in a nuclear
       power plant has given me a healthy green glow.  [to himself]  And
       left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.
       And now that I'm back to normal, I don't bring you peace and
       love.  I bring you fear, famine, pestilence and...
 Nick: [shooting Burns with a needle of painkiller] Time for a booster!
        [Burns reverts back to his alien-like state]
Burns: [singing] Good morning, starshine.  The Earth says hello.

% Nimoy joins in, and soon all of Springfield -- with Mulder, Scully and
% Chewbacca -- is waving together, singing "Good Morning Sunshine."
% They raise their arms in the air, and the picture is yet again frozen
% in Nemoy's book, now narrated by the Generic Teenager.

And so concludes our tale.  I'm Leonard Nimoy.  Good night, and keep
watching the skis.  Uh, skies.
-- Our favorite pimple-faced teenager of all, "The Springfield Files"

% Eerie "X-files music" closes the show.
