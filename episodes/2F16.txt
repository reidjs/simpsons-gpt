Willy's shovel disappears.  {dh}

The girl with light blue hair and green-lens glasses who sits behind
Bart now has blonde hair and clear-lens glasses.  {ddg}

Bart's classroom is on the second floor, not Lisa's.  {mk}

Bart's classroom is directly underneath Lisa's...but the oil gusher goes
through the front of Mrs. Krabappel's room and the back of Miss
Hoover's.  {ddg}

The calendar in the conference room has eight columns and four rows.
{dh2}

The express package doesn't have a To: address, and the return address
is on the wrong side of the envelope.  {mk}

When Burns' first lackey hands off the envelope, it has what appears to
be an "Air Mail" sticker justified right just above the word "LETTER"
but it isn't there when Monty hands it off.  {mk}

The package changes from having the lettering on the long way of the
envelope to the short way, and back again.  {mk}

The button on Burns' desk used to be for the chute to India in 1F07.
{mk}

A one-kilogram (1000-gram) weight falling from a tall ceiling should
hurt Homer more than that, especially if an edge hits him first.  {ddg}

Burns says "I can't make hide nor hair of these metric booby traps", but
the captions give it as "electric" instead of "metric".  {rl}

There's no sign of oil anywhere when Skinner checks the damage on the
roof.  {dh}

Burns reads the back page of the Springfield Shopper, yet the oil story
appears on the front page.  {dh}

Why on earth would the Executive Spa lead into an _employee's_ elevator?
And why would Burns ride with the employees?  {mk}

The other employees in the elevator have their ID badges on, but Homer
doesn't.  (His says "Hello, my name is Homer Simpson".)  {mk}

Chalmers' cigar doesn't appear lit in some scenes.  {dh}

In 8F03, Skinner _did_ have a secretary.  {dh}

Skinner says that Monty Burns is 104, but in 7F02 Burns claims to be
only 81.  {mk}

Skinner's briefcase disappears in one scene.  {dh}

Burns' knit cap vanishes after he throws it down on the desk.

Burns leaves Skinner's door open when he leaves, but it is closed in
some scenes.  {dh}

Skinner's door changes color.  {dh}

Smithers fires the stapler in the wrong direction for staples to land on
top of Skinner's briefcase.

Marge's legs are drawn improperly in the establishing shot of dinner.
{dh}

At dinner, Bart and Lisa both eat right-handed.  {ddg}

Since when is Lisa (and not Martin) the school's top student?  {ddg}

Mrs. Krabappel's earrings are missing in some scenes.  {dh}

How did the pipe get from the school's derrick to the oil if the hole
didn't go straight down?  {ddg}

If Burns' well didn't start gushing until after the oil level had dipped
below the school well's pipe, how did the oil level drop?  {ddg}

How did SLH get into the treehouse?  {dh}

The Flanders' garage is missing when Homer swears.  {dh}

Burns' scale model of the town changes size.  {dh}

Burns' office rug changes shape and size.  {dh}

The model of where the mountain is in relation to the town hall differs
from the actual location.  {cpm}

One of Burns' guards jumps out of nowhere.  {dh}

Abe's newspaper vanishes.  {dh}

When Bart is first shown gripping the pistol, his right hand is around
the barrel; when the scene shifts to show Marge, Bart's right hand is
now underneath the bullet chamber.  {ddg}

The whole front yard of the Town Hall vanishes when Krusty arrives.
{dh}

Wouldn't blocking out the sun cost more money than Burns would be making
from the extra electricity?  {dh}

As Mr. Burns is walking on the sidewalk after the sun is blocked, he
casts one shadow, and that seems to be from a faraway light source.
{ws}

Burns' gun changes appearance in some scenes.  {dh}

Burns' jacket is buttoned up in some scenes.  {dh}

Homer's car is missing its license plate.  {dh}

Jimbo magically appears at the tree near where Burns gets shot.  {jry}

The compass directions on the sundial indicate the town hall faces
south, yet why is the setting sun visible looking out the doors?  The
town hall should face west, in that case.  {th2}

After this, the sundial rotates to the correct orientation.  {th2}

Krusty isn't wearing his bow tie when he first arrives, but later he is.
{js}

The Sun rises from the east and sets to the west.  Burns' sun-blocker
isn't nearly mobile enough to block the sun for the whole day.  {jp}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
James Bennie: It seems everyone's so preoccupied with who shot Monty
    that no one's bothered to say (especially since this group has been
    full of posts bashing the last few episodes) that this was a great
    episode!  Some of the dialogue between Smithers and Monty was
    fabulous.

Sarah Trombley: I really liked this episode.  The sense of drama was
    skillfully created, and the jokes largely character-driven instead
    of merely surreal.  A promise of improvement for the next season?

Don Del Grande: A - but it just misses out to the Halloween Special for
    "best episode of the season".  How can Part Two top this?

Dominik Halas: I was laughing from the blackboard lines on.  This was
    truly a well done episode, worthy of being a season finale.  It is
    definitely up there with the other excellent episodes this season,
    like Lisa's Wedding and Sideshow Bob Roberts.  Grade: A.

Aaron Varhola: Oakley and Weinstein got away with broad portrayals of
    Mr. Burns as the amoral megalomaniac we know and hate, and Homer as
    the unwitting drone we remember from the first season.  This episode
    had to be made carefully, and it was; clues point to a number of
    suspects, and we get to see more of Smithers as a person.  A.

Scott Fujimoto: Well, speculations on who did it aside, I thought this
    show was pretty funny.  Lots of laughs (Skinner trying to fast-talk
    Chalmers, Burns not recognizing Homer).  Plus we get to see Burns at
    his fiendishly best.  All in all, a lively episode.  Grade: A/A-.

Benjamin Robinson: Lost in the rush to solve the Burns whodunit is the
    fact that this was a very good episode in its own right.  The most
    interesting point is that the writers actually were able to build
    _suspense_ as Mr. Burns systematically alienated the whole town.
    The real mystery is why all of this season's episodes couldn't be
    this good (8/11 -> A).

Ricardo Lafaurie: B+ - Now here's a good development - Burns gets what's
    been coming to him for a looong time!  Besides all that, it's a
    great episode except for Homer (the idea of killing him is a mite
    dumb) and Tito Puente (who stunk in here).

Tony Hill: I think the plot was rather well-done, except Homer's motive
    seems a bit far-fetched.  The Pete Porter gag was useless to the
    plot, and "not your idea" was not only the best line in the show, it
    showed Homer on a cognitive level he doesn't usually reach.  Despite
    the dearth of humor, I give it a B.

Yours truly: Second-best show of the season behind "Lisa's Wedding".
    The characterization was stellar, the jokes were top-notch, and
    everyone has a plausible motive.  I don't see how part two can
    possibly be better.  Grade: A+.

> "Lisa Simpson is Comics Star"
  (from the NY Post, 25-Apr-95, typed in by Bill Walko)
===============================================================================
[Simpson comics] helps keep [Matt Groening] stoked about "The Simpsons"
as it completes its season, which will end Sunday, May 21, with a "Who
Shot Mr. Burns?" cliffhanger.

Groening indicates that "Simpson" producers have gone to [great]
extremes to preserve the mystery.  "We've got our misleads and fake
script pages -- even a little misleading animation," he says.

Anxious not to repeat some of the great missteps in cliffhangerdom,
Groening says, "I guarantee you it's not a dream."

Nor have the "Simpsons" producers imported a character they can
conveniently write off as the trigger-figure.

"It's a character on the show," Groening teases.  "I don't want to
exclude anyone.  I feel like Janet Reno."

While less-animated series have hit the creative wall by their fifth
years, Groening says "Simpsons" writers and producers have sketched out
a 1995-96 season that will maintain zaniness but revive emotional
undertones from earlier seasons.

Among the plot twists for next season: Homer's mother, is not, as we've
thought, dead.

Groening is uncertain whether there'll be anymore crossover visits with
former "Simpsons" producer Conan O'Brien.

Bart has made a cartoon visit to "Late Night" and Groening says he
hasn't been invited back to the real-life "Late Night" since his visit a
few months ago.

Says Groening, "I don't think Conan wanted to be reminded of his shady
past."

> "Tying the Knots and Twisting the Plots"
  (from Entertainment Weekly No. 274, 12-May-95, typed in by Bill Walko)
===============================================================================
A season finale offers many a character a chance to settle old scores --
or rack up new ones.  Nearly every citizen in Springfield, having long
suffered at the hands of the sinister nuclear power plant owner, becomes
a suspect when "The Simpsons" poses the question, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?"
"We advise you to tape it and go through it frame by frame, not unlike
the Zapruder film," says executive producer Dave Mirkin, "and see if you
can come up with a theory of who shot Mr. Burns and why."  The answer
won't be revealed until the September season premiere and elaborate
precautions have been taken to guard the secret.  "Simpsons" creator
Matt Groening says, "We planted some misleads along the animation
assembly line, so that even if someone sneaks a peek, they're in for a
rude surprise."  Mr. Burns does survive.  "Fortunately, he hasn't
learned anything from the experience of being near death, which I do
admire," says Harry Shearer, Burns' voice.  "It accords with my sense of
how people are.  You can shoot them and they don't even learn."

Willy the janitor is reading one of these at the start of the episode.
    Matthew Kurth opines, "This is a reference to the childrens'
    publication `Weekly Reader', a weekly digest of current events with
    review and other questions based on the reading."

>> Slant drilling

Brian Phillips says that slant drilling is hideously illegal in Texas,
    hence the joke about Burns advertising the fact that he's doing it
    on a sign with large letters.

>> "Feelin' Groovy"

Tony Hill writes, "`Feelin' Groovy,' also known as the `59th Street
    Bridge Song,' was written by Paul Simon for a Simon & Garfunkel
    album, "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme" in 1967."

>> Three o'clock

3:00 seems to be featured prominently in this episode:

    - The clock on the wall when Bart writes his punishment says 3:00.
    - The TV in Moe's bar features an ad for "Pardon My Zinger", which
      airs at 3:00; also, Smithers watches "Pardon My Zinger".
    - Burns says the sun will set at 3:00.
    - The clock bell rings 3:00 when Burns gets shot.

>> Where is Springfield?

Tony Hill notes, "The fact that the school apparently had the mineral
    rights suggests it's not in one of the states which once belonged to
    Mexico, since in those states, the mineral rights belong to the
    state."  Also, "The game `Monopoly' [which Burns refers to] is set
    in Atlantic City, New Jersey."  Lastly, "Grampa seemed to know
    intuitively 1) that an earthquake was in progress and 2) to go into
    the doorway.  This suggests that Springfield is along the Pacific
    Rim, or perhaps in southeastern Missouri."

         rank.

 Skinner: [makes awkward noises of protest]

Chalmers: Uh, what's that say under your hand there?
 Skinner: Hmm?  Oh, it's an unrelated article.
Chalmers: It's an unrelated article?
 Skinner: [nodding] Mm hmm.
Chalmers: Within the banner headline?
 Skinner: Yes.  [puts the newspaper down] Now, to redirect our
          conversation slightly, I had a few ideas on how to spend this
          oil money.
Chalmers: Well, we could give each student a full college scholarship.
           [both burst out laughing]
 Skinner: Oh, mercy.  Seriously though...
-- No 78th-grade readers yet, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Skinner: Before we draw up the budget, I believe the students and
         faculty have a few suggestions.
  Willy: I want a crystal bucket for my slopwater and a brand new filthy
         blanket.

   Lisa: He's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo
         circuit and settle into a nice teaching job.
   Tito: Man, it will be my pleasure.  Lisa has told me all your

 Skinner: That's odd.  I don't have a secretary...or an intercom!  But
          send him in.
           [Burns enters dressed like Jimbo]
   Burns: Ahoy, there, Dean.  I understand you're taking suggestions
          from students, eh?
           [sits on desk; groans as his knee bends painfully]
          Well, me and my fourth form chums think it would be quite
          corking if you'd sign over your oil well to the local energy
          concern.
 Skinner: [clears throat] Mr. Burns?
   Burns: Buh!
 Skinner: It _was_ naive of you think I would mistake this town's most
          prominent 104- year-old man for one of my elementary school
          students.
-- Burns tries his hand at skulduggery, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

          maintain!  I own the electric company, and the water works --
          plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue!
 Skinner: That hotel's a dump and your monopoly's pathetic.  This
          school's oil well is not for sale, particularly to a
          blackhearted scoundrel like yourself.
   Burns: I see.  Then I'll just have to...attack you!
           [he flails like a sissy at the unflinching Skinner]
          I must have that oil.  [pants] Smithers...Smithers, help me
          subdue [pant] this beast.
Smithers: [walking in] Sorry sir, this was all I could find.
           ["fires" a stapler at Skinner]

% At dinner, the Simpsons discuss the news.

Marge: I'm happy for the school.  It sounds like this money's going to
       provide a lot of new opportunities.
 Bart: Big deal.  They didn't approve my idea; they said it was
       unfeasible.
 Lisa: It _is_ unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart.  And even if the
       Three Stooges _were_ alive I doubt they'd want to hang around
       with you.
 Bart: Oh yeah.  I guess they'd probably want to be with their families
       or something, huh?
Homer: Oh, I hate my job.  I mean, what's the point when your boss
       doesn't even remember your name?
Marge: I have an idea.
Homer: What?  What's your idea?
Marge: When my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent
       her a box of candy with his photo in it.  After that, she never
       forgot him.
Homer: That's all well and good, but it's not really _your_ idea, is it
       now, Marge?
-- Homer characteristically misses the point, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part

% Burns watches the work on the oil well proceed through binoculars.

   Burns: That's it.  Fumble about with your widgets and do-bobs.  It
          will all be a monument to futility when my plan comes to
          fruition.
           [looks through binoculars at his own drilling site: "Burns
          Construction Co.  Building a better tomorrow...for him"]
Smithers: Sir...[sighs] What I am about to say violates every
          sycophantic urge in my body, but I wish you would reconsider.
          This isn't a rival company your battling with: it's a school.
          People won't stand for it.
   Burns: Pish posh, it will be like taking candy from a baby.
           [sees a baby with some candy through the binoculars] Say,
          that sounds like a larf.  Let's try it right now.
-- A regular laff riot, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

Smithers: Er, um, there's some candy right here, Sir.  [points to a box]
          Why don't we eat this instead of stealing?
   Burns: Oh, very well.
           [they open it and start eating; a photo is slowly uncovered]
Smithers: Now look, there's a photo in here.
   Burns: Ah yes, I believe that's little Maggie Simpson, the baby who
          found my precious teddy bear Bobo.  Oh, and that Simpson mutt,
          my former guard dog.  Oh and um, that's uh, Bart Simpson, he
          was my heir for a brief period, you know?
Smithers: Yes sir, I remember.
           [later, they both look ill]
   Burns: Anything left?
Smithers: Uh, only the sour quince log, sir.
           [the log covers Homer's face]
   Burns: Ew!  Dispose of it.  And, uh, send a thank you note to Marge,
          Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.

% A dedication ceremony takes place at Springfield Elementary.  Skinner
% stands at a podium in front of a crowd of parents and children.

Skinner: Today Springfield Elementary embarks on a new era: an era of
         unbridled spending where petrodollars will fuel our wildest
         educational fantasies.  These young minds will enjoy every
         academic advantage [chuckles] till they enter Springfield High
         School, which has no oil well.
    Kid: [from audience] We got an air hockey table!
Skinner: Fine.  Now to switch on our oil pump for the very first time,
         here's our top student, Lisa Simpson.
Kearney: [from audience] Nerd!

       Oh, you're a dead man, Burns.  Oh, you're dead!  You're dead,
       Burns!
-- Homer gets serious, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

% Because of the damage to the Springfield Retirement Castle, Abe moves
% into the Simpson home.  Bart helps him unpack his suitcase when SLH
% rolls by on his cart.

  Abe: Hey, the lamp's running away!
 Bart: That's my dog, man!
  Abe: So long, lamp.  Now stop loafing and help your Grampa unpack.
        [Bart pulls out a cigar box and opens the top]
 Bart: [seeing a gun] Wow!
  Abe: That's my old Smith and Wesson.  If you're gonna play with it, be
       careful, 'cause its loaded.
Marge: [walking in] Aah!  Bart, put that down!  Guns are very dangerous
       and I won't have them in this house.
        [takes it away]
  Abe: How can you have a house without a gun?  What if a bear came
       through that door?
Marge: I'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to
       it.  [walks out]
  Abe: Geesh!  You should have fired into the air.  She would have run
       off!
-- Abe, ever practical, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

% The meeting at the town hall features Diamond Joe at a podium
% surrounded by his bodyguards.

  Quimby: People, take it easy.  We're all upset about Mr. Burns' plan
          to, uh, block out our sun.  It is time for decisive action.  I
          have here a polite but firm letter to Mr. Burns' underlings,
          who with some cajoling, will pass it along to him or at least
          give him the gist of it.
    Aide: [whispering] Sir, a lot of people are stroking guns.
  Quimby: Also it has been brought to my attention that a number of you
          are stroking guns.  Therefore I will step aside and open up
          the floor.
           [Smithers, unshaven and drunk, stands up]
Smithers: [crying] Mr. Burns was the closest thing I ever had to...a
          friend.  But he fired me!  And now I spend my days drinking
          cheap scotch and watching Comedy Central!
 Hibbert: Oh, dear God!
Smithers: {Ehh, it's not that bad.  I never miss "Pardon My Zinger".}
          {[Ned wraps a blanket around him]}
-- Weekdays at three p.m., "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

  Willy: {Burns cost me my groundskeeping job at the school.  And I'm
         too superstitious to take the one at the cemetery.}
    Abe: {Because of him, I lost my room, my things and my buddy's
         collection of old sunbathing magazines.}
Old man: {You bastard!}
    Moe: I lost my bar!
 Barney: I lost his bar!
   Lisa: He robbed the school of music!
Skinner: He robbed the school of financial security!
   Tito: He robbed the school of Tito!
  Homer: He can't remember my name!
  Marge: He's causing us all to yell!  [Maggie sucks violently]
   Bart: Look what he did to my best friend!
          [camera pans to Milhouse eating cheezies]
         No, my dog!
          [SLH rolls in on his cart]
  Burns: [chuckling] Oh, those wheels are squeaking a bit.  Perhaps I
         can sell him a little oil?
-- Uncalled-for jokes, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

% SLH growls at him.

      Bart: You twisted old monster!
             [runs at him; Burns pulls back his lapel and shows a gun]
     Burns: [scolds] I've decided to protect myself ever since I was
            attacked in my office by an unidentified assailant.
     Homer: D'oh!
McAllister: Arr.  Burns, your scurvy schemes will earn ye a one way
            passage to the boneyard...
       Ned: I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel.
       Mel: I'll see to it that Mr. Burns suffers the infernal
            machinations of hell's grim tyrant.  [flicks a switchblade]
      Otto: Yeah!
     Burns: Oh, you all talk big.  But who here has the guts to stop me?
             [camera pans across still audience]
            Mm hm.  Very well.  One last question: have you ever seen
            the sun set...at three p.m.?
McAllister: Aye, once.  When I was sailing 'round the arctic --
     Burns: Shut up, you!
-- Burns' diabolical plan unfolds, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

% "Take one last look at the sun, Springfield!" he exhorts, pressing a
% button on a remote control.  A giant shield lifts out of a mountain
% and blocks out the sun.  Burns laughs uncontrollably as it does so.
% Krusty runs up the steps to the town hall in shorts with a suitcase
% and does his trademark laugh.  "I've been in Reno for six weeks.  Did
% I miss anything?"  When he sees everyone looking aghast, he turns
% around.  Everyone starts leaving in the gloom.

Doris: Eternal darkness.  Well, that's just great.
  Apu: Listen, someone's got to get that Mr. Burns.  Where is that gun-
       toting lowlife when you need one?
Snake: Sorry, I was in the can.
-- Even criminals have to go, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

% Burns walks down the street and sighs, "Perpetual twilight, bathed in
% the glow of Burns brand electricity."  He jumps onto a lamppost and
% rhymes, "Hello, lamppost.  Whatcha knowin'?  I've come to watch
% your...power flowin'."
%
% Back at the town hall, Carl reaches for a jacket.  "That's odd," he
% remarks, "Mr. Smithers left his jacket behind."  The camera cuts back
% to an overhead view of Mr. Burns walking down the street and
% whistling.
%
% Otto, still in the Town Hall, observes, "Whoa, that's odd.  Principal
% Skinner left his mother behind."  Burns walks past a park bench
% humming.
%
% Marge loads Maggie into the station wagon.  She looks around: "That's
% odd.  Where's Homer?  And Bart?  And Lisa?  And Grampa?"  Mr. Burns is
% humming and walking down yet another street.  The camera cuts to the
% Simpson yard where the gun box sits open and empty atop a pile of
% dirt.
%
% Burns says to himself, "After all these years, things are finally
% starting to go my way.  I feel like celebrating."  He walks past the
% corner of a building; only his shadow is visible.  Suddenly, he stops
% walking.  Burns says, "I -- oh, it's you.  What are you so happy
% about?...I see.  I think you'd better drop it.  I said, drop it!"
% Some noises of Burns struggling are heard, after which he says, "Get
% your hands off!"
%
% The camera cuts back to Marge who asks, "Where is everybody?"  A
% gunshot is heard.  Burns stumbles from around a corner, gasping, a
% bullet wound on the left side of his chest.  Jimbo asks him, "Hey,
% man, are you OK?"  Burns stammers, "I won't dignify that with a
% response," then collapses on the sundial.

  Selma: Mr. Burns has been shot.
 Wiggum: Just a minute!  This isn't Mr. Burns at all!  It's a mask!
          [pulls at his face a little]
         Wait, it _is_ Burns.  Heh, his wrinkly skin, it...looks like a
         mask.
  Marge: I don't think we'll ever know who did this.  Everyone in town's
         a suspect.
Hibbert: Heh heh heh.  Well, I couldn't possibly solve this mystery.
         Can..._you_?  [points at camera]
          [camera pulls back to reveal that he's pointing at Wiggum]
 Wiggum: Yeah, I'll give it a shot, I mean, you know, it's my job,
         right?
-- To be continued, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:01]
%
% The music over the closing credits is somber and serious, the melody
% played by a single trumpet a la Taps (over a military drum beat).  A
% shot is heard during the Gracie Films music.
