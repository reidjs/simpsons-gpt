Lunch Lady Doris does a _good_ job of roasting the pig.  {bl}

The esquilax banner changed pictures between scenes.  {bl}

Lisa didn't start out with her name tag.  {dh}

Lisa's name tag disappears.  {bl}

The shadow of the fortune teller's hand doesn't change position while
her hand moves around, right before the flash forward scene.  {bl}

Lisa is in second grade in 1995, so she graduates High School in 2005,

there in 2010, unless she's in graduate school.  {ddg}

Lisa has her shoes off while the fireworks are going off, but has them
on again while embracing Hugh after his proposal.  {bl}

Why wasn't the satellite dish on the building being demolished by Bart
salvaged?  {ddg}

If Lisa and Hugh really did fly into Washinton National Airport, this is
an error because it's not an international airport -- overseas planes

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Tony Brower: If any of the Simpsons' writers read this, tonights episode
    was one of the best ever.  You guys really do the best work on US
    television.

Christine Tiplady: This episode RULED.  It WHALED.  First of all, it
    featured Lisa.  MOST of all, the family was realistic, well-
    intentioned, natural, imperfect; NOT stupid, caricatured, unfunny.
    I'm thrilled to death with this episode like I haven't been thrilled
    by a Simpson in ages.

Dave Hall: Despite some minor nonsense, I like this episode.  One thing
    that kinda bugged me (and others who were watching this episode with
    me) is that adult Lisa "seems" too tall.  I love teenage Maggie,
    though.  :)

Evan Eisenberg: Well, I have to say when the writers are on, they are
    on.  That was an incredible episode.  Wiggum cracked me up with the
    two headed dog with only one head.  The whole Maggie thing was
    absolutely hysterical, and I hope people will finally shut up about
    killing off Lisa...she was great.

John H. Woo: I must heartily concur with all those who liked this
    episode.  I especially liked the "hellion" Maggie, the "company
    eating rules", the Star Trek and Jetsons noises, Bart's adult
    Homerish look, the rotary videophone...Wow, this list could go on
    and on.  Once again, A+ from me.

Tarisha Dolyniuk: Lisa's Wedding was the best episode since "Last Exit
    to Springfield".  Everything was great except for the pull my finger
    thing.  I hope it will keep all the I-hate-the-writers people quiet
    for at least a week.

Tony Hill: This episode was an all-around laugh riot.  The flash-forward
    was packed end to end with side-splitting scenes.  Mandy Patinkin
    actually appeared in something funny!  We even got a glimpse of what
    might be in store for Maggie.  (Too bad they couldn't find a grown-
    up version of Liz to do the voice.)  A solid A!

Scott Hollifield: This was not only the best episode of the season
    (rivaling if not surpassing "Itchy & Scratchy Land"), but it's one
    of the best Simpsons period.  Loads of hysterical humor, of both
    traditional Simpsons and surreal flavors, plus a real, warm-hearted
    story focusing on the show's most well-rounded character.

Jeremy Osborne: I thought tonight's episode was definitely not the best,
    but it was still pretty decent.  I think they could have come up
    with something creative for Flanders to do in the future, but other
    than his absence from the year 2010, the characters had me in
    stitches as usual.

Travers Naran: All and all, this was an EXCELLENT episode.  From a
    purely dramatic and writing point of view (me being an amateur
    writer), this episode was also a fine piece of television.  The end,
    after all that vicious humor, ended on such a believably happy note.
    Not too many other shows on TV can get away with that.

Aaron Varhola: An excellent combination of future-projection gags and
    touching interplay, especially between Homer and Lisa before the
    wedding.  The running gag with Maggie STILL not talking was
    hilarious, as was Bart's virtual bar fight and Marge's shot at Fox.
    A++; only this episode and "Lisa's Substitute" get a second plus.

Dan Nguyen: It was full of cliches and mediocrities.  There were very
    few moments in that episode that I laughed at.  This type of story
    had been done very many times before, and is getting quite old.
    Probably one of the most mediocre episodes I have ever seen (no
    episode ever goes below mediocrity).

Rob Clark: This episode was embarrassing to say the least.  Not funny.
    Not cute.  Not one redeeming moment.  The 1994/1995 season (for me)
    will be remembered as the year "The Simpsons" spawned only a handful
    of good episodes.  Let's hope 1995/1996 is kinder to its audience.

Rick Diamant: I enjoyed this one so much, I would love to see a spinoff
    featuring the Simpsons of the future, assuming they can figure out
    how to put Mr. Burns back together again.  It wouldn't be worth it
    without him.

Ellen Micheletti: This was the best episode this season and one of the
    best ever.  It was funny and it was touching without being maudlin.
    I loved the adult Bart, and teenage Maggie not being allowed to
    speak, had me in stitches.  This is one for the archives!

John J. Wood: Grade: A. There have been funnier episodes, but none more
    fascinating and its premise based on Lisa's love for Homer was truly
    touching.  A few nice surprises (Milhouse!), but everything was
    handled tastefully.  Kudos to Mandy Patinkin for his fine cameo.

Dominik Halas: This was definitely one of the best episodes all season.
    The references to the future (like "Pepsi presents Arithmetic") were
    simply brilliant.  The list of celebrities who were arrested was
    also wonderful.  Sideshow Ralph Wiggum kept me laughing the whole
    night.

Deana Weibel: I, too, thought this episode was great, far better than
    most of what has run this season.  As an avid attendee of
    Renaissance Fairs in younger days, I enjoyed the parody.  I _loved_
    the inclusion of the Death card being an OK card despite its
    appearance, and ADORED the Happy Squirrel card with its bad
    associations.

Dave Burbage: Couldn't leave the States without posting about this
    episode; was truly the best Simpsons' episode ever!  I concluded
    after watching it that it was probably the best television program
    I'd ever seen!  Completely brilliant.  No praise is too high.
    A++++.

Margaret Lee: Wow.  I cannot say enough good things about Fox Sunday
    night.  This is one of the best Simpsons in a while.  Of course, the
    future provides ample material, but still -- you just can't beat
    that Pepsi video classroom.

Elson Trinidad: Amazing: it's the first episode in a LOOOOOONG time in
    which the general consensus of the a.t.s. community liked.  No more
    "This episode sucked" vs. "This was the best episode".  It's nice to
    see this happen for a change.  All I could say is, "I loved it."

David Thompson: Last night's episode was among the most disappointing
    displays I've ever witnessed.  Everyone's already seen Back to the
    Future, guys.  We don't want the Simpsons version.

Don Del Grande: B-plus -- it's a much better episode when you realize
    that it isn't as much "the story of Lisa's first love" as it is
    "just a bunch of stuff that may or may not happen".  Even Lisa has a
    hard time swallowing the story -- something I didn't really realize
    the first time around.  (Still, no "I do" means no A.)

Christian Coli: Lisa's Wedding, in my opinion, was rather poor.  The
    plot didn't do anything for me, and the renderings of the Simpsons
    in the future made me very glad they don't age.  The whole Milhouse
    thing was totally implausible, as well as disgusting.  Grade: D+.

Scott Fujimoto: Beautiful.  This is easily the freshest episode I've
    seen in a LONG time.  The flash-forward device apparently gave the
    writers a lot of new material to work with.  What boosts this
    episode to "classic" is the fact that it goes directly to the heart
    of Lisa and of the Simpsons.  Grade: A+.

Yours truly: Surreal...and excellent!  The Simpsons at its wacky best.
    After a ton of flashback episodes and only brief glimpses into the
    future, a full future episode felt welcome.  Love those Star Trek
    sound effects, cryoBurns, Maggie not speaking, videophone joke...a
    definite A.

===============================================================================
> "Lisa's Wedding" as a Fairy Tale (written by Cameron Dixon)
===============================================================================
"Lisa's Wedding" is a fairy-tale about reality, in which the conventions
of the standard magical fairy-tale are skewered in standard Simpsons
style, only to be replaced by the discovery that a sense of magic can be
found in "prosaic" reality.

This idea is first proposed by the Fantastical Beastorium, where
"ordinary" animals are treated as if they were fantabulous beasts of
yore.  But Lisa doesn't need to see an esquilax; she takes joy from the
rabbit being a "simple" bunny.

We then pass through a magical-appearing wood to the fortune teller,
whose powers are never really determined; she seems to know things about
Lisa's family she couldn't normally know, and tells her story so
convincingly that Lisa finds herself standing outside the tent at the
end as if she had actually lived out the events in her future.  Yet the
fortune teller took Lisa's name from her nametag and is unable to vanish
mysteriously when the need arises.  Perhaps she's just a good
storyteller, and that's where the "magic" comes from.

Hugh's proposal via fireworks is meant to be extremely romantic, but it
fails due to dud fireworks.  He is forced to resort to showing Lisa a
cow with a proposal taped to its side; it's not the most romantic image
in the world, yet somehow it works, it *is* romantic.  (Almost
immediately, we're reminded that whenever an android shows sympathy or
sentimental emotions, their head explodes and melts.)

All these events lead up to what Lisa has significantly referred to as
her "dream wedding", where she learns that the genuine love felt between
her and her family is more authentic and worthwhile than the flashy
romanticism of Hugh, who can't see the depth of Homer's love for his
daughter and doesn't want to acknowledge Homer's existence.

The final shot of 23- year-old Lisa weeping before the tents brings to
mind the image of a fairy-tale princess, and the closing music is played
in a bittersweet medieval/Renaissance style, confirming that this was
indeed a fairy tale with an important message about experience and
innocence.  The romanticized cliches of the "knight on the white horse"
have been skewered, but Lisa ends up looking at reality with the same
wonder and innocence brought to fairy-tales, and finds it more
worthwhile.

===============================================================================
> "Lisa's Wedding" as closure to "Lisa's Substitute" (written by Scott
  Fujimoto)
===============================================================================
"Lisa's Wedding" is the perfect bookend to "Lisa's Substitute," giving
the latter a feeling of closure.

In "Lisa's Substitute," a rift develops between Lisa and Homer.  Lisa
feels emnity towards her father because of his uncaringness towards her
feelings and boorish ways -- two traits that are the opposite of Lisa's.
Mr. Bergstrom, on the other hand, is the perfect father (or, in a way,
partner) to Lisa: intelligent, kind, sensitive to her needs.  When Lisa
is forced to acknowledge that she can't go away with her teacher, that
she will always be a Simpson, she makes amends with Homer.  But the
ending is left open: Homer regains Lisa's love by acting goofy, not by
truly mending the rift.  Neither character achieves self-realization.

In "Lisa's Wedding," Lisa is once again presented with a perfect
partner: intelligent, cultured, kind, sensitive to her needs.  And just
as she becomes spiteful of Homer when he is contrasted with Mr.
Bergstrom, so too does she become embarrassed with her family when they
are contrasted to Hugh and his family.  She shares Hugh's disdain for
the Simpsons until the climax of the episode when Homer delivers the
beautiful short speech to her.  Lisa then sees Hugh wants the Lisa part
and not the Simpson part, and that she will always be both -- a fact
that is a strength, not a weakness.  Although the Parkfields might be a
perfect family, the Simpsons are ultimately a loving family.  When Lisa
sees this basic, often-forgotten truth, the tension within Lisa between
her gifts and her family comes to a resolution -- she achieves self-
realization, which provides closure to "Lisa's Substitute".  This is
manifested by her rejection of Hugh in the future and her new attitude
towards Homer in the present.

"Lisa's Wedding" also highlights a change in _Homer_ in the future.  In
the present, Homer is ignorant or contemptuous of Lisa's gifts: her
intelligence, her curiosity, her activism, her sax-playing.  This is the
cause of the rift in "Lisa's Substitute".  So in "Lisa's Wedding", his
speech (which is about how Lisa is the best thing to come from the
Simpson family and what a gift she is to him) illustrates Homer's
understanding of both Lisa and himself.  At last, he appreciates Lisa
for how special she is; the conflict between the two that opened in
"Lisa's Substitute" is resolved.

It is the resolution of Lisa and Homer's relationship and the
realization each comes to (of Homer that he has a wonderful daughter; of

excellent: the Simpsons has reached a pinnacle, and after watching it I

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Dr. Dre

Charles Kelly explains that he is "a very popular `gangsta' rapper named
    Dr. Dre.  His album `The Chronic' was released in 1992, and it
    contained hits such as `Dre Day,' `Let Me Ride,' and `Nuthin' But a
    'G' Thang.'  Dre's headed to the penitentiary soon (if he's not
    already there).  I seem to recall that he pled guilty to a lesser
    offense rather than stand trial on what he was charged with.
    
    His given name is Andre Young, and he founded the seminal rap group
    N.W.A.  (Niggaz with Attitude) along with `Easy E' Eric Wright and
    Ice Cube, among others, in the late 1980s.  The group broke up, and
    its members have gone on to greater success."

>> Airport identifications

Bob Yantosca observes, "When they went to England, they flew out of
    Boston/Logan airport, recognizable by its distinctive tower.  The
    Logan tower is 20 stories tall, and was the tallest airport tower in
    the world for a while (it may still be, I'm not sure.)  Logan is
    also the 10th busiest airport in the USA and 16th busiest in the
    world overall.  I know all this neat stuff about Logan because I
    live 0.8 miles from runway 22R.  In fact, we're on a hill, so we can
    see the entire airport from our back porch!"
    
    Aaron Varhola says the airport they fly into is the National Airport
    in Washington.

>> Maggie's pacifier around her neck

Aaron Varhola claims, "During the summer of 1990 in the U.S., the
    second-most-popular fad was to suck on a pacifier; usually it was on
    a string around one's neck.  I don't know if it was Maggie-inspired
    or not, but I'd like to think so.  :) (See the movie `Boyz n the
    Hood' for an example.)"

>> Celebrity arrestee list

One of the celebrities arrested is the artist formerly known as Prince.
    Tony Hill says of him, "Prince, a curious performer, announced in
    1993 he was changing his name to the unpronounceable symbol seen in
    Brockman's list.  Last year, he announced he was to be called The
    Artist Formerly Known As Prince, or TAFKAP for short."
    
    Also, "Son of Sam, The Serial Killer Formerly Known As David
    Berkowitz, wrought havoc in New York in 1977."

>> The Edison Project

Aaron Varhola explains, "Chris Whittle is an entrepreneur who tried a
    few years ago to put a syndicated television newscast, with mucho
    commercials, in public schools.  His new idea is the `Edison
    Project', a system of commercially-operated private schools with
    heavy corporate input (read: advertising all over the place).  The
    Pepsi math lesson is an obvious ref to this."
    
    Benjamin Dreyfus continues, "This Orwellian vision of the future is
    _not_ fiction -- this is reality.  Last month, my school did a
    `Motivational Media Assembly' that was sponsored by Pepsi.  This was
    on a big old video screen in the auditorium, with clips from recent
    movies (Forrest Gump, Speed, etc.), clips from the excrement that
    passes for music (Ace of Base), interspersed with sports figures,
    handicapped people, recovering alcoholics, etc., talking.  At the
    end, the screen said `Be young, have fun, drink Pepsi.'  The general
    message seemed to be `Don't drink alcohol, drink Pepsi!'  And the
    only reason they interrupted educational time for this was because
    Pepsi paid the school 5 trillion dollars or something."

>> The music played by Martin

The organ music, writes Tony Hill, is "`A Fifth of Beethoven,' based on
    the first theme from the first movement to Beethoven's Fifth
    Symphony.  It was a number one hit for Walter Murphy in the fall of
    1976."  Ken Cox adds, "He did several similar pieces including
    `Flight '76' (Rimsky-Korsakov's `Flight of the Bumblebee'), `Night
    on Disco Mountain' (Mussorgsky's `Night on Bald Mountain'), and
    `Toccata and Funk in D Minor' (Bach's `Tocatta and Fugue in D
    Minor').  Come to think of it, I believe the last piece _was_ used
    in the rock-opera version of Phantom that also came out in the 70's;
    I think there was a movie version with Paul Williams in the title
    role.  A couple of Murphy's works also made it into Saturday Night
    Fever."

       ...to wear those...things.
Homer: Aw.
-- Homer, not too perceptive, "Lisa's Wedding"

% {Bart wears a headset and gloves and mimes playing pool.  Another man,
% also wearing a headset and gloves, mimes throwing a dart.  He tosses
% it, and Bart reels forward.  "Ow!  Hey, watch those virtual darts.
% I'm trying to play virtual pool."  He swings his virtual cue and hits
% the man; the man grabs a virtual chair and breaks it on Bart.  The two
% fight some more until Moe calls, "Hey, hey!  No fighting in my bar,"
% and pushes a button which emits a high-pitched tone straight into
% their ears.  They writhe on the ground in pain.}

% That night, in bed, Marge watches TV.

Marge: You know, Fox turned into a hardcore sex channel so gradually, I
       didn't even notice.  Yeesh!  [turns TV off]
Homer: Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one
       roof.  I never realized how much I missed it!  Listen to the
       murmurs in the next room...the house is full of life again.
       [pounds on wall] Keep it down in there!
 Lisa: All right, Dad!  [sighs] I'm sorry I left you alone with Homer
       and Bart.
 Hugh: [weakly] No, no, honey: I had a fine time.
 Lisa: How did you get that gash on your forehead?
 Hugh: Oh, that was when we hid in the dumpster, after the fire alarm
       went off in the pornographic magazine warehouse.
 Lisa: Oh, you are so good to put up with all of this.
 Hugh: Oh, don't be silly, Lisa.  Everything's fine, really.  Now go to
       sleep: we have a _big_ day ahead of us tomorrow, a big, long day.
        [they kiss; Lisa turns over]
        [Hugh drums his fingers together apprehensively]
-- Trouble in fiance land, "Lisa's Wedding"

% The next day...

Marge: Lisa, I can't _believe_ it's your wedding day already.
 Lisa: Mom, I feel kind of funny wearing white.  I mean...Milhouse.
Marge: [dismissive] Oh, Milhouse doesn't count.
        [they both laugh]
 Lisa: OK, I've got something old, that's my pearl necklace, something
       new is the wedding dress, something borrowed is this antique
       brooch from Hugh's mother...now I just need something blue.
Marge: [cuts a lock of her hair] Here.
 Lisa: Oh, Mom, thanks.
        [they hug]
-- Gray as a mule since seventeen, "Lisa's Wedding"

% A tent has been set up for the wedding, the shadow of the power plant
% looming large in the background.  In a nearby stream, some horribly
% mutated fish hop out of the water.
%
% Lisa prepares herself in front of a mirror.

Bart: Wow, Lisa, looking at you makes me want to get married for a third
      time.  I met a really nice exotic dancer the other night at Hugh's
      bachelor party.
Lisa: Hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
Bart: We had one in his honor.
       [Lisa looks glum]
      _I_ had one in his honor.
       [Lisa continues to look glum]
       [abashed] I went to a strip club.
-- True confessions, "Lisa's Wedding"

% Hugh prepares to introduce Homer to his parents.

 Hugh: [sighs heavily] Well, here goes nothing.  Mum, Dad...meet Homer
       Simpson.
        [they exchange pleasantries]
Homer: [long pause] You know what's great about you English?
       "Octopussy".  Man, I must have seen that movie...twice!
 Hugh: [weakly] Yes...yes!  Well, that's not too bad.
-- Preparing for the worst, "Lisa's Wedding"

% {Patty and Selma walk into the tent past an older Mr. and Mrs.
% Flanders.}

   Patty: {Hey, Krabappel: if you get in the way of that bouquet, I'll
          stuff that sunhat down your neck.}
   Burns: [being wheeled in] Smithers, take me home!  I'm not fully
          defrosted.
Smithers: Nonsense!  Just sit down and rest for a moment.  There you go.
           [Burns' bottom half breaks off]
   Burns: Ow!
Smithers: Oh, no.  We've got a little situation here.
   Burns: I can't feel anything below my cummerbund.
-- The wedding guests arrive, "Lisa's Wedding"

% Homer checks on Lisa.

Homer: Ooh la la!
 Lisa: Hi, Dad.
Homer: You look great, sweetheart.
 Lisa: [abashed] Thanks.
Homer: Little Lisa, Lisa Simpson.  You know, I always felt you were the
       best thing my name ever got attached to.  Since the time you
       learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me.
 Lisa: Oh, Dad --
Homer: No, no, let me finish.  I just want you to know I've always been
       proud of you.  You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it
       all yourself.  You helped me understand my own wife better and
       taught me to be a better person, but you're also my daughter, and
       I don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you
       --
 Lisa: Dad, you're babbling.
Homer: See?  You're still helping me.
-- The joy of children, "Lisa's Wedding"

 Lisa: [noticing the cufflinks] Hey Dad, did you forget to give those
       cufflinks to Hugh?
Homer: Uh...no.
 Lisa: Well?
Homer: I found them on the nightstand this morning and...well, I guess
       they weren't his cup of tea.  Don't worry about it.
 Lisa: But you've been going on about these all week.  I'm sure he just
       forgot.
        [walks to where Hugh is preparing]
 Hugh: Lisa, we're not supposed to see each other before the wedding.
       It's tradition.
 Lisa: What about _my_ family's tradition?  [holds up cufflinks]
 Hugh: Surely you don't want me to wear those?  In front of my parents
       and their friends?
 Lisa: But you promised my Dad you would.
 Hugh: I was just humoring him, darling.  Actually, he frightens me a
       bit.
 Lisa: I know they look a little silly but his feelings will be hurt if
       you don't wear them.
 Hugh: [resigned] Fine.  [wears them]
-- The delicate issue of the cufflinks, "Lisa's Wedding"

Hugh: I must say, you were right.  This has been quite trying.  You
      know, I've attempted to enjoy your family on a personal level, on
      an ironic level, as a novelty, as camp, as kitsch, as cautionary
      example...nothing works.  Frankly, I'll be quite relieved when we
      get back to England and we won't have to deal with them.
Lisa: Are you saying we won't see my family again?
Hugh: Well, possibly your mother will come when the children are born.
Lisa: I can't believe I'm hearing this.  I don't want to cut my family
      out of my life.
Hugh: Really?  But Lisa, you're better than this place: you're like a
      flower that grew out of a pot of dirt.
Lisa: That's a horrible thing to say!
Hugh: Well, come on, _you_ complain about them more than anyone.
Lisa: Maybe, but I still love them!  And I don't think you understand
      that.
       [walks out, leaving the ring in Hugh's hand]
-- "Lisa's Wedding"

% Meanwhile, in the main tent...

   Lovejoy: And now, to sing "Amazing Grace", Miss Maggie Simpson.
   Hibbert: Heh heh, she's quite a hellion but she does have an
            incredible voice.
    Maggie: Ahem.  [breathes in]
      Hugh: [rushing in] Stop everything!  The wedding has been called
            off.
             [everyone gasps and chatters]
Nelson Sr.: Ha ha!
Nelson Jr.: Ha ha!
    Krusty: Ohh...
   Lovejoy: Uh, this is very sad news, and it never would have happened
            if the wedding had been inside the church with God instead
            of out here in the cheap showiness of nature.
     Doris: Who wants cake?
             [everyone stampedes for it]
-- A happy ending for some, "Lisa's Wedding"

% Lisa walks out past a line of guests, dejected, and into a nearby
% wood.  She weeps.  The scene fades back to young Lisa, who turns
% around to see the soothsayer in her tent.

Woman: The next day, Hugh goes back to England, and you never see him
       again.
 Lisa: Wow.  Now that I know all this, isn't there any way to change the
       future?
Woman: No...but try to look surprised.
 Lisa: I thought you said you'd tell me about my _true_ love.
Woman: Oh, you'll have a true love, but I specialize in foretelling the
       relationships where you get jerked around.
        [laughs manically; throws a smoke bomb and continues to laugh]
        [the smoke clears, and she's still sitting there]
-- Less-than-spectacular exits, "Lisa's Wedding"

% As Lisa walks out of the tent, the bunny (er, esquilax) hops into her
% arms.  She carries it back to Friar Wiggum's and puts it in its box.

Homer: Lisa, Lisa!  Where were you?  You missed the most incredible
       thing.
 Lisa: [grateful] Hi, Dad!  [hugs him]
Homer: I ate seven pounds of fudge!
 Lisa: Wow!
Homer: The man at the stand said it was a record.
 Lisa: Wow!  What else did you do, Dad?
Homer: I rode the teacups, then I got a little sick and I had to sit
       down.  But then, I rode them again...
-- All's well, "Lisa's Wedding"
