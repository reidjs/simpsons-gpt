=======================================================================

The syndicated version of this episode:
    does not contain the blackboard scene
    recycles the couch scene from 1F01.

=======================================================================
> Did you notice...
=======================================================================
   
Ricardo A. Lafaurie Jr.:   
   ... Lisa appeared magically from nowhere in the couch?
   ... the '70s cookie-cutter music while Bart played with the "Go-Go
       Ray"?
   ... the subtle humor in Barney's remark:
	 "Hey, that looks like Princess Di!"
	 "Oh wait, it's just a pile of rags!" i.e, tabloids? get it?
   ... Barney's dazed face after Homer gives him a thrashing?
   ... Lionel Hutz immediately assumed that the judge was male?
	 [Typical sexist attitude, then of course I'm a regular
	  poster to alt.feminism... go fig.]
   ... the woman revoking Homer's license is the female judge from
       1F19 and 3F01?
   ... Ruth Powers at the horrifying video showing? [She's a drunk
       driver?]
   ... Maggie only appears once in the entire episode? [When she gets
       Bart's cupcake]
   ... 4000 days makes it approximately 12 years since Ned drank?
   ... Ned held the bottlecap of his blackberry schnapps?
   ... Bart does a Bart-twitch when he says "Sweet cakes for all"?
   ... Lisa thinks with incorrect grammar?
   ... Bart proved Lisa's science experiment correct by proving that
       hamsters can fly planes?
   ... when Homer crosses off his final dry day, his hand quivers?
   ... Homer and Marge's ever-expanding shadows as they bike into the
       sunset?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Ralph seems to have put together a pretty decent science fair
       exhibit?
   ... Homer's travails took place on a month with exactly 30 days?

Juha Terho:
   ... how Marge flipped the pancake?
   ... radiation signs everywhere in the plant?
   ... the ID card on the dead worker in sector 7-B?
   ... Duff, Duff Lite and Duff Dry all come from the same pipe? (Duh.)
   ... Barney probably looked up Phil's name from his ID card?
   ... Homer actually says "gulp" instead of gulping?
   ... Bart and Lisa don't carry schoolbooks with them?  (With the
       exception of the math book Lisa fetched, of course.)
   ... how the motorbike cops drove in formation?
   ... how Hans Moleman is shown to us at the meeting (look carefully
       how the camera pans to others and then him)?
   ... Lisa writes <very> fast?
   ... the liquor store guy looks at his watch?
   ... the freeze-frame joke about Jon Vitti, a Simpsons writer?
   ... how the real science fair ended just like Bart dreamed?
   ... Homer's calendar had no month marked on it?  The month had 30
       days and the first day was Tuesday.

Dave Hall:
   ... Marge wasn't wearing her `trademark' bunny slippers in this
       episode?
   ... Bart appeared to be ready to eat Lisa's mutant tomato for
       breakfast?
   ... the droning sound the marching employees made?
   ... the animal-like sounds in Sector 7-B?
   ... Homer didn't know a single Bible verse?
   ... the rock bounced off the spider?
   ... Homer jumped out of a window that was already smashed?
   ... Homer jump without looking?
   ... Homer bounce off the pavement?
   ... Lisa held her mutant tomato upside down?
   ... Skinner was in shock after being hit with the mutant tomato?
   ... Bart wasn't punished for the tomato incident?
   ... Duff, Duff Lite, and Duff Dry all came from the same pipe?
   ... Homer succeeded in preventing Barney from driving, but probably
       gave him brain damage, too?
   ... Chief Wiggum carelessly leaned on his gun?
   ... Lisa's hamster was sitting in a chair in Lisa's doll house?
   ... during the film, a man swallowed his own vomit?
   ... in Ned's flashback, Ned actually staggered into bed?
   ... Marge pating Homer's hand in coating him to give up beer for a
       month?  (cf. 7F22) [and 7G08 -ed]
   ... the impatient clerk in Homer's flashback?
   ... young Homer presented the ID without being asked?
   ... OFF rolls their toilet paper away from the wall?
   ... the tiny footprint on young Homer's T-shirt?
   ... young Homer was drinking two beers at once?
   ... Bart dropped Lisa's hamster?
   ... Nelson's small arsenal of `squirrel' wasting weapons?
   ... the squirrel-head trophy at Nelson's booth?
   ... Nelson is a bad shot?
   ... Bart got 1st prize without proving the merit of his science
       project?  (Can Hamsters fly airplanes?)
   ... Homer used a Duff Beer calendar to mark the days he didn't
       drink?
   ... it seemed so strange for Homer to hold a glass of lemonade?
   ... Barney was drinking for both Homer and him at the ball game?
   ... Homer was the only male at P&S's supperware party?

=======================================================================
> Comments and other observations
=======================================================================

>> "A Clockwork Orange" referenced [courtesy of Jose Lafaurie]

   With yet more scenes connecting Bart to the malchik Alex, in
   "Duffless" it evidently parodies it further.

   In the movie, Alex is arrested after his "drogues" betray him
   and agrees to an experiment which will let him free.  The
   experiment involves strapping him to a chair and making him
   watch films with distrubing amounts of "ultra-violence" and
   "in-out" (the 8F17 reference) which soon makes Alex revolted
   by these things.

   After his treatment, the doctors show him off in a press
   conference, demonstrating by having a man insult Alex and
   making him lick his boot.  And showing a bare-chested woman.
   Alex tried to reach for her breasts, but soon the behavioral
   correction set in and he curled up, gagging.

   Bart reaching for the cupcakes was shot for shot from Kubrick's
   film, (except that Bart shuddered instead of gagged, which IMHO
   would have been funnier) on top of the fact that Lisa's
   experiment caused a "behavioral correction" to Bart.

   BTW, I highly recommend you watch "A Clockwork Orange".  It's
   chock full of laps and lashes of ultra-violence that will make
   the hair on your plot stand on end!  (Hee hee.)

>> "Half B.F. Skinner and half P.T. Barnum"

   P.T. Barnum is (was?) one half of the famous duo Barnum & Bailey
   Circus.  B.F. Skinner was a famous psychologist, inventor of the
   controversial Skinner box, where he kept a human in an isolated
   box for a period of time (feeding him, of course) to see its effects
   on humans.  (This was also parodied in 7F17)

>> Lisa and Herman's Head

   In "Herman's Head", Yeardley Smith was an assistant to the main
   character.  Her name was Louise.

Juha Terho relates another joke of the same nature on Herman's Head:
    "In one scene in some episode, Louise, played by Yeardley Smith,
    the voicer of Lisa, asked, `Do you think I sou0nd like that Lisa
    Simpson character on TV?'

>> Kipp Lennon?

   He also appeared in 7F24, though I am unsure of his role (perhaps
   he ghosted for MJ's singing?).  Might he be related to John
   Lennon?

>> Recycled animation

Juha Terho observes, "The scene of the softball players is stolen
    from 7F05.  . . . The shot of Homer saying "D'oh" after he's
    arrested is clearly from some first or second season show, I'm
    just not sure which one."

>> Audio changes

Juha Terho tells us, "When the tour guide is presenting the second
    TV commercial, he says:  "We're proud of all our Duff Beer
    commercials, but here's a very special one from 1960."  Watch
    closely the mouth movement and the audio.  The lip sync is totally
    off!  Any lip-readers out there?"

>> Anabolic steroids wiping out world hunger

Juha Terho says, "The thing that makes the anabolic steroid joke
    funny is that Lisa says that the tomato could wipe out world
    hunger.  Actually, anabolic steroids can make you sterile.
    (Perhaps Lisa was right!  Less people, less hunger.)"

>> Potatoe

Juha Terho observes the multiple references of "potato(e)".  "Remember
    how Bart's science experiment in 7F08 was `still just a potatoe'?
    [it appeared again in 8F24 -ed]  And the extra blackboard of 7F01
    shown only on the third airing of the episode in USA?  `It's
    potato, not potatoe".

    Now, Bart's new science experiment (in his dream) says `Mashed
    potato'.  Way to go, Bart!"

Juha Terho says, "Brian McGee's age was 26 (why on Earth was the age
    on the I.D. card if there was a date of birth, too?) and he was
    born on August 2, 1948.  1948+26 equals 1974.  If Homer was 17...
    1974-17 equals 1957, which would be the year of Homer's birth.
    In 7F02, it was 1955 and in this episode in Homer's drivers
    licence, it is 1956.  They just can't decide.

    "Homer's age in the present time has always been 36 (in 9F02,
    for example).  1957+36 equals 1993.  Well, at least that is
    correct, according to the first airing of this episode."

>> The age of the power plant

Juha Terho observes, "The ancient map and the skeleton leave me
    wondering how old the plant is.  First, nuclear plants are not
    older than 50 years.  Secondly, in 7F12, we see that the power
    plant is not there yet, as Homer talks with his counselor.  `A
    new power plant is opening here soon...' And that happened in the
    year 1974.

    "But when we think about it, how is it possible that Jack Marley,
    as Burns said, has provided "45 years of faithful service" at
    the plant in 9F05?  (I know, Burns' recollection of years is not
    too good.  In 7F02, he says that he is 81 years old, and still,
    he flashbacks to the year 1909 in 9F15.)"

>> Strychnine

Juha Terho says strychnine is an extremely poisonous alkaloid.  Causes
    convulsions.  "(Mmm... shrimp.)"

>> Simpsons' address

Jose Lafaurie notes that this is an inconsistency with many episodes.
    "Blood Feud" and "Bart the Lover" gave the address as 94 Evergreen
    Terrace (no state), while "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" gave the
    address as 59 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield, TA (which there is
    no such state.)"

    "New Kid on the Block" gave the address as 1094 Evergreen Terrace,
    which is a little closer to the one given here.  The address given
    in "Kamp Krusty", 430 Spalding Way, didn't even give the same
    street name (though many note that this is a reference to a not-
    so-popular actor Spalding Gray).

    Also, according to "Homer's Triple Bypass", Snake lives at 742
    Evergreen Terrace.  And unless the Simpsons are taking in another
    surrogate neighbor (and I doubt after the Otto experience they'd
    want to do such a thing) they could not live there.

Others note that the state is NT.  There is no such state, but it is
    the postal abbreviation for Northern Territory in Australia.
    However, it's not populated enough.  (There is an interesting
    hypothesis in Dave Hall's "Where is Springfield?" List about
    this, though.)

However, Matt Groening had the final say.  He said that the Simpson's
    address is indeed 742 Evergreen Terrace, being in honor of the
    street he grew up in as a kid.  As for Springfield, that remains
    an enigma best left unanswered.

>> Hans Moleman

Jose Lafaurie also notes that in "Selma's Choice", Hans' birthdate
    was given as August 2, 1961, which is around 31 years old.  "Whew.
    When I saw it on Selma's Choice it gave me kind of a shock!"

>> Miscellaneous ref

Amos and Andy... the most racist show in town.

=======================================================================
> Reviews
=======================================================================
Juha Terho (still just a tomatoe):

	Pros:  * Uses big words.
	       * Dislikes the boy.
	       * Well-groomed.
	       * Tons of great lines.

	Cons:  * Technically more than poor.
	       * Bart's stupidity is totally out of character for him.
	       * Unrealistic at places, and somehow `empty'.
	       * Not "Duffless".  "Plotless".
	       * Possible Homer Sexual.

	No grade for this one.

Benjamin Robinson - The Lisa vs. Bart subplot was kind of superfluous
    (and the ending a bit contrived), but this was a solid episode 
    overall.  Homer's struggle with temptation was hilarious, and I 
    loved the tour of the Duff Brewery.

Yours Truly - This is one of the few episodes that earns an A+ in my
    book. True classic form, from Bart wrecking Lisa's project to Homer
    getting off the Duff to Lisa's experiment.  A subplot that didn't
    bite.  And a classic line: "What a terrible waste... Hi, I'm Troy
    McClure!"  And the hilarity of the supperware scene: "Don't be
    scared, Jub Jub... it's Mommy!", "I'd kill everyone..."
    "Duffless" is a classic.

% It's science fair time again!  Principal Skinner seems pleased with
% this year's crop of exhibits.

For a school with no Asian kids I think we put on a pretty darn good
science fair.
-- Principal Skinner, "Duffless"

% Skinner happens upon Bart's science project, a "Go-Go" Ray.  Bart
% demonstrates, and fires the ray, which is set on Mashed Potato, at
% Skinner.  Sure enough, he uncontrollably begins doing the Mashed
% Potato.  He sets the beam to "The Monkey" and zaps Ms. Krabappel.
% "Can't... stop... doing... the monkey!"

I'm disrupting the learning process, and I love it!
-- Skinner loves Bart's "Go-Go Ray", "Duffless"

% Skinner awards him first prize... first prize... first prize...
% The scene fades to reveal Bart is still in bed.

Lisa: [echoic from Bart's dream] First prize! First prize! First prize!
Bart: Why are you saying that?
Lisa: Just screwing with your mind.  [Laughs and runs off]
-- Sibling rivalry, "Duffless"

% Meanwhile, Homer and Marge prepare for another busy day.

Marge: [making up a batch of pancakes] Homer, I want you to encourage
       Lisa with her science fair project.
Homer: [pouring syrup on a newly minted stack of pancakes] Yeah, syrup
       is better than jelly.
-- Homer's own science project, "Duffless"

Lisa: [showing off a tomato the size of a beach ball] I've grown a
      futuristic tomato by fertilizing it with anabolic steroids.
Bart: The kind that help our Olympic athletes reach new peaks of
      excellence?
Lisa: The very same.

% Lisa imagines a 3rd world family cutting up and giving out slices
% of tomatoes freely, with a shrine devoted to Lisa.  Bart's science
% project investigates the effects of smoking on dogs, but Marge

        Homer: Well, time to go to work.
Homer's brain: Little do they know I'm ducking out early to take the
               Duff Brewery tour.
        Homer: Roll in at nine, punch out at five, that's the plan.
Homer's brain: Heh, heh, heh.  They don't suspect a thing.
                [camera pans down to Homer's mouth, but he doesn't say

Homer's brain: Uh, oh.  Did I say that or just think it?
        Homer: [panicky] I've got to think of a lie fast!
        Marge: Homer, are you going to the Duff Brewery?
        Homer: Aah! [Runs off]
-- Brain before mouth?, "Duffless"

% Homer rolls into the plant at nine.  The employees file cattle-like
% through the entrance.  When one hapless worker bends down to tie his
% shoe, the guard encourages him to move on with a well-aimed kick to
% the rear.  Homer reads a tattered map: "If the plant ye wish to flee,
% go sector 7-B." Homer ducks through the door to sector 7-B.  On the
% other side is a long, dark tunnel with many pipes running along the
% ceiling.  Moving intrepidly down the tunnel, Homer is started when he
% bumps into a skeleton.  Before he has much time to contemplate what
% fate befell that guy, a huge purple spider appears.  Homer consults
% his map: "To remove the spider's curse, simply quote a Bible verse."
% But he is stuck at "Thou shalt not..." and simply throws a rock at
% it, knocking it out, and leaps out the window.  Outside the plant,
% Barney waits for Homer in his car.  There is a mattress tied to the
% roof, presumably to cushion Homer's fall.

Hey!  That looks like Princess Di.
 [drives forward a few feet. Homer slams into the ground just behind
  the car]
Aw, wait, it's just a pile of rags.
-- Barney, "Duffless"

% Class at Springfield Elementary lets out for the day.  Lisa is still
% hauling around the tomato.

   Lisa: Oh Bart, I forgot my math book.  Could you hold this for me,
         please?
   Bart: [Curly-esque] Why, <sointantly>!  Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
          [takes the tomato from Lisa]
Skinner: [walks past Bart, then stops]  Whoops!  Shoe's untied.
          [bends over to tie it]
         Over, under, in and out, that's what shoe tying's all about.
-- "Duffless"

% Bart resists temptation -- for maybe two seconds.  Then he hurls the
% tomato at Skinner.  He looks up from his shoe-tying to see the tomato
% making a beeline for his bottom.  The scene goes into slow-motion as
% Skinner yells "Noooooooooooooooooo!".  The tomato hits its target,
% splattering free goo all over everyone.  Everyone laughs, except for
% a certain student who removes with her math book.  "BAAAART!"
%
% Homer and Barney make it to the Duff Brewery.  An automaton of a
% couch potato whirls out of the Duff Brewery clock and burps three
% times.  A tour guide greets Homer, Barney and other tourists.

   Guide: Welcome to the Duff Brewery.  Well, I'm sure that all of you

-- Great plan, Bart, "Duffless"

% It's science fair time!  (For real.)  Springfield's student body
% shows off the fruits of their scientific labor.

Milhouse: Behold gravity in all its glory!
           [pushes a Slinky down an inclined 2-by-4.  It goes one step,
           then stops]
    Edna: Pretty lame, Milhouse.
-- Milhouse's science project, "Duffless"

% {Milhouse isn't the only kid having problems.}

Chuck: {Can I touch it?}
  Dad: {I've worked too long and hard on this for you to screw it up
       now.}
Chuck: {But it's got my name on it.}
  Dad: {Just stand over there!
        [kid walks off screen]
       Over there!}
-- You can't enjoy it on as many levels as I can, "Duffless"

% {Martin tries his hand at scientific enlightenment.}

Martin: {Behold the flying machine that will car me, Phineas Fogg,
        around the world in eighty days.}
Nelson: {[shoots Martin's balloon] Dang!  I was aiming for his head.}
-- Martin Prince's science project, "Duffless"

% Homer spots Ralph Wiggum's exhibit:  A little alcohol-fueled car
% running on a circular track.  He's trying not to think about beer.
% He imagines himself at a gasohol pump, alternately pumping gasohol
% into his car and himself. "One for you, one for me.  One for you, one
% for me." BTR, Homer gives one of his lusty "Ohhhh"s (with the drool
% hanging out.)
%
% At Lisa's exhibit....

Marge: I don't know if I like you experimenting on your brother.
 Lisa: Please, mother, its purely in the interests of science.
        [thinking] That'll learn him to bust my tomater.
-- Revenge is a dish best served cold a la gazpacho, "Duffless"

% Lisa's revenge is interrupted the hub-bub surrounding one of the
% other exhibits.  She slips through the crowd to see the cause of all
% the fuss.  It is Bart, wearing a circus barker costume and standing
% in front of his exhibit.

Step right up, folks!  We'll answer the question that's been
plaguing scientists for ages:  Can hamsters fly planes?
-- Bart's science project, "The Simpsons"

% Bart reveals Lisa's hamster in WW I aviator goggles and scarf,
% sitting in a model plane.  The crowd "aww"s at its hideous cuteness.
% Lisa protests. "But this project has no scientific merit!"  The crowd
% tells her to take a hike.  "Sour grapes."

Every good scientist is half B. F. Skinner and half P. T.
Barnum.
-- Principal Skinner, on Bart's project, "Duffless"

% Without looking at any of the other exhibits, Skinner awards Bart's
% project first prize.
%
% Homer marks off his first alcohol-free day ("One down, 29 to go")
% and watches a little TV.  Unfortunately, it's one of the omnipresent
% Duff ads.  This one features a group of women leading an anti-sexism
% protest.  A pair of beer delivery men look on, bemused.

   Women: Down with sexism!  Down with sexism!
   Man 1: Look at all those feminists.
   Man 2: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
           [they both reach for bottles of beer, shake them up, and
          spray the foam on the protesters.  This magically turns
          them into bikini-clad party animals.  (Kids, don't try that
          at home.)]
Both Men: Yeah!  Yes!  All right!
-- A Duff Beer commercial, "Duffless"

TV, have you turned on me, too?
-- Homer, "Duffless"

% Homer tries to take his mind off his troubles at the ball park, where
% he is the only person in the stands not drinking.

Announcer: ...the windup and a 2-2 pitch.  Oh, no, wait a minute, the
           batter is calling for time.  Looks like he's going to get
           himself a new bat.  And now there's a beach ball on the
           field, and the balls boys are discussing which one of them's
           going to go get it.
    Homer: [only one not drinking] I never realized how boring this
           game is.
-- A rude awakening, "Duffless"

% At home, Homer marks his 15th dry day.  He notices he's lost weight.
% {Later, Homer attends Patty and Selma's home utensil party.}

Patty: {Thank you all for coming.  We've got some very interesting new
       developments in the field of Supperware.}
Selma: {Uh, huh.  This is the 128-ounce tub.  You can fit your whole
       head in it. [demonstrates and looks at Jub-Jub]  Don't be scared
       Jub-jub; it's momma.}
Homer: {[sotto voce] I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of
       sweet beer.}
-- "Duffless"

% Homer attends another Alc-Anon meeting.

Lovejoy: So Homer, pleas feel free to tell us anything.  There's no
         judgment here.
  Homer: The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the
         football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
Lovejoy: I cast thee out!
-- You remember Matthew 21:17, "Duffless"

% Homer rides along on Lisa's bike, trying not to think about beer.
% He sees a Duff billboard of a scantily clad woman next to a beer
% bottle ("You know you want it") and Homer turns sharply to avoid
% looking at it.  He stops at a railroad crossing, where he sees that
% the train rolling past is carrying several boxcars' worth of Duff.
% The wheels even seem to be saying "Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-
% lug"...  Homer turns away from the railroad and bikes straight into
% an empty can of Duff which sends him off his bike looking skyward.
% A zeppelin flies overhead, with a marquee reading "Surrender to Duff"
% and releases a payload of Duff Bottles. "Nooo!!!!"
%
% Despite all of that, he makes it.  Shuddering, Homer crosses off the
% last day of the month.

Homer: Thirty days.
Marge: I'm proud of you, Homey.
Homer: Marge, I'm going to Moe's.  Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm
       coming back loaded.  [kisses Marge good-bye]
-- "Duffless"

Marge: Mmmm.  You don't have to start drinking right away.  I waas
       thinking we could go for a bike ride.
Homer: But Marge, the barflies are expecting me.  Larry, and Barney,
       and that guy who calls me Bill.
Marge: But you look better, you don't sweat when you eat any more, and
       look -- [holds up a wad of cash] you've saved more than a
       hundred dollars.  I found it in your pants.
Homer: [snatches money] Yoink!
Marge: Mmmm.
-- "Duffless"

% Homer arrives at Moe's.

     Moe: Well, well.  Look who it is, Mr. "I Don't Need Alky-hol to
          Enjoy Life."  We hate him, right fellas?
Barflies: [grumble]
   Homer: Moe, give me a beer.
     Moe: Hey everybody, Homer's back.
Barflies: [grumbles]
-- Who cares?, "Duffless"

% Moe pours Homer a glass of that wonderful Duff.  Homer lifts it to
% his lips, but hesitates to drink it.  He eyes the poor, pathetic
% barflies around him: Larry, Smitty (collapsed), and Barney (who
% burps).  Then he looks at Moe.

   Moe: C'mon, Homer, do it for your old pal Moesy.
Barney: But Moe, yesterday you called Homer a worthless sack of --
   Moe: [strikes Barney] Pipe down, rub-a-dub!
-- Moe pushes Homer to get back to alkyholism, "Duffless"

 Homer: [setting the glass on the bar] Put it in the fridge Moe, I got
        a date with my wife.
   Moe: You'll be back!  [points at various customers] And so will you.
        And you.  [points at camera] And you.
         [he points at Barney]
Barney: Of course I'll be back.  If you didn't close, I'd never leave.
-- Moe fails to get Homer back to alkyholism, "Duffless"

% Homer and Marge go on that bike ride, after all.  They sing along to
% "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" as they bike into the sunset.

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21'11" {19'55"}]

% Instead of the usual closing theme music, "Raindrops Keep Falling on
% My Head" (as sung by Kipp Lennon) keeps playing.

      (instrumental continues for ~10 seconds)
     
     It won't be long before happiness steps up to greet me
       . . .
     Raindrops keep falling on my head
     But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
     Crying's not for me, 'cause
     I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
     Because I'm free, nothing's worrying me.

% The sound effect for the Gracie Films logo is replaced by a bicycle
% bell being rung twice, followed by Homer giggling.
