   ... Homer carries Marge (with both hands) up the ladder in the barn and

       the Hill"?

Daniel L. Dreibelbis:
   ... this is the first time Homer yelled "BART!" in that barking tone in a
       long time?

Jordan Eisenberg:
   ... Todd was beating his older brother in checkers?
   ... "Up, up and Buffet!" wasn't actually a buffet?  (Unless you've seen a
       buffet that served hamburgers)
   ... Lisa used a colander to hold the dirt she dug up?
   ... Chief Wiggum is much less tolerant of Marge and Homer's nudity than
       in 1F22?
   ... both this season and the last ended with the kids disappointed that
       they're not going somewhere?

Patrick Geahan:

   ... how close Homer and Marge came to sliding into the sign?

   ... Moe steals Mrs. Lovejoy's line?

Haynes Lee:
   ... Marge's tall curler rack?

Tom Rinschler:
   ... the oxygen masks dropping in the restaurant?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... this episode is rated TV-PG-DLS, the most restrictive the show has yet
       received?
   ... the restaurant captain mispronounces "Simpson" as "Sampson"?
   ... Marge covers herself when the Bed & Breakfast maid walks in, even
       though she isn't undressed?
   ... it's "blink and you miss it," but we twice see Marge's tush? (A
       "Simpsons" milestone:  This is the first time Marge -- or any other
       adult female on the show -- has mooned us)
   ... this is <really> "blink and you miss it," but Marge's breasts are

       featuring OFF appeared in the KOTH season finale?])?
   ... it's only the seventh episode this season to have an full opening?

> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
==============================================================================
= Maggie watches from the couch as Bart and Lisa play Hotwheels, but she's
  gone when the camera angle changes, then returns.

* The cake couldn't have been in the freezer for 11 years, as the Simpsons
  have only been living in their current house for about 8 years. {ad} [See
  next goof --hmw]

* In "A Milhouse Divided," (during the flashback) Homer and Marge's wedding
  cake was whale-shaped, and had no bride and groom. {nmd} [The bride and
  groom are probably from Homer and Marge's second wedding in the same episode
  --hmw]

* Homer has looked in the freezer many times. {th}

= From the way that the scene is animated when Homer comes down the stairs
  and slips on the water, the kitchen is where the front room normally is.
  {pg}

= There was far too much water from the freezer defrosting. {th}

= Homer says his tie's a clip-on, yet the tie looks like a conventional tie
  (part of the tie is seen under Homer's shirt collar) {ad}

* A green tree shouldn't catch fire like that [lightning strikes outside the
  barn --hmw]. {th}

= The pitchfork would obscure the sights of the shotgun. {th}

- After Homer and Marge "have fun" behind the curtain in the jigsaw room, when
  we see OFF's house the windows are greenish.

= There are more items in Bart and Lisa's haul when Homer and Marge enter.

* A piano wouldn't work with Hitler's body inside. {th}

= Maude's blue eye makeup disappears.

* Homer and Marge get most of the details right, but Bart was really conceived
  in the mini-golf course's castle, not the windmill.  Who can forget the
  line, "Don't worry Marge, this castle is impregnable!" {bjr}

= Ned Flanders is stood with Helen Lovejoy, but frames later he is stood with
  Chief Wiggum, without being seen moving. His putter also disappears.

= In the opening shot of Gil's car dealership, the balloon was stationed in
  the middle of the lot, fully inflated, with an advertisement taped to the
  side. I don't know much about hot air balloons, but my instincts tell me
  that if a balloon isn't operating or in flight, the balloon deflates. {je}

= There are two number 12s on the same team in the stadium.

= There were no cameras aloft where the flashes were coming from. {th}

= (I hate myself for including this, but) The animators couldn't seem to
  decide just what size Marge's chest is.  (If it were anyone else, this would
  be a minor nit.) {je}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Ben Collins: Despite the weird Simpsons-meets-South Park-meets-thirtysomething
   premise and lack of subtlety and a strong plot (or ending), this episode
   actually works on a certain level. Matt Selman's style is like a somewhat
   weaker adaptation of Oakley and Weinstein's pack-a-lot-of-gags-on-a-weak-
   story-and-make-the-episode-work [stop doing that! --hmw] formula. While
   this one didn't keep my mind going, it made me laugh out loud. (Grade: B)

Anthony Dean: After last week's episode, this week's offering was a
   disappointment, especially as a season finale. The subplot, along with the
   episode's third act, didn't seem to go anywhere, and I could've done
   without a joke referring to "Homer's Enemy"'s poor ending. (Grade: C-)

Nathan Mulac DeHoff: THIS was the episode that they chose to end the season?
   The rekindling of Homer and Marge's sex life has been done, and much more
   effectively and humorously, in "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy."  Some of
   the other jokes were recycled from previous episodes, too.  As for Homer
   and Marge trying to get home while naked, that just wasn't funny.  The
   subplot had potential.  I liked the pirate scene and the "killing spree
   ending" reel of "It's A Wonderful Life."  As it was, though, too little
   time was spent on the subplot, and, not having seen "Casablanca," the
   alternate ending didn't do all that much for me. (Grade: D)

Daniel L. Dreibelbis: Well, the season finale wasn't too bad, with a strong
   "A" plot and a much weaker "B" plot to drive it. The third act was
   definitely the  best with Marge and Homer's attempt to escape the
   authorities loaded with some excellent gags.  The "B" plot, alas, ended
   somewhat abruptly and tended to fall flat, although the alternate ending
   to Casablanca did have a few laughs. (Grade: B)

Jordan Eisenberg: A great end to a mediocre season.  For the first time in a
   while, I felt that the writers took full creative advantage of a situation,
   and were able to keep everything in character during the most unlikely
   situations.  I did feel that sex appeal played a big part, but the writing
   had enough real substance to accept it. (Grade: A-)

Patrick Geahan: Thouroughly enjoyable.  A good plot, with a so-so subplot,
   and a good ending.  Shows Marge and Homer as a normal couple, with normal
   problems.  Plenty of refs(Robert Schiller, the Clash) and smart humor,
   added with the fact that the nudity and the plot were semi revealing
   without being tasteless. (Grade: A)

Andrew Gill: Well, I'll have to admit, I'm a sucker for experimentalism.  I'm
   such a fan that I often overlook terrible plots, etc.  Maybe I ought to
   just abstain from reviewing the plot.  The rest, though, was pretty good.
   The entire episode was nominally off, but just within bounds of being a
   good ep. (Grade: A)

Tony Hill: This was a rip-roaring good episode with no downside.  The only
   thing that struck me as odd was Carl & Lenny's comments about Marge.  And
   why didn't Homer just throw the ball out?   This ep was good for a lot of
   laughs.  (I laughed hardest at the "Yablo" commercial for Sprite.) 
   Homer's lines "I don't think anything I've ever done is wrong" and "Why
   are people always trying to kill me" are instant OFF classics. (Grade: A)

Haynes Lee: A great ending to a dismal season. The Bart subplot was too minor
   and could have been dropped entirely without notice. (Grade: A)

Ondre Lombard: An exciting, hilarious, fresh and sexy episode which takes a
   wacky spin on Homer and Marge's romantic life.  One for the classics,
   except for the fact that the subplot seemed needless and didn't really
   contribute too much besides Bart and Lisa's presence and a bit of
   Hollywood satire. Without the subplot, an A, with it, the conclusive
   grade. (Grade: B+)

Michael K. Neylon: With regards to this episode, I found it to be one of the
   better episodes of this season, and strictly considering episodes produced
   for this season, the best one so far. This episode shows how OFF can offer
   slapstick/visual humor while still providing a strong plot (The subplot,
   eh...). It also shows some of the good flashback/throwaway scenes that OFF
   can be known for - the pirate scene, for example, was funny, as well as
   the alternate ending to Casablanca. This episode also helps show how Marge
   and Homer's married life beyond being parents is happening. This
   strengthed that they do really love each other, and was a subtle
   improvement on their characters. Only 3 major nits on this episodes.
   First, the reference to Frank Grimes. The subplot blew, basically. It had
   little to do with the main plot, and didn't end with anything worthwhile,
   or even with a solid end. The big nit I have is the joke that ended Act 2
   -- why did *ALL* the townspeople need to get involved in groping the
   couple through the windmill? This made no sense, but given how Act 3
   starts, it sorta makes hindsight sense -- however, it was still a poor
   crutch. But save for these nits, I'm really pleased with the end result of
   this episode, much better than the premise lead on to believe. This
   season, 9/10, and 8/10 on an overall basis. Not destined for classicness,
   but a good sign that the spark of the old OFF episodes are still there in
   the production crew.

Benjamin Robinson: It's not surprising that this episode had sexual innuendo
   to spare.  It's a little surprising how far this show goes.  It's really
   surprising that the show is about as good when everyone keeps their
   pant(ie)s on as when they bare it all.  The subplot, where Bart and Lisa
   search for buried treasure, is also good.  Funny instead of just smutty,
   "Natural Born Kissers" is a great way to wrap up the year.  Parental
   advisory:  This episode isn't as family-friendly as the typical "Simpsons"
   show -- proceed with caution. (Grade: A)

Matt Rose: A very silly episode. I laughed a lot. I will admit my perverted
   side did like seeing Marge and Homer running around naked; you had to love
   it when Homer stood in front of those two sawing figures where his
   you-know-what would be and when he covered himself with teacups.  I have
   never heard of Matt Selman; it seems like a lot of the better episodes this
   year were written by first timers. (Larry Doyle and Ned Goldreyer to name
   others...)  Encouraging for next year.  A couple nits:  I think the subplot
   in this episode was totally pointless except for the 'Casablanca' part. And
   Lisa should be able to tell the difference between a metal detector and a
   vacuum cleaner. And WHY did they have to mention Frank Grimes? Why remind
   us of an episode most of us would rather forget. Don't the writers know
   that the ending to that episode doesn't sit well with a lot of people?
   These events notwithstanding, I enjoyed pretty much everything else. Good
   characterization, an enjoyable plot, a decent ending (well..to the main
   plot anyway). The animation seemed different but OK. The voice-acting as
   usual was a treat to listen to; rarely does anyone seem to give them the
   credit they deserve.  As this season comes to a close, the show is back on
   somewhat of a roll after a dismal period near the middle of the year that
   I would call one of the series lowest points. For the first time in a long
   time, I've been excited about new Simpsons episodes again. (Grade: B+)

Donni Sapphire-Bernstein: A great season finale. I think we've all been a
   little curious about Homer and Marge's bedtime habits from time to time
   [uh, what? --hmw] and while this episode may tell us more than we want to
   know it's still quite interesting. Plus, practically every last joke was
   a bullseye. Grandpa and "Fatty Yellow Beans," Homer drunk on love and
   beer, and the people at the see-through cathedral will no doubt become
   permanent parts of the Simpsons canon of quotes. This episode showed once
   again the superior plot twists and conceits made possible through the use
   of cartoons, and there was practically nothing for me to gripe about. The
   only possible fault was that past getting caught in minitaure golf
   everything was hard to believe -- but so what? (Grade: A+)

Mike Smith: At least the alternate ending of "Casablanca" should've been
   longer, instead of giving so much HARDCORE NUDITY!!! That's the matter with
   subplots this season. not much subplots to settled down with! (Grade: A-)

Yours truly: I have mixed feelings about this one. While it's a very funny
   episode, with an appealing plot, I would prefer it if this episode had
   never happened. Running around town naked and having sex in public is a
   road I hoped the Simpsons would never go down. Such a ridiculous idea.
   (Grade: C-)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> What's the title?

There are two official titles for this episode. In the United States and most
   countries, "Natural Born Kissers" is used, but the episode is also known as
   "Margie, May I Sleep With Danger" in the United Kingdom and other
   countries.


>> Fun with promotion

Benjamin Robinson shares some amusing information: The person charged with
   putting together the radio promotion for this episode evidently didn't feel
   the episode was ribald enough, so he or she spiced up the dialog.  Marge's
   "I feel so naughty" line was juxtaposed with Bart's, "You guys are sick,"
   making it look like the Simpson children were in the know.


>> A guide to what they showed and what they didn't

Jordan Eisenberg seems to be the only person daring enough to come forward
   and admit he tracked down instances of strong nudity in the episode with
   the help of watching parts frame-by-frame: I counted three times Marge's
   breasts were exposed, and once (I'll have to check my tape on a higher
   resolution TV) I thought I saw a frame of Homer's, um ... doodle.  The
   first time is just as they leave the fallen windmill:  Marge wasn't facing
   forwards when she began running, and we got two frames of, as Benjamin
   Robinson put it, two close parenthesis ") )" before she faced away from us.
   The clearest example is in the balloon basket.  After Homer's line "The
   British tabloids will have a field day", he lets go of Marge to stand up
   and it takes five frames for her to cover herself up again.  From what we
   see, in addition to having four fingers, yellow skin and blue hair, the
   women of Springfield have no nipples.  After being dumped into the football
   stadium, Marge is shown one more time.  As she reaches for Homer, we get
   one frame with one breast (the right).  I'm not very intent on confirming
   this, but I think I saw Homer's hands slip for one frame as he runs from
   the fence to the tree.  When I freeze-framed it, it was mostly a blur.


>> "We're playing Hotwheels!"

Hotwheels are car-based toys. You can put together your own race tracks by
   clipping pieces (like Bart and Lisa were fighting with) together.


>> "And that's how I earned the Iron Cross!"

The Iron Cross (Eiserne Kreuz) was a military decoration, awarded for merits
   in the war. Instituted in Prussia in the 1800s, and to German soldiers of
   the First and Second World War about a hundred years later.


>> Dave Barry: American Badass

Daniel L. Dreibelbis: Dave Barry, the syndicated newspaper columnist and
   author whose looks at popular culture and daily life are riotously funny,
   and whose down-to-earth and silly approach to journalism would appeal
   perfectly to someone like Bart. A self-proclaimed expert on bad songs (his
   comments on Neil Diamond won him the continuing emnity of the balladeer's
   fans), Dave plays lead guitar in the Hard Rock Remainders, a rock group
   consisting of authors which includes Stephen King, Amy Tan and (surprise!)
   Matt Groening.


>> I knew we should've gone with, "Opaque Metal Catherdral"

Benjamin Robinson: There is a Crystal Cathedral -- it's an all-glass church
   out in California somewhere.  If I'm not mistaken, the Rev. Robert Schuller
   used to host a televangelism program from there, and might still to this
   day.  Also if I'm not mistaken, more that one "Crystal Cathedral" has been
   built, so the "Where is Springfield" folks probably shouldn't pin
   Springfield's location to close to Schuller's church.


>> Casablanca

Daniel L. Dreibelbis helps all of us who were staring blankly during the
   Casablanca alternate ending: If you've been hiding under a rock for the
   century, it's considered one of the greatest movies ever  made, with
   Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in a tale of missed opportunity and
   foreign intrigue set in World War II.


>> Alternate ending, eh?

Dale G. Abersold: No, they never filmed an alternative ending to
   "Casablanca." According to the Internet Movie Database
   (http://www.imdb.com), however, they had scheduled to film a second ending.
   However, the original ending worked so well, they didn't bother with a
   second one (in which, presumably, Ilse would end up staying with Rick).
   What do you mean, you've never seen "Casablanca"? Go see it today!


>> Damn you British tabloids!

Daniel L. Dreibelbis shares a little interesting information: Homer's
   disgusted comment about the British tabloids reporting on their scandal
   was inspired: Rupert Murdoch, who owns FOX Television, the network The
   Simpsons appears on in the U.S. (and who also owns SKY, the satellite
   station that shows the first-run episodes in the UK and Europe) happens to
   own London's The Sun, a tabloid notorious for printing scandal stories on
   the rich and famous with blaring front-page headlines and pictures, as
   well as moralizing about vice and promiscuity of the general public (a
   hypocritical stance, since the Sun is also notorious for printing
   pictures of topless models on Page 3).

   [There's also a tabloid in Britain called The Daily Sport, which is
   basically a whole newspaper full of Page 3s. They'd probably be the first
   to jump at the Homer/Marge story. --hmw]


>> Episode too racy?

Mike Scully spoke about this episode in an interview posted at dailyradar.com
   on 6th December, 2000. An extract follows.

   Direct Hit: Actually, you bring up a point that I was planning on asking
      you about. Has there ever been an instance where you guys really wanted
      to do an edgy story, but the network stepped in and simply said "no
      way"? 

   Mike Scully: Not really. But there was one time they looked at an early
      draft of a script and voiced some concern. It was a couple of years ago
      -- the episode where Homer and Marge struggle to rekindle some
      excitement for each other in the bedroom ["Natural Born Kissers"].
      After we [writers] established their marital problems, we needed to
      find a way to resurrect their passion, and we came up with the idea
      that they get excited by the prospect of getting caught by having sex
      in dangerous, public places. The network was worried about the overtly
      sexual theme of the story and I had to promise them that we would
      handle it tastefully. I think we pulled it off. At the end, Homer and
      Marge sprint away from a miniature golf course where they were having
      sex, but no one really catches them in a compromising position.


>> Nudity -- bad?

Michael K. Neylon: One of the comment elements that people that disliked this
   episode was the amount of nudity in this show.  While there might have
   been a lot, the animation at least did succeed in getting across the
   nudity without major problems with exposing certain parts of the body --
   that is, it was more tasteful nudity rather than the type generally
   associated with pornography.  Furthermore, the staff did a good job not to
   bring attention to the nudity itself, instead focusing on their plight of
   avoiding being seen (there's a subtle, but tasteful, difference).  The
   only joke that I think implied more than it appeared was when Marge and
   Homer were hiding behind the pinwheel-like lawn decorations - considering
   that there could have been so much more jokes of a similar nature with
   this episode, just having only one of them shows good restraint on the
   part of the production staff, and prevented this episode from becoming
   the most vulgar of OFF episode.


>> Thoughts

- Anthony Dean, "I surely hope that tonight's round of subpar animation isn't
  the new standard; the initial scene with Homer and Marge driving with the
  fridge motor looked rather poorly done."


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

- MPAA rating: TV-PG-D-L-S (most restrictive OFF has ever recieved!)

- Car Watch quickies:  One of the cars in the SNPP lot vaguely resembles a
  '57 Chevy, especially in the rear fender and taillight area.  Gil's lot has
  a VW bug on it.  Uh, you <were> looking at the cars on the lot, weren't you?
  {bjr}

- This year's finale of Dharma & Greg last week had the couple spicing up
  their love life by having sex in public places. {hl}
  [Tom Rinschler suggests, "I was thinking, since Yeardly Smith is a
  semi-regular on that show, she might have mentioned something about this
  episode within earshot of the production team of D & G?" --hmw]

- According to "Bart Simpson's Guide to Life," (p. 127) we can define the
  word "gymnoscopaphobia" as, "the fear of being seen naked."  Of course,
  since Homer and Marge have the opposite problem, we can call them
  "gymnoscopaphiliacs"! {bjr}

- Haynes Lee's alterna-title for this episode is "Sleepless in Springfield".

- Jordan Eisenberg's alterna-title is "Stark Naked Dad".

- This episode is available in video cassette in the United Kingdom (and
  VCD in some other countries), on the Simpsons "Too Hot For TV" tape.

Homer: Eh, I never thought I'd live this long.

% mud flying behind the car.
% He floors it again, sending mud all over the back window.  He does it
% again, at which point the car begins sinking in the mud.  He does it again,

-- I saw it on TV once, "Natural Born Kissers"

% This particular farmer, from inside his house, notices that some of his

% Having nearly been caught up there, Homer and Marge are excited.
% The two see this as reason enough to...er, "Rock the Casbah" there in

[End of act one.]

% Act two.  Homer repairs the refrigerator and pushes it back into place,
% and Marge and Homer begin kissing and laughing.  Bart and Lisa walk in.
