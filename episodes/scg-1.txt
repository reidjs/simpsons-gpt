                 again?

         Marge and Homer walk through the schoolyard.

         Marge: He's a good boy now, and he's getting even better. And
                sometimes, even the best sheep strays from the flock and needs
                to be hugged extra-hard.

          Melon: And now, we can continue our debate from yesterday. When we
                 left off, Calvin and Tanya were arguing that free will is an
                 illusion.
            Ian: If you ask me, human kind has freedom, but a freedom fraught
                 with paradoxes. Freud shows how childhood shapes out
                 subconscious mind, but this helps us to think for ourselves.
          Melon: Very good, Ian. Does anyone else have an example of a
                 paradox?
       %          [hands raise]
<0:05> %    ???: Without law and order, man has no freedom.
         Cecile: If you want peace, you must prepare for war.

                 class is also the quietest.
                 Bart, what other paradoxes affect our lives?
       %          [Bart looks around, surprised]
<0:04> %          [the whole class is staring at him]
