   [The following is a TV Guide-style synopsis: When Homer lands himself into
   some tax trouble, he finds himself helping the government recover a stolen
   trillion dollar bill from Mr. Burns.]

Blackboard:     I WILL NOT DEMAND / WHAT I'M WORTH
                I WILL NOT DEMAND / WHAT I'M WO (at cutoff)

Couch gag:      Rather than a couch, there is a sauna, with three guys in
                towels.

> Didja notice...
==============================================================================
   ... the Jebediah Springfield statue is covered in toilet paper?
   ... there is a framed picture of Patty or Selma above Ned and Maude's bed?
       What the--
   ... Lucius Sweet dries his sweaty forehead with money?

Alex Audet:
   ... one of the three angry guys down in Paris is French general De Gaulle?

Anthony Dean:
   ... Maggie has a noisemaker in her mouth instead of her pacifier for New
       Year's?
   ... Frink seems to have learned his lesson about forgetting to "carrying
       the one" from [2F01]?
   ... a guy diving out of the path of Homer's car when he drove up the post
       office's steps?

Nathan Mulac DeHoff:
   ... one of the people in line at the post office was the clerk from "Homer
       vs. the Eighteenth Amendment"?
   ... Burns was once the richest man in the United States (and might have
       continued to be, up until he gave away the trillion dollar bill)?
   ... Homer has presumably caused three meltdowns?
   ... Smithers didn't inform the others that Castro was in power?  (I would
       imagine that he keeps up on the news more than Burns and Homer do.)

Jordan Eisenberg:
   ... Krusty no longer cheats on his taxes?
   ... the beer can resting on Homer's 'to do' pile?
   ... the oddly cartoony crescent moon outside Moe's Tavern?
   ... the surveillance truck has no license plate number?
   ... the way everyone in the bar looked at Homer as he left? (the second
       time)
   ... the trillion dollar bill has Truman's picture on it?
   ... Truman's position in the picture?
   ... the paintings in Burns' hallway, especially that of his mother?
   ... the peacocks in Burns' yard?
   ... Maggie's head also follows the agent as he paces?
   ... Bart says 'Dad' instead of 'Homer'?
   ... Homer and Mr. Burns run over a peacock on their way out?
   ... the Malibu Stacy dolls in Smithers' apartment?
   ... Smithers irons his socks?
   ... Chief Wiggum was stationed behind a Duff billboard?
   ... Homer rolls a five and a one?
   ... the die on the left is illegal? (This may be a goof)
   ... Castro and his employees spoke English?
   ... either way, the money should have gone to a foreign nation?

Don Del Grande:
   ... at the New Year's Eve celebration, Apu was with his wife, but Sanjay
       was there without his?
   ... Marge didn't sign the return?  (To paraphrase Peg Bundy of "Married...
       With Children", "they can't get you if you don't sign the form")
   ... the IRS knew to find Homer at Moe's?  (Then again, Homer called
       President Clinton from there in 1F13)
   ... Burns, who can get all the electricity he wants for free, has a gas
       stove?

Tony Hill:
   ... Ned wears glasses to bed?
   ... Burns flies the "Spirit of Springfield"?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Nelson drinking wihiskey on New Year's Eve?
   ... the top secret film is rated TV PG?

Haynes Lee:
   ... Monty Burns' plane looks like Charles Lindberg's "Spirit of St. Louis"?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... despite what Homer said, Lisa's book did not have pictures?
   ... the two-sided chair the IRS men sat upon?  (I like to think of it as a
       Janus chair.)
   ... Burns and Smithers were both dumb enough to let Homer hold on to the
       trillion-dollar bill?

   - After the network's protracted salary negotiations with the cast, many
     people on <alt.tv.simpsons> suggested that an episode reference the
     dispute.  Do you think tonight's blackboard gag ("I will not demand
     what I'm worth") will satisfy them?  This has got to set the record
     for the shortest gap between the time something happened, and the time
     the show referenced it.  (Oh, wait, I get it now.  The whole salary
     dispute thing was just to set up tonight's blackboard gag.) {bjr}

   - The stuck New Year's ball, and the fact that you never learn what year
     Springfield is ringing in, may reference the fact that time seems to

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Alex Audet: To me, it was a funny episode until Homer ran away.  After that,
   it was below average. The first part with the New Year celebration, the
   last day for taxes, and when Homer got busted was great. But when Homer,
   Burns and Smithers went to Cuba it wasn't really good.  (B-)

Ben Collins: This is one of the worst Simpsons episodes ever made, and
   possibly THE worst: pointless, unfunny, and poorly written. Writer Ian
   Maxtone-Graham starts with a weak, meandering story and fills it with
   stale, flat gags and ludicrous, un-Simpsonslike ideas (the "trillion dollar
   bill," Lisa shrugging off college, and many others I choose not to think
   about). If you tilt your head a little and use your imagination, this D-
   might look like me sticking my tongue out at the current "staff."  (D-)

Chris Courtois: The trouble with "The Trouble With Trillions" was the trouble
   I've had with Ian Maxtone-Graham's two previous episodes. The episodes
   aren't bad like a Keeler or Crittenden show, rather they seem like
   "synthetic" episodes - not really "The Simpsons", but a good simulation of
   the show. "Burns Baby Burns" seemed to be the work of a computer program
   or writer with a checklist ticking off the where-is-Springfield joke, the
   Smithers-is-gay gag, and other favorite elements in an attempt to follow a
   formula for a smash show. This show bogged down in the second act with the
   Scully-era mandatory gratuitous references to previous episodes (this show
   must hold the record for the most previous episode references in a non-clip
   show), and with Lisa's PC-thug government oppression rant (loved Homer's
   putting it all in perspective though with his "but I'm not fat?"). The
   first and third acts had good gags hanging from off of a far fetched plot.
   I would have liked to have seen a subplot stemming from Marge's "You sure
   had talent, kid" lament, maybe even a semi-sequel to "Brush With
   Greatness". (If they're gonna toss out references to old shows, why not go
   all the way, and do a follow-up show?) Overall the jokey first and third
   acts and the political satire offset the weak second act enough for this
   one to get a...  (B)

Anthony Dean: While this episode had its moments (Castro's reaction to the San
   Francisco street named after him, the ball drop on New Year's Eve, everyone
   rushing to the Post Office), it still seemed to suffer a bit in spots,
   particularly in the third act and its abrupt ending.  (C+)

Nathan Mulac DeHoff: There were a lot of good jokes in this one, and it wasn't
   quite as unrealistic as last week's episode (although that's not saying
   very much, and the idea of a trillion dollar bill is still pretty
   ridiculous).  The plot was good overall.  The Cuba part seemed to be tacked
   on, but it was quite amusing.  There were a few slow parts, and the ending
   seemed a bit too abrupt, but it was still one of the better offerings this
   season.  (A-)

Jordan Eisenberg: This episode met expectations exactly.  It fit the standard
   form of a 5F episode:  An outstanding first act, a relatively slow second
   act and a third act low on gags that takes everything to such an unneededly
   bizarre climax that it doesn't have enough time to adequately finish.  The
   gags of the first and second acts were decent, while nothing was ROTFL.
   Marge and the kids had only a few minutes of air time as usual, and Mr.
   Burns was slightly out of character.  And I absolutely loved the bit about
   Marge's painting!  (B-)

Alex Foley: A some-what good Act I, which decends to pure crap by the end of
   Act II (excluding Homer's putting one of the agent's hands on the other
   butt and the IRS video). Lisa's "who needs college" line was just painful,
   and once again the writers apparently forgot to write an ending, and left
   it like that. Homer was too much of an idiot, Burns and Smithers also
   appeared off to me. A very disappointing episode.  (D+)

Andrew Gill: Well, I don't know exactly how to review this one.  It left a
   general distastefulness in my mouth, but it was just mediocre enough to
   deserve an honest grade.  Idiot Homer was back.  So were the zany plots
   (why do they have to be zany).  The flawed premises were also back, along
   with the mischaracterization of Lisa ("Who needs college? ...Let's buy
   dune buggies!"). There was yet more cartoon physics. (Shouldn't Homer have
   a concussion from the door on the PO?) Let's hope that the 200th is all
   that it's cracked up to be.  (C+)

Tony Hill: This episode contained plenty of LOL moments (Homer stopping for
   hot dog), but somehow the ridiculous anti-patriotism didn't work.  The
   characters were downright goofy, and even Lisa was acting out of character
   by eschewing college.  (B-)

Joe Klemm: I felt that the episode had a lot of problems. First, I felt that
   the whole Homer with the FBI thing was rushed so that we can get to the
   Cuba scenes. Second, I doubt anyone would be that stupid to mail their
   taxes at 10 P.M. Last, the ending was very abrupt with nothing clever to
   it.  (D)

Haynes Lee: Finally a good Burns episode with Fidel Castro to boot. The
   ending was abrupt though.  (A)

Ondre Lombard: I'm not sure if sheer physical agony might've detracted from
   my enjoyment of this episode, or if missing the first six minutes (three,
   actually, 8:00-8:03 probably was filled with commercials) disqualifies me
   from reviewing it. Regardless, I saw enough to get the gist of the plot.
   Homer's stupidity causes him to chip in his slipshod, last-minute tax
   returns, leading to IRS trouble.  I might have to agree that this episode
   takes some weird twists and turns.  Why the IRS would adopt a clear
   bonehead for no apparent reason to do their spying and snitching is beyond
   me, and the trillion dollar bill takes some serious liberties with reality.
   I can say that there were some genuinely funny moments (Homer trying to get
   confessions, the TV PG on the secret camera thing, how easily Apu got that
   confidential info, Mr. Burns trying to scald Homer, Homer placing the FBI
   agent's hand on his partner's butt...), but the plot was at worst
   ridiculous, at best weak and lame.  I swear to God I'll kill the next
   writer who creates another complicated situation and gives it no solid
   resolution.  (F, but, as Mrs. Krabappel said in 7F03, "it's a high F," if
   only for some humorous moments.)

Emmett McKenna: Very disapointing Simpsons. I wish they would stick to
   mocking Capitalism and not Socialism. The Batista jokes were good, but I
   don't think it was funny how they made Capitalism to be the good system
   in this episode. And I really didn't like how they had Mr. Burns stand up
   for a worker... thats not something he'd usually do, its not like his
   character or the character he is trying to represent as a rich corporate
   jerk who does everything for the betterment of his money, not for any
   people. It was truely a bad episode. I give it a...  (D+)

Michael K. Neylon: I really can't say much about this episode , save that it
   combines nearly all the faults that I find with the current staff.  We
   have Homer acting stupid (though not as bad as 4F22, for example), while
   plots that go beyond the minor reality that OFF initially had (a trillion
   dollar ball?  At least be a BIT realistic...), terrible characterization
   (That was Mr. Burns? Acted like some really other odd character; Lisa
   would NEVER EVER NEVER say "Who needs college?" in that sense. Maybe if
   she was being sarcastic, but that delivery wasn't there.), and a lack of
   a plot that goes anywhere.
   The initially idea, of Homer being in tax trouble would have made a good
   episode, if they stuck to that idea.  But once Homer is recruited by
   the IRS, this episode fails, and the writers never seem to be able to
   recover.  I hardly laughed at this episode, and was waiting for it to end.
   I dare for someone to say that this episode is better than anything 
   produced during the 3rd or 4th season.  There was very little in this 
   episode resembling a Simpsons episode.

John Ogan: Well, it started to make me worry about my tax returns... I just
   got them off today (April 10).  Other than that, just another farfetched
   plot that made me laugh a few times.  A nice "filler" episode to kind of
   dull the enthusiasm I've had for most of this season's episodes, which
   I've loved for the most part.  Wasn't a trip to Cuba the plot of a "Critic"
   episode as well?  Anyway, I loved the scenes with Fidel, I don't mind the
   story being left in the air in the end every now and then.  But I have a
   suggestion, though...if time is a problem, either make it a two-parter, or
   don't write the episode.  Thanks.  (C)

Damian Penny: I thought the ending was pretty abrupt, and we've been seeing
   that a lot more lately.  But I still laughed all the way through,
   especially the black-and-white movie about how the trillion dollar bill was
   supposed to go to Europe.  ("Losers.")  (B)

Jeremy Reaban: This was a strange episode. Much like last weeks, reality has
   no place in this episode. It did have a plot, of sorts, although it could
   have used a real ending, not just everyone on a raft. I mean, would Mr
   Burns bribe a jury to get Homer off? He's the one facing the most charges.
   Having said that, the episode was pretty funny - especially if you dislike
   Europeans (particularly the French) and the US government.  Minuses - Lisa
   sort of acted out of character. If she were suddenly rich, I might expect
   her to buy something, like Malibu Stacies, but not dune buggies. [Not to
   mention her "who needs college?" comment! --hmw]  (A-)

Tom Rinschler: A pretty funny episode!  The plot meandered, but at least
   that's better than last week's jumpy episode.  It was fun to see a good
   Burns/Smithers episode again.  Also amusing was the kids' reaction to
   getting a trillion dollars (Lisa doesn't need college after all!)  A nice,
   if not perfect romp.  (B)

Benjamin Robinson: This show plays like two episodes in one:  A reality-based
   show at the beginning, it slowly transforms into an eccentric adventure.
   Monty Burns really made this one with a hilarious turn as his arrogant,
   power-hungry self.  There's also a funny appearance by Cuban strongman
   Fidel Castro.  Note also the episode's conservative stance on political
   issues, which is uncharacteristic of "The Simpsons."  (B+)

Laverne Smith: I thought this week's episode was a lot funnier than last
   week's, but the trillion dollar bill (with Truman's portrait no less) was
   totally unrealistic, as others have mentioned already. Could it have been
   a billion dollar bill, at least? Yes, I know it's a cartoon, but why throw
   in so many historical facts and figures (the end of World War II in 1945,
   Truman, Castro, Batista, etc.) and then something so farfetched?  I can
   remember when Reagan proposed the first trillion dollar budget (1987?)

Yours truly: A fun and entertaining episode, with a good balance of jokes,
   seriousness, and plot development. The third act was a bit far-fetched,
   but funny nonetheless. The ending wasn't very satisfying, however, leaving
   various questions unanswered. (How did they get home? What their
   punishment was, if any, when they got back? etc.)  (B)

>> I Will Not Demand What I'm Worth

The blackboard gag is clearly a reference to the voice actors of the show
   demanding more money for their services in a dispute which ended as
   recently as a week ago. It seems blackboard gags can be created at the
   last minute!


>> New Years is delayed
Jordan Eisenberg: If I'm not mistaken, the dropping ball actually did get
   stuck one year in Times Square, and it has been parodied in other shows.
   Some may recall a Mad About You episode based entirely around this
   incident.  The bit with Wiggum shooting the ball and the audience counting
   at a greater speed until the ball catches fire is a Simpsons original,
   though.


>> A taxing situation

Benjamin Robinson: This item is primarily for the non-U.S. audience; Americans
   are all too familiar with the IRS, and can skip to the next comment.

   In the United States, a federal income tax came into existence on  1913.
   Today, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is charged with the collection of
   this tax.  The deadline for filing your tax information with them is April
   15th and, while a few disciplined souls -- like Flanders -- do file in
   January, most people put it off for as long as they can.  Traditionally,
   the town's central post-office will stay open extra-late that day to
   accommodate procrastinators.  Just as traditionally, news hounds like Kent
   Brockman will camp out and do a feature story on them.  (Hey, it's not
   often when you can predict where a news story will occur, so it's best not
   to waste the opportunity.)  Incidentally, so long as you are standing in
   the line at midnight, the post office will postmark your IRS form with the
   April 15 date, even if it's past the deadline when you get to the head of
   the queue.

   The IRS is probably the most-hated government agency, and not just because
   nobody likes to pay their taxes.  Tax forms can be fiendishly complex, and
   if you make even one mistake, you could be in for an expensive audit. Come
   to think of it, you could be in for an audit even if you do nothing wrong;
   the IRS <randomly> chooses returns for auditing, just to keep everyone
   honest.  Although one of the agents suggest that Homer's form was flagged
   by a computer (and the IRS does have computers that can do this), the way
   the form bounces into the "audit" bin suggests dumb luck.  Also, notice
   how the agents assume that Homer is guilty, and demand that he prove his
   innocence.  This is the opposite of how criminal proceedings work in the
   U.S., and is one reason for the IRS's unpopularity.

   By the way, the seal on the IRS desk is the actual IRS seal.  To me, it
   looks like the eagle has his dukes up, ready to beat the taxpayer into
   submission.


>> Marshalling up some help

Benjamin Robinson: The Allies might have won World War II, but the conflict
   left much of Europe in ruins.  With most of the continent in poverty, the
   U.S. government feared that the desperate people might turn to Communism,
   or worse, that another dictator might arise and spark World War III.
   (Remember, Hitler and Mussolini rose to power in part by promising relief
   from the Great Depression, which affected Europe as well as the States.)
   The Marshall Plan was a huge government foreign aid package designed to
   help the Europeans get back on their feet and, not coincidentally, remain
   allies of the Americans.  Although foreign aid today is despised as a
   waste of tax funds, the Marshall Plan was a success.  Despite some
   political differences, Germany and Italy remain in the American camp to
   this day, and the Communists did not extend their power in Europe beyond
   the nations that they possessed at the conclusion of the War.


>> That's-a lot of zeros!

Benjamin Robinson: There was no trillion dollar bill; in fact, there were no
   bills in a denomination higher than $10,000.  The $10K note, along with
   companion $5,000 and $1,000 bills, was never intended for circulation
   among the general public.  Instead, it was used for inter-bank fund
   transfers.  If one bank needed to send a few hundred million to another
   bank, it could send one armored truck filled with $10,000 bills, rather
   than a convoy of trucks with lesser bills.  As this episode demonstrates,
   that could be dangerous if a dishonest guard decided to pocket a few
   thousand dollars.  Eventually, electronic fund transfers made the
   physical hauling of cash obsolete, and the $10K bill was retired from
   service.  The largest denomination you can get today is the $100 bill.
   (Trivia note:  The $10K bill featured the portrait of Salman (Salmon?) P.
   Chase, who was the U.S. Treasurer in the mid 1800's.)

But after some further research, Benjamin discovered a $100K bill had been
   printed: It appears as though the government issued a $100,000 gold note,
   which is currency but not the same thing as an x-dollar bill [it only
   existed for official bank transactions and never circulated outside
   federal banks --hmw].  It also implies that the $10,000 bill is the
   largest "standard" dollar bill denomination.

Haynes Lee adds: At the height of pre-WWII Germany hyperinflation, the German
   government printed a billion mark note. Even then, it was printed on only
   one side.


>> Why the trillion dollar bill wouldn't work.

Andrew Gill:
   - Even in 1959, our GNP would have increased by about 35% (Unless the
     figures are in millions of dollars.)
   - The government would immediately declare it void.
   - No one's going to believe that there's a trillion dollar bill.
   - No one can break a trillion dollar bill, so you'd have to spend it in
     one place -- the government.
   - Thus, even though it says 1 TRILLION on it, it's worthless.  Even Burns
     would have known that it would be more valuable to him for the bill to
     be delivered than to be stolen.


>> Cyanide capsules

Andrew Gill: (Assuming that they were cyanide capsules, of course) Homer
   obviously wasn't well-trained in how to use cyanide pills.  You put one
   in your mouth the instant that a compromising situation could result, and
   you wait for certainty.  If the situation turns ugly, you bite down, and
   die quickly, but if not, you swallow and nothing happens (if I recall
   correctly, that is.)


>> That <was> a spicy meatball

Benjamin Robinson: Alka Seltzer's "spicy meatball" ad is today considered a
   classic commercial (assuming you grant the possibility that the word
   "classic" can be associated with the word "commercial").  The setup is
   simple:  A crew is filming another commercial, for a spicy spaghetti
   sauce.  The actor in this faux ad is supposed to eat a meatball and say,
   "That's-a spicy meatball!"  Everything goes wrong, and this poor guy has
   to eat about a cow's worth of meatballs.  Fortunately, he can cure the
   resulting indigestion with several shots of Jack Daniels.  Just kidding!
   It's Alka-Seltzer to the rescue, of course.  The commercial ran in the
   late Sixties or possibly the early Seventies, and the catch phrase became
   well known.  No surprise here that jingle-mad Homer still remembers it.


>> They'd get it out sooner, but the committee was busy watching "Melrose
   Place"

Benjamin Robinson: High-definition TV (HDTV) is a new high-resolution
   digital television broadcast standard.  Or it <should> be a new standard,
   but has actually been vaporware for the last few years or so.  Everybody
   with a stake in the broadcast industry -- television networks, station
   affiliates, consumer watchdogs, the electronics industry, even Microsoft
   -- has been pushing contradicting ideas.  Recently, Congress announced a
   rollout timetable for HDTV, so the foot-dragging may finally be over.


>> El Duffo O Muerte

Emmett McKenna: The painting of the man holding the beer next to him saying
   "el Duffo o muerte" (duff or death) was a painting of Ernesto "che"
   Guevara. He helped the Cuban revolution in the late 50's. There is a
   real painting of him like that in Cuba in the Revolution Plaza. But I
   don't think it says anything on it, and if it did it probably would be
   "¡Socialismo o Muerte!" (socialism or death). He was also refered to in
   "Mr. Burns Got Shot: Part 2" at that Cuban night club called "Chez
   Guevara." He is an interesting person, you people might want to read up
   on him.


>> Car Watch, Cuban style

Benjamin Robinson: The first taxi to pull away from the cab stand was a
   1957 Ford.  Burns identifies the next car as "the new Packard."  The
   rear fender does look vaguely like a 1956 Packard, but the taillights
   aren't correct.  The headlight profile also could be from the '56
   Packard.  The rest of the car is pretty generic.  (Incidentally, if you
   wanted to see the "new" Packard, you'd have to travel back to 1958, when
   the last one was built.)

   So, you might be wondering, why are the Cubans so fascinated with
   Fifties-era iron?  After Castro seized the island, the U.S. government
   forbade all trade between Americans and the Cubans, including cars.  The
   Cubans could still buy Soviet-made cars, but these were hard to come by
   (as in most Communist-bloc countries) and seemed to disintegrate upon
   contact with air.  In response, the Cubans nursed along the last
   American-built cars to make it to the island.  They're still there today,
   chugging along with hundreds and hundreds of thousands of miles on the
   odometer.  And you thought the Japanese made durable cars.


>> The China Syndrome

Joe Klemm: The China Syndrome is a 1979 film about a near meltdown of a
   nuclear power plant. The film was a hit, thanks to the Three Mile Island
   incident that happened around the same time the film was released.
   [Coincidence? --hmw]


>> Castro Street

Don Del Grande: Castro Street in San Francisco IS full of... well, suffice it
   to say that "Castro Street" is to homosexuality what "Wall Street" is to
   finance; however, it's named after Joaquin Isidro de Castro, not Fidel.
   (Maybe the Castro Street in Berkeley...)


>> Stars Mentioned

Tony Hill: Joey Heatherton has appeared on movies, TV and records but
   probably isn't considered a star in any of them.  She's best known as a
   lounge singer in Vegas.
   Spring Byington was a movie star of the 1930s and 40s.  She's probably
   best remembered as the star of the 50s sitcom "December Bride."


>> 9 Returns a Day

Tony Hill: The IRS computer processes 9 returns per day.  When I worked for
   the Minnesota Department of Revenue, our goal was 20,000 per day.


>> Two Guys From Quantico Pizza

Tony Hill: Quantico is a small town in Virginia outside Washington where
   IRS computers are kept.  There's also a USMC base there.


>> This is the suit Charlie Chaplin was buried in!

Tony Hill: Charlie Chaplin's body was stolen from a cemetary in Switzerland
   not long after his death in 1977.  OFF seems to intimate that Burns did it.


>> Colliers Magazine

Tony Hill: According to the Library of Congress, Collier's Magazine folded
   with the issue dated January 4, 1957. [Typical Burns! --hmw]


>> Immortal threads

- Smithers gay?: wearing pink feminine bathrobe. {hl}
- Where is Springfield?: Florida (close to Cuba). {hl}


>> Musical references

   + "Everything's Coming up Rose's"
     - Smithers was singing it {je}
       (Tony Hill adds, it was written by Stephen Sondheim and Jule Styne for
       the 1959 Broadway musical "Gypsy," in which it was introduced by Ethel
       Merman.")

   + "Auld Lang Syne"
     - written to traditional music by Robert Burns, no relation to Monty {th}


>> Miscellaneous

- An interesting correlation between 7F18 and this one also is that Marge asked
  Smithers why he puts up with doing thankless tasks for Mr. Burns, and he
  seems tolerant of this fact.  Now he has grown annoyed with getting no
  thanks for what he does for Mr. Burns.  (He also seemed a bit less
  subserviant to Mr. Burns in this episode, too.  Very begrudging.) {ol}

- Did Homer remember to include Marge's self-employment income from her
  pretzel stand? {ddg}

- Yet another reference of Burns' ancient views:  Batista was kicked out of
  Cuba in 1959! {tr}

- MPAA rating: TV-PG

- Jordan Eisenberg's alterna-title for the episode: "Raging Monty Burns and
  his Grumbling Employees in 'The Curse of the Spying Tax Hitch'".

- Haynes Lee's alterna-title is "A Farewell To Burns".

 Smithers: Ah, I'm afraid we've got to get out of the country.
Mr. Burns: Capitol idea! Let's blow this fascist popsicle stand! Purchase a
           small island somewhere, and start our own country free from the
           relentless tyranny of.. Uncle Sam.
    Homer: But I can't leave the country, what about my wife and kids?
 Smithers: [unimpressed] That can be shipped.

% Agent Johnson is at the Simpsons home, asking the kids what they think Homer
% would do with a trillion dollars. The kids are delighted to hear that their
% father is rich, and Marge tells them the money is going towards their
% college education. Lisa uncharacteristically says "who needs college?" and
% suggests they buy dune buggies instead.

% Burns and Smithers are ready to leave, but Homer isn't on their plane.
% He's trying to buy some Buzz Cola from a machine with the trillion dollar
% bill! Burns tells him there is soda on the plane, so he jumps aboard. It's
% a small plane, just enough for the three of them. Soon enough, they are
% flying above the ocean, about to leave US territory.

Agent Johnson: [in another plane] Attention, fugitives! You are leaving US
               jurisdiction. Turn back immediately, or we will be unable to
               prosecute you!
        Homer: [worried] We'd better do what he says!
-- "The Trouble With Trillions"

% Naturally, they continue their escape, since they are now above
% international waters.

Agent Johnson: Oh nuts!
 Agent Miller: They'll be back. They'll miss American TV!
-- "The Trouble With Trillions"

% The three fugitives see various islands.

Mr. Burns: Any of these islands would make a fine new country!
    Homer: I call president!
Mr. Burns: Vice president!
 Smithers: [miserable] Ohhh...
-- "The Trouble With Trillions"

Mr. Burns: There's a big one, and it has freedom written all over it!
 Smithers: Sir, that's Cuba.
Mr. Burns: Cuba, eh?  Take her down, Smithers!
 Smithers: Uh, you're flying the plane, sir...
Mr. Burns: Excellent.
-- "The Trouble With Trillions"

% They have landed.

Sorry about the landing, boys. This fog is so thick I can't even see my own
cataracts!
-- Mr. Burns, "The Trouble With Trillions"

% Homer phones Marge, as Burns, Smithers and Homer.

Mr. Burns: So you say Batista's gone! [to Homer] Did you know that?
    Homer: I had no idea!
Mr. Burns: In that case just take us to whoever's in charge!
-- Burns' ancient views, "The Trouble With Trillions"

% Elsewhere, Castro talks to his associates.

Castro: Comrads, our nation is completely bankrupt! We have no choice but to
        abandon communism!
   All: [sighs]
Castro: I know, I know, I know... but we all knew from day one this mumbo
        jumbo wouldn't fly!  I'll call Washington and tell them they won.
   Man: But presidente, America tried to kill you!
Castro: Ah, they're not so bad. They even named a street after me in San
        Francisco!
 Man 2: [whispers in Castro's ear]
Castro: It's full of <what>?!
-- "The Trouble With Trillions"

% One of Castro's workers tells him some men with a trillion dollar bill are
% here to see him.

Mr. Burns: Oh, so the island's not for sale, eh? Well, will you at least
           permit us to live in your socialist paradise?
   Castro: You talking about Cuba?
-- "The Trouble With Trillions"

Mr. Burns: All we ask is preferential treatment because of my fabulous wealth!
           [Burns holds the trillion dollar bill up.]
   Castro: May I see?
Mr. Burns: Ho ho ho, see with your eyes, not with your hands!
   Castro: Please, we are all amigos here!
    Homer: Mr. Burns.. I think we can trust the president of Cuba..
Mr. Burns: [hands it to Castro, and waits a couple of seconds.] Now, give it
           back...
   Castro: Give what back?
Mr. Burns: D'ohh...
-- "The Trouble With Trillions"

% The three men are on a crudely made raft in the middle of the ocean headed
% back home.

    Homer: It's hard to believe there's a place worse than America, but we
           found it!
Mr. Burns: Yes, I too feel renewed appreciation for the good old US of A.
           Oppression and harrassment are a small price to pay to live in the
           land of the free.
 Smithers: Sir, aren't you facing some serious jail time?
Mr. Burns: Well, if it's a crime to love one's country, then I'm guilty. And
           if it's a crime to steal a trillion dollars from our government and
           hand it over to communist Cuba, then I'm guilty of that too. And if
           it's a crime to bribe a jury, then so help me, I'll soon be guilty
           of that!
    Homer: God bless America!
