> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [SNPP.com] When Springfield is named the "World's Fattest Town", thanks to
   a diabolical scheme by the Motherloving Sugar Corporation, Marge takes it
   upon herself to rid the entire town of the sweet stuff. Guest stars Ben
   Stiller as Garth Motherloving.

Blackboard:     none

Couch:          The family members take their places on the couch, as usual.
                A giant mechanical claw, like the kind in the machines where
                players must grab small stuffed animals, reaches down and
                grabs Homer.  As he shouts, "Ow!  My brain!" the claw lifts
                him off the couch and out of frame.

> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================

Don Del Grande:
   ... this episode started two minutes early (at least in the west)?
   ... someone stuffing billiard balls in his mouth is on a picture on the
       wall of the book company's office?
   ... nobody suggested the "world's largest ball of humans" as a possible
       record?
   ... Lunch Lady Doris was in the crowd when they announced Springfield was
       the world's fattest city?
   ... there was a lawsuit in Springfield and Lionel Hutz was nowhere to be
       seen?
   ... the episode was rated PG with no additional letters, despite the phrase
       "Hershey Highwayman" being used?  (The censors must have been taking
       golden showers during that scene)
   ... there was no mention of how much money the plaintiffs won in the suit?
   ... apparently, Apu had sugar in his milk?
   ... Cletus has a last name?
   ... the boat was Gone Fission [even though there's a "Gone Fission II"]?
   ... they got the sugar from San Glucose, which is ironic as Springfield was
       sans glucose?
   ... this episode was "dedicated to the memory of Ron Taylor" (with a
       picture of Bleeding Gums Murphy), although it was rather brief compared
       to their other dedications? ["Suffered fatal heart attack according to
       E! television network," says John Green.  "He was 49" -- Ed.]

Otto Dietrich:
   ... the only activity that Garth Motherloving had scheduled for that day on
       his day timer besides "Evil Deeds" [...] was "Racquetball" at 11:00!

Alex Foley:
   ... Maggie holding a book at the library?
   ... Llewelyn Sinclair (from 8F18) was part of the human pyramid?
   ... Charles Darden as one of the lawyers swarming Marge's car?
   ... Gil actually came out on top (by winning the lawsuit) for a change?

Joe Green:
   ... the guy who attached 116 clothespins to his face and neck is named
       Kevin Thackwell?

Chad Lehman:
   ... the Duff record guy looks like newspaper editor from [AABF21]?
   ... Marge uses a shopping cart -- at the Kwik-E-Mart?
   ... the possible cut: After Motherloving says "Get the hell out of my
       office", Marge says "-- and I want you to stop putting so much SUGAR in
       everything" as if finishing a previous (cut) sentence?"
   ... Motherloving forgets Marge's name for one line ("Look, lady ...") but
       remembers it the next? ("Note to Marge ...")

Tom Restivo:
   ... the Geeky Corporate Lawyer not only lost (for the first time, if ever),
       but to *Gil* on his first case?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Homer seems to have conquered his fear of cobras?
   ... Bart and Lisa can support Homer's weight?
   ... as the camera pans past the yard of children coming down from their
       sugar high, one of the kids falls off the jungle gym?
   ... the two buttons Homer chooses between at the climax of the episode are
       visible on the dash as Homer and Bart contemplate escaping?
   ... how excited Maggie is by a dip in the sugar water?

=  When Homer fell from the pyramid, there was quite a bit of space
   surrounding him; he shouldn't have been able to grab somebody.  {ddg}

*  Technically, it wasn't a pyramid any more if Maggie was on top of just
   Homer.  (They should have put Marge with her hairdo on the top.)  {ddg}

=  When the people-ball is rolling toward Hans Moleman and Agnes Skinner, you
   can see another Moleman in the ball if you watch in slo-mo (upper left
   corner of the screen, I believe).  That's how he keeps dying and coming
   back! There are multiple Molemen!  {jg3}

*  As of this writing and the episode's first airing, the fattest city in the
   US was Chicago, not Milwaukee.  {jc}

=  In the wide shot where Lou throws the promotional Johnny Depp from the
   movie Chocolat on the fire, he's white.  {ob}

+  Some of the merchandise associated with the show lists Cletus's last name
   as "Delroy."  [While confusing, this isn't a true goof.  When the show and
   its merchandise are in conflict, the show wins.  See "Comments" section for
   more -- Ed.]

c  As Homer enters the Lard Lad boy, he says, "Wow."  The closed captioning
   reads, "Wow.  Should I take off my shoes?"  {tpl}

=  The hand pushing the "Dump Cargo" button appeared to have a yellow shirt
   cuff, but Homer was wearing a white short-sleeved shirt.  {bjr}

=  When Lisa and Bart jump into the sugar water, in the next scene they're
   splashing each other - but Lisa was holding Maggie when she jumped in.

   Maggie saved Homer from drowning?" -- Ed.]  {ddg}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Bob Clark:  This was a great episode.  Loved Maggie wiping vegemite [toaster
   pie stuffing, actually -- Ed.] off her face, [it was] reminiscent of the
   Lisa Dodgeball scene from season one.  The only things I didn't like about
   this episode were some of the fat jokes, namely the Cletus scene.  But I
   loved Dr. Hibbert losing his temper, Ralph Wiggum (as always),the "Bad Guy"
   button on the boat, but my favourite was the huge pyramid and the
   Mississippis!  At first I was cringing with the "Marge is on a mission"
   storyline which I didn't like very much the first time around, but this
   episode for me is A- material.  (A-)

Alex Foley:  Again we have 3 different plots for the 3 acts, which were,
   overall, rather weak.  However, unlike the last two episodes.  it made me
   laugh, which is the most I can hope for in any OFF episode, esp. a Marge
   episode.  The jokes supported the weak plot, which makes this the best of
   the Al Jean era so far.  (B)

Joe Green:  This show started out with a strong first act, and after that a
   typically silly and farfetched plot was redeemed by some better than
   average gags (like Disco Stu snorting sugar and the unemployed lawyers).
   Not exactly one of the all-time greats, but it kept me amused for a solid
   half-hour.  (C+)

Tony Hill:  There were a lot of laughs in this episode, but they're really
   scraping the bottom of the barrel plot-wise.  Homer's quips were often too
   sophisticated for him.  Blue hair 'n' brocco'-witch?  Too many elements
   were recycled from earlier episodes for this to get better than a  (D+)

Steve X:  Well, it was only three or so seasons, but they finally got back on
   track.  An episode that had good timing and jokes that made me laugh is
   something that is always good.  My only semi-complaint is that Homer cannot
   go an entire episode without going into a screaming rant.  As good as it is
   going to get.  (A-)

Yours Truly:  "Sweets and Sour Marge" gets a lot of the "serious" things
   right:  characterization and pacing among them, but falls down on the
   comedy.  A lot of the jokes are too thin to cover the unlikely plot,
   there's no compelling bad guy, and some of the supporting cast is wasted.
   There are some good moments, but not enough to save what's ultimately a
   mediocre episode.  (C)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B- (2.67)   Std Dev.: 0.8844   (6 reviews computed)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Meta-reference corner

Joe Green:  I though this episode had two good "meta-references": Marge
   pointing out that Homer waits until he actually gets to an event to say he
   doesn't like the idea of it, and Homer's cliched "The Simpsons are going to
   Mars!" line.

   Also, the joke about how Butterfingers are so bad even the fire doesn't
   want them is ironic, considering not only that "Simpsons" characters have
   repeatedly been used to advertise Butterfinger, but that the candy bar is
   said to be a personal favorite of Matt Groening.


>> Musical References

Joe Green:  "Miami Vice Theme" by Ján Hammer.

   "I Want Candy" by the Strangeloves  played when the Springfield police burn
   candy.

   "Sugar Sugar" by the Archies.


Ted Schuerzinger:  "More, More, More (Part 1)" by the Andrea True Connection.


Dan Dreibelbis:  You young whippersnappers :) who weren't around when "More
   More More" was a hit may have already heard a part of this song in the last
   few years: the short bridge part was sampled and used as the main riff in
   "Steal My Sunshine" by Len.


>> Those Never-Ending Threads

 - Where is Springfield

Ted Schuerzinger:  In "Behind the Laughter", the "real" Simpsons were
   supposedly from northern Kentucky.  Homer refers to Tennessee as "south of
   the border", which is the state immediately south of Kentucky.


Joe Green adds:  ... or possibly the far southwestern corner of Virginia.


Dan S:  Yeah ... but Homer thinks, "Canada's all tucked away down there."


>> Alec Guinness fans, read and weep

Steven Miles:  According to the 2001 edition of Guinness World Records, one
   day in 1951, Sir Arthur Beaver, owner of Guinness (the Irish beer company)
   was at a pub.  He "was involved in a dispute as to whether the golden
   plover was Europe's fastest game bird."  A few years later, another
   argument came up involving the grouse. Then, Guinness realized that
   arguments about such topics came up in pubs all the time (i. e. Lenny and
   Carl).  We like to call this kind of thing "bar trivia."  Sir Arthur wanted
   to create a book that could aid in such disputes at pubs.

   With help, he did that, and it was a hit.  Today, Guinness World Records is
   seen all over the world, and it's a popular reference.


Speaking of world records, Chris Read writes:  When Homer looked up the most
   clothespins stuck to one's face and neck in the Duff Book of World Records,
   it seems like they got the information from Guinness.  In the Duff book,
   the caption on the guy was Kevin Thackwell.  In the Guinness World Records
   2001, Kevin Thackwell is the guy who has the record in real life, too.
   Homer even got the number right: 116.  (it's on page 18 of the hard-bound
   edition.)


>> A Chilling Look At What Makes Our Government Tick ... And Explode

About Moe's favorite book, Jeff Cross writes:  "Op-Center" is one of the three
   novel series that Tom Clancy created but didn't actually write himself;
   this one, co-created with fellow political thriller author Steve Pieczenik
   and written by Jeff Rovin, follows the workings of the National Crisis
   Management Center and its handling of national intelligence-gathering and
   military assets to shut down major international incidents before they can
   get lethal.  As of this writings, it is eight novels long and even has a
   prequel miniseries starring Harry Hamlin as NCMC director Paul Hood.


>> Sizing things up

Chuck Knudsen:  The scale reads 64,152 pounds.  The only whole numbers that
   make sense for this are 297 and 216.  (216 * 297 = 64152)  So there are
   either 216 residents in Springfield weighing an average of 297 pounds, or
   297 residents in Springfield weighing an average of 216 pounds.


>> First You Get The Sugar, Then You Get The Power

Jeff Cross:  In the 1700s the sugar industry actually had major political
   power in England due to its enormous profit margins.  [It's still a major
   lobbying force in Florida -- Ed.]  There were even instances when
   representatives of the sugar plantation owners would run for seats in the
   House of Commons from unimportant outlying districts to be able to push
   their agenda.


>> Cletus who?

"Vandergr" notes:  According to the Simpsons Trivial Box Calendar, Cletus's
   last name is Delroy (January 2nd).


Adam Toner adds:  http://www.snpp.com/guides/whoiswho.html has him as Cletus
   Delroy, though it doesn't say which episode they got "Delroy" from.


Theodore Paulakis:  "The Simpsons Guide to Springfield" also has it as Cletus
   Delroy.


Dr. Music rebuts:  Okay, I'll put it more bluntly.  Who are you going to
   believe, THE SHOW, or some stupid calendar?


Ian Boothby:  He wasn't sure he remembered how to write it correctly, so maybe
   it's just a bad spelling of Delroy.


Keith Gename speculates:  Maybe "Spuckler" will turn up to be his *middle*
   name in a future episode. "Cletus Spuckler Delroy".  Sounds likes he could
   be a senator from Alabama.  Or maybe even a televangelist.


Russell Flowers:  It's spelled Spuckler, but pronounced, "Del - Roy."  It's a
   regional dialect.


>> Explanation is forthcoming

Chad Lehman:  On ATS, the question was asked: Why was Burns involved?  This
   was used as an argument against the episode.  The answer seems obvious.
   "Motherloving" understood Burns' power, and he also needed a boat for the
   job.  Mr. Burns has much power, and also a boat.  Thus, he was recruited by
   Motherloving, just as Apu and Homer apparently were.


>> "If only the sugar was as sweet as you"

Chad Lehman writes:  The ep seems to be a rip on the sugar industry; but is it
   a satire of satire itself?  They compare the sugar industry to the
   narcotics industry, as well as evil corporate interests that endanger human
   health á là Erin Brockovich.  Silly; it seems to be more making fun of the
   currently popular "Sugar Busters" and "Atkins" diets, which proclaim sugar
   as the principal cause of obesity, hypertension, and other health problems.

   It seems the writers' opinion on the subject is that blaming sugar for
   America's health problems is silly.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Joe Green alterna-title for this episode is:  [DABF03] Citizen Sugarcane


Don Del Grande:  there's at least one actual record that has a "Mississippi"
   rule, sort of; when making a "champagne fountain" (a tower of champagne
   glasses with champagne poured from the top), it has to stay upright for six
   seconds after the champagne fills the glasses?


Russell Flowers:  I was going to ask how Burns knows so many vampires, but I
   realized it was a stupid question.

% interested in.

Ah, the full Leonard Nimoy cycle:  "I Am Not Spock," then "I Am 
Spock," and finally, "I Am Also Scotty."
-- Comic Book Guy, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Lisa takes a cart overflowing with books to the checkout register. 
% She's trying to save as many as possible, since the books nobody
% buys are used as feed for pigs.  Indeed, Cletus stands nearby,
% complaining that Helen Fieldings's novel gives his pigs "Bridget
% Jones's diarrhea."
%
% Marge finds a book even Homer might like -- the Duff Book of World
% Records.  Her instincts are right on; Homer thumbs through and
% giggles at the pictures of record-breaking deformities.

Bart:	Why would Duff Beer put out a book?
Lisa:	It was originally published to settle arguments in 
	taverns.
Homer:	She said, "tavern!"  I'm going to Moe's.  [runs out]
Marge:	[calls after him] I never agreed to that rule!
	[we hear tires screeching as a car leaves the parking lot]
-- Too late for take-backs, now, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Meanwhile at Moe's, Lenny and Carl are engaged in one of those
% arguments you only hear in a tavern (or maybe a college dormitory).

Lenny:	Well, I say the most clothespins a man could attach to his 
	face is 87.
Carl:	You counting the neck?
Lenny:	You know I am.
Carl:	All right -- outside.
	[suddenly, Homer appears at the door, bathed in golden 
	light.  He holds the Duff record book triumphantly over 
	his head]
Homer:	Peace, my brothers.  All shall be looked up.
	[leafs through the books] Let's see ... most clothespins 
	swallowed, inserted, here we go -- clipped to face and 
	neck: 116.  [shows a picture of a man with the pins on his 
	head.  He looks like a pin porcupine]
Lenny:	Oh.  Geez, I was wrong.  But I ain't angry.
Carl:	And I'm magnanimous in victory.
-- Duff Book of World Records saves the day!  "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Moe says that book is the best he's ever seen, but actually,
% according to the Duff people, the best book Moe's seen is Tom
% Clancy's "Op Center."
%
% Some time later, Homer's still enthralled by the book, but the
% novelty is wearing thin for the rest of his family.  Bart suggests
% that Homer try to set a new record of his own.  Homer first
% considers breaking the record for running the fastest mile,
% something Lisa thinks might be possible -- on Mars.
%
% Homer figures out a Plan B and shows up one day at the offices of
% Duff's World Record Division.  Some other record hopefuls -- a guy
% with extra-long fingernails and a man smoking dozens of cigarettes
% at once among them -- sit in the waiting room.

Homer:	[to a portly man who resembles Marlon Brando] You're a 
	cinch to be the world's fattest man.
Brando:	No, I'm here for the greatest living actor.
-- Awarded posthumously, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Homer meets the people who certify new records.

Homer:		I'm here to break a world's record.  What's the 
		longest anyone's ever done this?  [jumps around, 
		making goofy faces and noises]
Record Lady:	Three years.
Homer:		Fine.  I'll just play the banjo with this cobra.  
		[begins doing so, then hits a wrong note] Wait, 
		wait, wait!
Record Man:	[interrupting] Uh, technically the cobra would get 
		the record.  He's the one playing.
Homer:		But it's my banjo!
Record Lady:	Mr. Simpson, there are thousands of people like you 
		with no discernable talent.
Homer:		Yeah, they're called Congress.  [laughs]
Record Lady:	Shut up.
Homer:		Okay.
Record Man:	All the original records were set by crackpots who 
		half-killed themselves.  The only way someone new 
		can get in the book is with some kind of group 
		stunt.
Homer:		Group stunt?
Record Lady:	Like the town that made the world's largest omelet.
Homer:		Denver?
Record Lady:	No, Spanish.
		[ba-dum-bum!  Homer plays a banjo flourish]
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% If it's a group stunt that the Duff Record people want, it's a group
% stunt they'll get.  Homer gathers together as many townsfolk as he
% can, and announces his goal:  To set the record for world's tallest
% human pyramid.  The people are enthusiastic about the chance to give
% Springfield a *real* claim to fame, as opposed to their old claim
% about being the birthplace of the Beatles.
%
% Later, a huge pyramid of people rises on a vacant lot inside town. 
% Homer pauses briefly to make sure everything's going to plan.  (It's
% a pretty simple plan -- just a big triangle.)  Interestingly,
% Homer's knowledge of civil engineering and physics lead him to
% believe that the best place for a man of his physique is at the very
% top of the pyramid.  He starts to climb up, but gets exhausted
% halfway to the top.  At first, he proposes making a base camp there,
% and going for the top tomorrow, but the others in the pyramid will
% have none of that.  Bart yells that Homer can go for the title of
% World's Laziest Stunt Organizer.
%
% The taunt motivates Homer to climb the rest of the way.  It isn't an
% easy task.  Near the top, Homer tries to get a grip on Bumblebee
% Man's "stinger," but it breaks off, and Homer falls.  He breaks his
% fall halfway down by grabbing onto some fellow's foot, and then
% successfully climbs back to the top.
% 
% The Duff Record Lady measures the pyramid from a cherry picker's
% basket.  The townspeople are a foot shy of the record.  Homer
% snatches victory from defeat by putting Maggie on top of his head. 
% Now all the people have to do is hold the pyramid pose for "three
% Mississippis," and the record will be theirs!
%
% Unfortunately, two seconds later, Jimbo and Kearney realize their
% hands are touching.  Ew!  They recoil, and the sudden removal of
% support causes a chain reaction that collapses the whole pyramid and
% forms a giant ball of people.  The people-ball rolls down the hill,
% and nothing in its path can stop it.
%
% Meanwhile, a man in town prepares to jump off a ledge.

Man:	Goodbye, cruel world.
	[he jumps, and lands on the people-ball just as it passes by]
	Hello, ironic twist!
-- The world's most ironic twist, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% The townspeople land in a heap near a truck weighing station.  As
% they try to recover from their trip, the Record Man notices
% something interesting.  The total weight of the people is 64,152
% pounds (29098.858 kilograms).

Record Man:	Wait a minute -- look at the scale.
Record Lady:	[enters numbers into a calculator] Divide by the 
		number of people, subtract belts and shoes ...
Record Man:	[sees the answer] Oh!
		[to the people] Everyone, welcome to the Duff Book 
		of World Records.  Springfield is the world's 
		fattest town.
		[everyone cheers]
Homer:		Woo-hoo!  In your face, Milwaukee!
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  6:19]
%
% In light of their achievement, Mayor Quimby proclaims Springfield to
% be "Fat City, USA."  Most of the town is ecstatic, including Homer.

Now that everyone's so open about being fat, I can finally stop 
sucking in my gut.
-- Homer Simpson, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Marge isn't joining the celebration, though.  She wonders why the
% town is so obese.  Watching Homer and the kids at breakfast time, it
% dawns on her that they eat an awful lot of sugar.  Even when Homer
% eats a grapefruit, he dips it in a bag of sugar, and then licks it
% off before throwing the rest away.
%
% At the Kwik-E-Mart, Marge has little luck in finding healthier food
% for her family.

Marge:		[picking up a box of cereal] Look at all these empty 
		calories.  [sees a donut box] Ooh, sugar-free 
		donuts.
Apu:		No, that is sugar *with* free donuts.  [cut to 
		close-up of box so the audience can see that it 
		reads, "Sugar, Free Donuts"]
Marge:		Oh.  Apu, everything in this store is overloaded 
		with sugar.
Hibbert:	Marge has a point.  Sugar is not only fattening it's 
		also terribly, terribly addictive.  Uh, is my carton 
		of Pixy Stix in?
Apu:		No, it hasn't come in yet.
Hibbert:	[slams his fist on the counter] Dammit!  When they 
		come in, you call me at this number.  [hands Apu a 
		slip of paper and leaves]
Apu:		[reading] 9-1-1.
		[to Marge] I am sorry, but everything in this store 
		from the Honey-Glazed Cauliflower to the Choco-
		Blasted Baby Aspirin comes from the Motherloving 
		Sugar Corporation.
Marge:		Well, I'm going to have a talk with them.  Where are 
		their worldwide headquarters located?
Apu:		Why, right down the street.
Marge:		That's lucky.
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% The President of Motherloving Sugar, Garth Motherloving, goes over
% his schedule for the day (evil deeds and racquetball, mainly).  His
% plans are disrupted when Marge walks into his office.

Marge:	Excuse me, I'm looking for the head of Motherloving Sugar.
Garth:	Yes, I'm Garth Motherloving.
Marge:	I'm Marge Simpson, long-time customer, first-time 
	complainer.
Garth:	Hey, Marge, I'm not up on my slang, but do kids still say, 
	"Get the hell out of my office?"
Marge:	I want you to stop putting so much sugar into everything.  
	Or at least warn people that it's so unhealthy.
Garth:	Hmm, that'll boost sales!  While we're at it, why don't I 
	just change my name back to Hitler?
Marge:	Don't you have any sense of corporate responsibility?
Garth:	[confused puppy-dog whimpers]
Marge:	Hey!  [claps twice, and Garth snaps back to attention]
Garth:	Look, lady, take it up with your sewing circle, okay?
Marge:	But we're on hiatus, everyone's everywhere.
Garth:	[speaking into a hand-held tape recorder] Note to Marge:  
	Get out.  [takes the tape out and tosses it to Marge]
Marge:	[catches tape] I'll play it later.  [leaves]
-- Marge's corporate crusade begins, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Marge talks to her family about her visit to Motherloving Sugar.

Marge:	If you looked up "meany-beany-fo-feenie" in the 
	dictionary, you'd see his picture.
Homer:	Wait -- you went to a sugar factory?  Were there Oompa-
	Loompas?
Marge:	There was one in a cage, but he wasn't moving.
Homer:	[disappointed] Aw.
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Marge continues.

Marge:	That company's ruining the whole town's health, and I 
	don't know how to stop them.
Lisa:	Why don't you file a class-action suit?
Marge:	Oh, yeah, like Erin Brockovich.
Bart:	The prostitute with a heart of gold.
-- Careful, or she might file a defamation suit,
    "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% A lawsuit requires a lawyer.  As she and Lisa ride in the family
% station wagon, Marge says doesn't think she can afford a lawyer. 
% Lisa says that's no problem.  Thanks the prodigious rate at which
% law schools graduate new attorneys, legal representation is cheaper
% than ever before.  As she says this, wanna-be lawyers swarm all over
% the car, begging to take Marge's case.  Marge quickly chooses Gil,
% whose new law degree allows him to both try cases and wipe Marge's
% windshield.
%
% Marge, Lisa, and Gil meet to discuss their legal strategy.  To
% launch a class-action suit against the sugar industry, they'll have
% to take depositions door-to-door.  Gil recuses himself from that
% job; he made too many enemies in his days as a door-to-door
% salesman.  The task falls to Marge.  First, she visits Chief Wiggum,
% who signs because he think sugar has made his son Ralph hyperactive. 
% "I'm happy and angry," the boy says.
%
% Next stop, Cletus's shack.

Cletus:		Oh, shoot, I'll sign.  Figure those sugar folks owe 
		me for what they done to my cousin, [opens a door to 
		reveal a fat woman on the floor] Diabetty.
Diabetty:	I'm trying to slim down so I can fit into Momma's 
		coffin.  [does a stretching exercise, and takes a 
		big bite of cake] That's my re-ward!
Marge:		[looks vaguely disgusted] Ohhh.
-- Ms. Brockovich didn't have it this tough, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Cletus signs his name to the petition in beautiful calligraphic
% script.
%
% Finally, Marge visits Disco Stu who signs because he got "hooked on
% the White Stuff" in the 70s.  He slurps a line of sugar off the
% coffee table, as if it were cocaine, and puts on a disco record. 
% Marge apprehensively backs out the door.
%
% Marge comes home to find Homer sitting at the dining room table. 
% He's wearing a nice suit, but looks angry.

Marge:	Oh.  Hi, Homer.
Homer:	Well, well, if it isn't the woman who's too busy saving 
	the world to save her own marriage.
Marge:	What are you talking about?  [indicates a tureen] Is that 
	dinner?
Homer:	[lifts the lid, revealing a meatloaf that's burned to a 
	crisp] It was dinner.
Marge:	Why didn't you just turn off the oven?
Homer:	I was hoping we could do that together.  [runs out, 
	crying.  Then he runs back, grabs the meatloaf, and runs 
	out again]
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Later, the phone rings.

Marge:	[answering the phone] Hello?
Frink:	Marge Simpson?
Marge:	Who is this?
	[cut to the other end of the line, where a man speaks into 
	a device to disguise his voice]
Frink:	I'm an anonymous whistle-blower.  I worked on a top-secret 
	project called Operation Hoyven-Mayven.
Marge:	Professor Frink?
Frink:	Oh, what gave it away, out of curiosity?  Was it the 
	"hoyven" or the "mayven" or the whole "g'hoy-veen" thing 
	that I do?
-- You had me at "hoyven," "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% The trial begins.  Prof. Frink gives his testimony.

Gil:	So, Professor, tell us about Operation Hoyven-Mayven.
Frink:	Well, we knew perfectly well it was addictive.  Candy was 
	just a sugar delivery system.  We thought we were God, 
	hoyven-mayven.
Garth:	Frink, you little weasel.  I'll kill you!
Lawyer:	May I remind you we're in open court?
Garth:	I'll kill you, too!  I'll kill you all!
Judge:	Mr. Motherloving, that could be interpreted as a threat.
Garth:	I'll kill you while you sleep.
Lawyer:	Objection!
Judge:	I'll allow it.
-- A star witness -- for the prosecution, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% A cartoon-y looking vampire is the next man to testify.

Gil:	Now, Count Fudgula, how long were you spokes-vampire for 
	Motherloving Breakfast Cereal?
Count:	Twenty of your mortal years.  But I had to quit when my 
	fangs succumbed to gingivitis.  [takes out a set of fang 
	dentures] Now, all my victims have to be mashed up.
	[the people in the courtroom make a sympathetic noise]
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Garth Motherloving approaches the bench.

Garth:	Your honor, I admit it looks bad for me, but I think you 
	might be turned around by some surprising taste-imony.
	[he pushes an attaché case toward Judge Snyder, and opens 
	it.  Inside is a tempting array of candy]
Judge:	[closes the case] Sir, this is a house of justice, not a 
	sugar shack.  It's Hershey highwaymen like you who made me 
	fat.
Lawyer:	Well, your honor, the court carries it well.
Judge:	Silence!  I rule in favor of Marge Simpson.  [the 
	courtroom crowd cheers]
Homer:	[to Marge] I am so proud of you.
Judge:	And thanks to Marge Simpson's damning evidence, I hereby 
	ban all sugar products from Springfield, forever.  [bangs 
	gavel]
Homer:	[to Marge, angrily] Get in the car.
-- Be careful what you sue for, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:57]
%
% Kent Brockman reads the evening news.

Kent:	Tonight's top story, Springfield's cake-hole has been shut 
	forever.  In what has been dubbed, Marge's Law, all forms 
	of sugar are now illegal.
Homer:	[to Marge] Thank you, Erin Choco-snitch.  That was a group 
	effort.
Marge:	I'm just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
Homer:	Well, good work Blue Hair and Brocko-witch.  [everyone 
	stares at Homer] Okay, that was mine.
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Kent goes on to list all the sugary snacks that are now verboten in
% Springfield.  Even medical sugar pills must go, to be replaced with
% highly concentrated opium.
%
% To comply with the new law, the police burn all the sugar snacks in
% a huge bonfire.  Well, everything except Butterfinger candy bars,
% which the fire "spits" back out.
%
% Some people find it harder than others to obey the new law.  The
% lawn at Springfield Elementary is covered with children suffering
% from wicked sugar withdrawal.  Principal Skinner and Groundskeeper
% Willie walk among the kids.

Jimbo:	Sugar ... need sugar ...
Willie:	[to Skinner] Aye, they're not riding the white horse 
	anymore.
Ralph:	My baby ... where's my baby?
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% The shelves at the Kwik-E-Mart have been stripped almost bare. 
% Homer frantically searches for his sugar fix.

Homer:	[searches the shelves] Nothing left ... nothing left.  
	[notices a dark stain on the floor] A sticky spot!  [bends 
	down and starts licking it]
Apu:	Mr. Simpson, you're licking blood and Vapo-Rub.
Homer:	[stands up] Part of me knew that.
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Apu thinks Homer might be the right man to join a group dedicated to
% bringing sugar back to Springfield by any means necessary.  The two
% head out to the Lard Lad donut hut.  The Lard Lad statue has a
% secret entrance to an underground lair.  Homer and Apu arrive to
% find Motherloving, Mr. Burns, and Count Fudgula sitting at a
% conference table.

Apu:	Gentlemen, I have found the final member of our cabal.
Homer:	Count Fudgula?  I thought you wanted to get off the stuff.
Count:	I'm a monster; don't look at me!  [shields himself with 
	his cape and hisses]
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% The group enlists Homer's help in smuggling sugar from "south of the
% border."  Not Tennessee, as Homer guesses, but the island of San
% Glucose.
%
% The next day, Homer and Bart dress in dark clothing and head out for
% the mission.  Lisa meets them at the door before they leave.

Lisa:	Is it really worth risking your lives just for some sugar?
Marge:	[off-screen] Dessert's on!  I steamed some limes!
Lisa:	[to Homer] Godspeed.
-- Not as appetizing as steamed hams, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% The sugar cabal's ship reaches San Glucose.  Homer, dressed in scuba
% gear, dives over the rail only land on one of the lower decks.  He
% tries again, and this time lands on a whale.  The third time's the
% charm.  He hits the water and swims over to the beach.

Count:	How's he doing?
Bart:	[looking through binoculars] I think he's grossed out by 
	some seaweed.
Homer:	[over the walkie-talkie] Ew, I touched it.  Over.
Burns:	Get a grip, Simpson.  You're doing fine.  Now, do you have 
	your map?
	[cut to the island.  Homer and a toucan play tug-of-war 
	over the map]
Homer:	Kinda.  [to the bird] C'mon, give it!
	[aside] I know, I'll try reverse psychology.  [lets go]
	[to the bird] I don't want that stupid map!  [the bird 
	flies away with the map, and Homer gasps]
	D'oh!
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Despite not having a map, Homer meets up with the sugar dealers. 
% They load up a rubber raft with sacks of sugar.

Dealer:	Okay, man, here's the sugar.  Now you give us the money.
Homer:	[pushes off in the raft] That wasn't part of the deal.  
	[laughs]
Dealer:	[consults the contract] He's right.  [to his henchmen] Who 
	wrote this thing!?
-- Always read the fine print, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% The cabal return to Springfield's port.  Homer asks everyone if they
% "keistered" their personal supply, but is answered only with strange
% looks.
%
% Suddenly, the police intercept the cabal boat and give them an
% ultimatum:  Surrender or be sunk.  Homer is defiant, but everyone
% else (except Bart) rows away in a dinghy.

Homer:	Remember what I told you about running away from your 
	troubles?
Bart:	Yeah.
Homer:	Let's do it.
-- Homer puts fatherly advice into practice, "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Homer speeds off and the police give chase.  Up ahead, two men, each
% in a boat, ferry a large sheet of glass; each man grips one side. 
% Homer's boat is small enough to duck under the glass.  The police
% have to break off the chase and veer to the left.  Now, they're
% bearing down on a woman and her baby riding a personal watercraft. 
% Wiggum makes another sharp turn and beaches the boat.  Satisfied
% with the outcome of the chase, he says he likes to think he's made a
% difference for the day.
%
% Having eluded the long arm of the law, Homer arrives at the dock. 
% Garth Motherloving is waiting for him there, with a forklift.

Garth:	Good work, Simpson.
Homer:	Before I bring the sugar in, I want to see the Oompa-
	Loompa.
Garth:	He's right over there.  [points to an Oompa-Loompa, who's 
	sitting quietly and smoking a cigarette]
Homer:	[aside to Bart] That guy is freaky.
	[to Garth] Well, here's your sugar.
Marge:	[standing on another pier] No, Homer!  You'll be 
	condemning this town to a life of obesity and diabetes.
Garth:	Don't listen to her, Homer!
Homer:	Ooh, they both make good arguments.
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Marge makes one last desperate plea for Homer to dump the sugar. 
% Homer's hand hovers between two buttons, one to dump the sugar and
% the other labeled, "Obey Bad Guy."  After a moment's consideration,
% Homer does the right thing and dumps his cargo into the bay. 
% Defeated, Motherloving backs away in his forklift.
%
% Some townspeople milling around by the dock can't help but notice
% that the water is now full of sugar.  A crowd immediately jumps in
% for a dip and a snack.

Cap'n:	Aye, 'tis a sugary brine.
Moe:	[takes a bite out of a small shark] This sugar shark is 
	delicious.  [the shark bites Moe] Ow, hey!  He bit me 
	back!  [grabs the shark out of the water and stares it 
	down] So that's how it's going to be, eh?
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% Marge is dismayed by what she sees.  Judge Snyder comes by with an
% inner tube.

Marge:	Everybody looks so happy.
Judge:	Indeed, Marge.  And, uh, now that I think of it, I wildly 
	exceeded my authority, and I declare the sugar ban over.  
	[jumps in the water]
Bart +
 Lisa:	Can we, Mom, can we?  Please, please, please?
Marge:	Oh, all right.  But take Maggie with you.  [hands Maggie 
	to Lisa]
	[the kids jump in the water]
	I guess you just can't use the law to nag.  Maybe I should 
	just stop trying to change the world.
Homer:	No, Marge, I love when you do that.  You're a regular 
	Karen A-Lot-Ovich.
Marge:	Oh, that's the best one.
Homer:	That's what I told Lisa!
-- "Sweets and Sour Marge"

% The camera pans down to the water.  Lenny comes to the surface,

Lenny:	Hey, I found some pearls!  [looks closer] No, wait,
