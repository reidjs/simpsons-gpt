Stacey Fielding (an665@cleveland.Freenet.Edu) observes:

It wasn't just that is said "I will not grease the monkey bars."
It was the way it was arranged on the chalkboard:

           I will not grease the monkey
           bars.

...that lead me to believe we now have our first Simpson's 
masturbation reference.  Well, Bart <is> getting close to that age.
===============================================================================
The `Monroe Box' is a spoof of B. F. Skinner's controversial `Skinner Box'.
I'm sorry I didn't mention this the first time I posted the article; I assumed
that everybody was familiar with it.

> Quotes and scene summary
===============================================================================
% The family drop Grampa off at the retirement home after another miserable
% `third Sunday of the month' outing with Grampa.  Marge scolds them for
% not treating Grampa with respect.

Marge: You know, <we'll> be old someday.
Homer: Gasp!  My God, you're right, Marge!  You kids wouldn't put me in a home
       like I did to my dad, would you?
Bart:  [considering the idea] Well...
Homer: Aaah!
-- After another miserable Sunday with Grampa, ``Old Money''

% The family debate what they should do next month, and after some debate,
% all agree to go to Discount Lion Safari.  Grampa returns to his room, then
% goes downstairs for his pills.  His pills are mixed up with those of
% Bea Simmons, and the two hit it off.  They eat their pills seductively...

Well, I was wondering if you and I you know, might go to the same place
at the same time and... Jeez!  You'd think this would get easier with time!
-- Grampa asks Bea Simmons out, ``Old Money''

% Grampa preens himself for his date, and they go dancing, and lots of other
% stuff.  Grampa goes to Herman to buy Bea a birthday gift, and Herman points
% him at Grandma's World...

Yo, active wear?  Need a price check on a wool shoal.
-- Clerk at `Grandma's World', ``Old Money''

% Homer pays Grampa a visit on the third Sunday of the month, and when Grampa
% says it's his girlfriend Bea's birthday, Homer greets an empty chair
% (thinking Grampa's friend is imaginary) and drags Grampa out.  They take
% him to Discount Lion Safari...

Do not feed the animals.  Do not allow animals inside the car.
Do not make eye contact with animals.
-- Lisa reads the instruction pamphlet for Discount Lion Safari, ``Old Money''

% They wander off the official route, get stuck in the mud, and are attacked
% by lions.  The next morning, the lions are scared off by a gunshot...

Mr. Simpson, I presume.

% Grampa returns home to see the paramedics taking Bea's body away.

You know, Jasper, they may say she died of a burst ventricle, but I know
she died of a broken heart.
-- Grampa mourns Bea's passing, ``Old Money''

% At the funeral...

You can tell she really cared for me.  She didn't make me a pallbearer.
-- Grampa watches the pallbearers struggle with the casket, ``Old Money''

Homer:  I can't tell you how sorry I am, Dad.
Grampa: Is someone talking to me?  I didn't hear anything.
Homer:  Oh no!  Dad's lost his hearing!
-- Grampa disowns Homer, ``Old Money''

% In his room, Grampa is greeted by Lionel Hutz, the executor of Bea's estate,
% and learns she left everything to him.

Hutz:   There is one catch...  You must spend one night in... a haunted house!
Grampa: [gasp!]
Hutz:   Just kidding.
-- Grampa inherits $106,000, ``Old Money''

Why don't I just give you this pen with my phone number on it.  It looks
just like a cigar.  Isn't that something!
-- Lionel Hutz leaves a calling card, ``Old Money''

% Grampa phones Homer to tell him he isn't getting one thin dime.  The
% home director makes a play for the money, and Grampa throws him out.

Grampa:   Has it ever occurred to you that old folks deserve to be treated
          like human beings! whether they have money or not?
Director: Yes, but it passes.
-- The retirement home director tries to get his hands on... ``Old Money''

% Grampa returns to Herman's and buys a fez, allegedly once worn by Napoleon.
% He goes to various `exciting' places and yawns at each.  While at
% Dis-nee-land ...

Oh, Abraham, calm down.  I'm not here to scare you.  They've got me haunting
a family in Texas.
-- Bea's ghost appears, ``Old Money''

% She suggests that, since he isn't enjoying the money, he give it to a worthy
% cause.  Meanwhile, Marge suggests that Homer talk to somebody about his
% depression...

Hiya.  You have reached Doctor Marvin Monroe's anxiety line.
If you have a sullen teenager, press `1'.. NOW!
If you are estranged from your spouse, press `2'... NOW!
If you have trouble maintaining an...
-- ``Old Money''

% Grampa pays a surprise visit, and the two reconcile.  Over dinner, Grampa
% announces that he's going to interview for worthy causes for Bea's money.
% Outside the retirement home, Kent Brockman does his news report.  Inside
% Grampa listens to pitches from Otto, Mr. Burns, Moe, Dr. Marvin Monroe...

Monroe: It's a special isolation chamber.  The subject pulls levers to receive
        food and water.  The floor can become electrified, and showers of
        icy water randomly fall on the subject.  I call it... The Monroe Box!
Grampa: Uh huh.  Sounds interesting.  How much will it cost to build?
Monroe: Oh, that's the beauty part!  It's already built!  I need the money
        to buy a baby to raise in the box until the age of thirty.
Grampa: What are you trying to prove?
Monroe: Well, my theory is that the subject will be socially maladjusted and
        will harbor a deep resentment towards me.
Grampa: Mm.  Interesting.
-- Everybody wants to get their hands on... ``Old Money''

% from Bart, a crazy inventor with a death ray...

Man:    With proper funding, I'm confident this little baby could destroy
        an area the size of New York City.
Grampa: But I want to help people, not kill them!
Man:    Oh.  Well, to be honest, the ray only has <evil> applications...
-- Everybody wants to get their hands on... ``Old Money''

% and even Lisa...

Lisa:   The people who deserve it are on the streets, and they're in the slums.
        They're little children who need more library books, and they're
        families who can't make ends meet.  Of course, if you really wanted
        to, you could buy me a pony.
Grampa: You're right!
Lisa:   I'll name her Princess, and I'll ride her every day!
-- Lisa suggests how Grampa could spend his... ``Old Money''

% Grampa realizes Lisa is right and takes a walk through the run-down part
% of town.  He returns to the retirement home and realizes that $100,000
% isn't enough.  Jasper suggests going to the casino.  While Otto drives
% the bus of old elderly folk, Homer chases after it.  As Grampa changes
% his money into chips, Homer pulls into a Krusty Burger...

Homer: A double cheeseburger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and
       for God's sakes, hurry!
Voice: [unintelligible, thanks to the poor-quality microphone]
-- The drive-through window of a Krusty Burger, ``Old Money''

% Homer arrives at the casino and finds that Grampa is actually winning.

Grampa: I think Rudyard Kipling said it best:  If you can make one heap
        of all your winnings and risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
        and lose, and start again at your beginnings, and never breathe
        a word about your loss, yours is the earth is everything that is
        in it, and, which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
Homer:	You'll be a bonehead!
-- Trying to stop Grampa from risking it all at the casino, ``Old Money''

Grampa: Put it all on 41.  [nudges Homer] I've got a feeling about that number.
Roulette man:  The wheel only goes to 36.
Grampa: Okay, put it all on 36.
        [nudges Homer] I've got a feeling about that number.
-- Grampa at the casino, ``Old Money''

% Homer successfully stops Grampa from risking (and losing) everything.
% Grampa sees his friends piling onto the bus for the ride home and decides
% where his money should go:  He spends it on sprucing up the Springfield
% Retirement Castle and creating the Beatrice Simmons Dining Room.
