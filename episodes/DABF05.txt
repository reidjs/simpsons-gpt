> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   [SNPP.com] Homer breaks his jaw in an accident, requiring it to be wired
   shut for a month.  His resulting inability to talk makes him a better
   listener, and he becomes closer to family and friends because of it.  They
   all like the new Homer much better, but when the wires come off and Homer
   retains his new attitude, everyone begins to miss the old Homer's antics.

Blackboard:     None

Couch:          The living room is rendered in black and white, and we can
                hear the sound of an old-fashioned projector in the
                background.  Homer enters the scene, dressed as Charlie
                Chaplin's Little Tramp character.  As he pauses, the rest of
                the family, dressed in period hobo costumes, runs to the
                couch.  Then, Homer sidles up to the couch, and sits down.

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... the voices for the "Stayin' in the closet" float sound like Smithers
       (no big surprise) and Patty?

Bojan Bugarin:
   ... when Homer is selling the ostrich-burgers, there is no price or
       anything?
   ... Bart never pays for the beer?

Santino Ciofani:
   ... that Dr. Hibbert does not hold the X-Ray with both thumbs as in HOMR?

Don Del Grande:
   ... this is the second couch opening in black and white?
   ... at the parade, Maggie has a pink triangle balloon?
   ... Homer spells it "D'oh!"?
   ... that's the most Maggie has "said" in quite a while?
   ... everybody else waltzed in a circle around Homer and Marge?
   ... when the Demolition Derby started, everybody started driving in a
       figure eight (and nobody hit anybody else while doing it)?

Daniel Dreibelbis:
   ... Homer seems to have gotten over most of his homophobia, judging by his
       reactions to the Gay Pride Parade?
   ... Rocko was on the Gay Steel Workers Float?
   ... Barney sober at Moe's and with a coffee cup?
   ... it appears OFF's station wagon is a total write-off now?  (any bets on
       if it will ever return, and if it does, will it still keep its damage
       like the sedan has since "The People Of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"?)

Joe Green:
   ... "Dude, Where's My Pepsi?" is playing at the multiplex?

Tony Hill:
   ... Homer erased "YES" from the board and then rewrote "YES"?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the usual TV screen music starts right in the middle of the couch gag?
   ... Smithers is now officially considered a homosexual (though in the
       closet)?
   ... Dana Gould appears in the "also starring" credits?

Chad Lehman:
   ... Homer's "KO" sounds just like a ringside bell?
   ... this is the second episode in a row with a suicide gag?
   ... this is the second episode in a row that Marge uses "for ME?" on Homer?
   ... Hibbert waits until Homer has the headgear attached before telling him
       he suffered a broken jaw?  (Maybe Homer was unconscious for the
       procedure)
   ... Homer immediately gets his comeuppance for being "jerky"?  After he
       punches the ostrich, it punches him back quite a few times.

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... the patches on Maggie's "baggie" in the couch gag?
   ... the moustaches painted on the haz-mat suits for the "safe sex" float?

James Troupe:
   ... during the Itchy and scratchy short, one of the bunnies from the "Life
       in Hell" comic were sitting behind the two?
   ... a cleaned up-looking Nelson Muntz (Much like in episode 4F01, "Lisa's
       Date with Density") was sitting behind Homer in the theater?
   ... the Phone number on the movie screen was KLN-5555, which is actually
       556-5555 instead of the normal 555-5555?
   ... the crayon from Episode BABF22, "HOMR," is still in Homer's head when
       they show the X-Ray of his head?
   ... the beer vendor gave Bart a beer without any hesitation?

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Bojan Bugarin:  I found this episode very amusing (it will certainly be one of
   my favorites), but the final grade is A (not A+ because some gags when I
   watched them for the second time were not funny anymore).  I'm glad that
   Homer is united with his brain (for a change) and his thinking is of a
   normal person (well, at least 90% of the time).  The good thing is that, as
   always, at the end he's himself again.  It would be very disturbing to see
   a "sane" Homer next week.  (A)

Santino Ciofani:  The gay pride parade yielded no reaction at all from me,
   which somewhat set the tone for the episode.  Of course, there were obvious
   plot problems.  The first act is usually different from the second, but not
   the second from the third.  I got some laughs, mostly from subtle things,
   but then there were tasteless jokes like Homer muttering "I'm horny." and
   donkeys popping up out of nowhere.  I also doubt that demolition derbies
   take anyone to drive in them.  Grade:  (C)

Don Del Grande:  Usually I'm not much of a fan of the "three part stories"
   separated by the commercials (Homer and the movies; Homer with his jaw
   shut; Marge in the demolition derby), but the bit with Homer's jaw stood
   out, and the animation junkie in me liked the Popeye bit as well (right
   down to the music and Marge's flailing arms).  (B+)

Daniel Dreibelbis:  One of the biggest complaints people had during the Mike
   Scully era was Homer being too much of a jerk, a cretin, and being way too
   wacky, and here the plot takes these complaints and puts them on their ear
   by having Homer cured of his bad faults completely, only to have him become
   a flat, lifeless character that even Marge doesn't like.  It does seem to
   drive home the fact that, as much as we like to see Homer be mature, it's
   his childlike and wrong-headedness behavior that really makes him funny.
   But Homer does get to shine in this episode, [...] and hey, we even got
   some Maggie interaction!  Unfortunately, we also have some problems left
   over from the Scully era that look like they're going to take some time to
   weed out, like the shocking sex gags ( "Soccer Mummy", Moe's escort service
   call).  (A-)

Alex Foley:  It's good to see that the writers can still make an OFF episode
   with a strong story and strong jokes.  When I first heard about this
   episode, I figured Homer would soon cause wacky hijinks so he could get his
   jaw brace off, but instead we get a Homer that can care but at the same
   time still be Homer (i.e. feel for Bart, but still be able to laugh about
   it).  Same for the rest of OFF. Bart was Bart, Lisa was Lisa, and Marge was
   Marge without being a complete nag. Yet, they didn't have to sacrifice the
   humor at the same time (Gay Pride Parade, I & S return, Homer and his
   Ostrich Burgers, The Popeye send-off, etc.).  Best episode of the season so
   far.  (A-)

Joe Green:  This is one of my favorite Season 13 episodes so far.  We got to
   see some genuine character development, not only with the "nice" Homer but
   with some other characters making pronouncements to him.  I enjoyed the
   bulk of this so much that for once, a goofy ending didn't really bother me.
   (A-)

Tony Hill:  This one was actually pretty good, although it's another of the
   "3-plotters" we've had to get used to lately.  Whatever happened to having
   a main plot and a subplot?  All in all, it was pretty predictable, but I
   give it a  (B-)

Sam Law:  A not so good episode.  Great scene though, where Homer sucks the
   meat up his nose.  This is one of my least favourite Season 13 Episodes.  I
   give it a  (C-)

Ted Schuerzinger:  I liked the first two acts more than the third, which
   seemed over the top.  I didn't particularly like the send-up of Popeye,
   since it's something that doesn't really seem like fertile material for the
   Simpsons' brand of satire.  (With the exception of Marge being compared to
   Olive Oyl.)  The show had some good sight gags, especially involving Maggie
   -- how nice to see Maggie get a big role again, especially in something
   better than the awful "Hello Gutter, Hello Father".  I give it a  (B+)

Todd Willis:  This episode started out being very, very entertaining.  The gay
   pride parade was thoroughly entertaining and the movie theater scenes were
   well done too. The show starts its slow descent downhill with the stupid
   contrived way Homer breaks his jaw.  While it wasn't as bad as his knee
   injury in "Children of A Lesser Clod", it was still pretty terrible.  The
   second act was average and provided a few nice chuckles around the Simpson
   house.  [...]  The third act was horrendous with the worst TV show parody
   ever (morning yak or whatever it was), and went even further downhill with
   Marge entering the demolition derby and the Popeye jokes.  On the plus side
   the first act was gold and there were some good laughs throughout.  Also
   the Homer character wasn't wacky or overly stupid.  Decent effort, but the
   worst Al Jean episode so far.  (C-)

Stephen X:  Not a bad episode, but things moved too S--l---o-----w for my
   tastes.  I think I laughed out loud once, and sadly enough, it was at one
   of the Popeye references.  Homer as a nice guy who cares about his kids is
   really nothing interesting or enjoyable to watch.  Think of episodes like
   "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" where Homer shows his own personal
   style of caring for his kids while at the same time having his
   rough-around-the-edges personality.  Why is it that the show has to make
   Homer one person or the other when making an episode?  Well, I doubt this
   ep will hold up that well in syndication, tonight I will give it a  (B)

Aaron Yam:  Well, it wasn't the worst ever, it was a real solid effort. I was
   surprised at the number of sex related jokes, and [at] the "soccer mummy"
   scene I did a double take and thought, "did they just say that?"  Although,
   I do that at least 5 times a "Family Guy" episode.  Homer trying to eat
   steak was funny, and so was the Duffman routine.  I think Duffman should
   get his own hour show when "The Chamber" gets canceled.  (B-)

Yours Truly:  Watching this episode, it's hard to avoid thinking that the
   writers are saying a too-nice Homer is as bad as a too-mean one.  True, but
   this episode is actually a good argument for a just-right Homer:  One who
   is wacky enough to hold interest, and nice enough to gain the viewers'
   sympathy.  It's also funny throughout, with the gay parade and endless
   movie preview sequences the highlights.  It took a while, but Jaws Wired
   Shut" is this season's first really good episode.  (A)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B (3.04)   Std Dev.: 0.7938   (13 reviews computed)

>> Meta-reference Corner

Ted Schuerzinger:  Is this the first time Smithers has actually admitted to
   being gay? (Well, he's in the closet, but it's obviously his voice.  And
   could the scene with John in "Homer's Phobia" be considered an admission of
   homosexuality?  Everything else about Smithers' sexuality has been double-
   entendres.)

   The whole question of Homer's not being the live wire could (and certainly
   will be by a lot of other a.t.s-er's besides me!) be thought of as the
   writers' answering hardcore fans' call for a less wacky Homer.  The writers
   (intelligently, IMO) decide to show an utterly unwacky [sic] Homer, much
   the same way the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons became boring when Marge got
   them to be nonviolent in "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge".  At least one poster
   (Benjamin Robinson?) has posited that the writers are doing this sort of
   thing deliberately in an attempt to show us fans that we have it better
   than we think.  (At least, I think that's Benjamin's opinion.  [It was,
   essentially -- Ed.])  In the previous DABF episodes, they did a poor job of
   it, if that is indeed what they were trying to do.  In this episode,
   however, they did a better job of it.

Daniel Dreibelbis:  Ed O'Neill star of the "Soccer Mummy" trailer) is best
   remembered for starring as shoe salesman and dysfunctional-family patriarch
   Al Bundy on the once-controversial Fox sitcom "Married ... with Children
   (1987-1994).  As "Soccer Mummy" suggests, his feature film career has been
   largely limited to such forgettable "family" movies as "Dutch" and "Little
   Giants".  [{dd} adds, "[a] movie he did with John Travolta over a year ago
   sank like a stone" -- Ed.]

   Edward Albee is best known for his 1960s play "Who's Afraid of Virginia
   Woolf?".  His plays tend to revolve around hostile, short-tempered people,
   so it's not so much of a stretch that he'd write a play called "I'm Gonna
   Kill You".

>> The Boner Scene:  Good parody or bad joke?

The "Soccer Mummy" trailer, and in particular the joke where the mummy gets
   aroused, sparked some controversy in the alt.tv.simpsons newsgroup.  Was
   this a good parody of low-brow movies, or were the writers wallowing in
   low-brow humor themselves?

   the boner sound effect.  Save it for Family Guy.


Chad Lehman replies:  People seem to be missing the satire.  It mocks all
   those stupid movies; by going a step further that movies like "The Mighty
   Ducks" and that baseball one (with Keanu Reeves), it shows how stupid and
   crappy they are.  While movies like "Mighty Ducks" make it on fart jokes,
   the highlight of "Soccer Mummy" is a boner joke.

   Many folks on ATS were fooled, thinking that the literal joke (boner) was
   what "Jaws Wired Shut" was going for.  The stupid movie, coupled with the
   exaggeratedly bad/contrived plot, and Homer's laugh deliver the satire.
   Only simpletons enjoy those kinds of movies, and especially those type of
   jokes.  Again ... the Simpsons is _mocking_ those movies; not celebrating
   them.  Satire 101.  If you can't or won't understand that ... you just
   don't understand the foundation of classic Simpsons humor.

   Get it?  Why does Hollywood make these movies?  Somebody must really like
   them.  (Homer's type of people -- dumbass Americans.)  It's a caustic mock
   of that Hollywood crap.  Ever seen "The Big Green" or "Angels in the
   Outfield"?  How many fart jokes were there?  A "boner" joke is simply an
   exaggeration of the type of joke these movies make.


Rick Gutleber isn't convinced:  Oh, I got it.  And I still didn't think it was
   funny.

   I guess because as soon as I saw the boobs, and I was cringing, hoping they
   wouldn't go there.  Compare season 13 with season 1.  How crude does the
   show need to get?  Seeing as how the funniest gags in this episode were
   non-offensive (well, OK "Stop banging my wife!" wasn't, but at least that
   was funny), I don't see why the writers have to constantly prove what they
   can get away with.  And by writers, I mean Network TV writers for almost
   every show out there.


Joshua:  I also agree 100% [with Chad Lehman].  As is the Simpson way, the
   preview sequence was designed to *make fun of* movies.  That portion of the
   episode was intended to impugn the movie-making industry, not advocate it.
   As such, this particular joke served its purpose quite well, and that's why
   I enjoyed it.


Jim Dyer:  Is the humor level anywhere near, say, the time Flanders was all
   worried about going off half-cocked?  I think not.  Worst boner joke ever.


"Internet King":  Was it not "up" to your standards?


>> Maybe he'll eat his shorts, too

About Tyson's "eat his children" quote, Bob Vesterman writes:  I just looked
   up the actual quote, which has an unintentionally funny ending

   "My style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable and I'm just ferocious.
   I want your heart.  I want to eat your children.  Praise be to Allah."


"Stembolt" adds:  For some reason, the last line (the punch line, IMO) of the
   tirade was cut from some of the later reporting.  You would see the tape
   stop after the "eat your children" line.

   Anyway, the way he said "Praise be to Al-LAH!" was like "In your FACE!" or
   some similar taunt.


>> Suicide Machine

Joe Klemm:  Created by Jack Kevorkian, the Suicide Machine is a controversial
   item that he uses on his patients.  A patient who simply to die rather than
   suffer the pain of his/her illness would strap her self in the machine and
   have a needle put inside of him/her.  Then, with the press of a button,
   lethal materials would then be injected into him/her, thus leading to
   death.


>> "All the disclaimers just made me want to do it more!"

Joe Klemm writes:  Jackass is TV show that airs/ed on MTV.  The premise of the
   show featured a crew of guys pulling off some ridiculous and mostly
   dangerous stunts (i.e. a human barbecue, rigging a car to make it seem that
   a kidnapped guy is tied up in the trunk).  Obviously, some kids, despite
   the warnings that the show gives, attempt these stunts or variations of the
   stunts, and of course this leads to injury.  [{dd} calls it, "A Darwin
   Award waiting to happen" -- Ed.]


>> "Duffman will never die, only the actors who play him"

Daniel Drebelbis explains:  [This is] a poke at the fact that many well-loved
   corporate mascots have been played by a variety of people, most notably
   Ronald Macdonald, and, probably more pointedly, the Marlboro Man (one of
   the Marlboro Man actors did die from lung cancer, after he won a  lawsuit
   he launched at RJR Tobacco).


>> "Afternoon Yak"

Daniel Drebelbis writes:  The television talk show Homer appears on with Marge
   to talk about his change is a direct parody of this daytime talk show
   created by Barbara Walters for ABC to talk about women and women's issues,
   though sometimes it seems more like it's four grown women dishing the dirt
   on national TV.  Indeed, the four women in the parody are direct parodies
   of the women on the show, including Walters (right down to her slight
   speech impediment), Joy Behar (right down to Brooklyn accent) and Starr
   Jones (she actually does make those sort of "right on, sister!"
   pronouncements).


>> "You told me we were going to Red Lobster!"

Daniel Dreibelbis explains that this is a:  North American chain of seafood
   restaurants, offering items like "bottomless buckets of crab!" (Although
   the chain has its detractors, referring to its quality as "Red Latex.")


>> See our ad in "Demo Derby Times!"

Joe Green explains:  "Faces of Death" was a notorious 1978 B-movie that was
   allegedly a collection of actual footage of people being killed in various
   grotesque manners, although since then it's become widely accepted (and
   even the film's producers now admit this) that most of the "deaths" were
   faked.  "Faces of Death" has spawned a number of sequels, and the series
   enjoys a cult following among the kind of unsophisticated people who would
   show up for a demolition derby.


>> I'm Homer the drinkin' man!

Daniel Dreibelbis:  The popular comic strip creation of Elzie Segar's -- a
   one-eyed, cynical, scrawny sailor with a heart of gold and prone to
   violence -- took on added life in the 1930s when the Max Fleischer Studios
   began producing a series of theatrical cartoons, which were noted for their
   wit, brilliant dialogue, incredible animation techniques, and above all,
   the golden voice talents of Jack Mercer as Popeye and Mae Questal as
   Popeye's scrawny love interest Olive Oyl.


>> On the cutting room floor

"Hans the Moleman" reports:  Matt Selman went to my school to talk about
   writing the Simpsons.  I asked about cut out jokes.  He knew about ones
   since the first season.

   [In] "Jaws Wired Shut," Homer cuts his head open and tries to tell Marge to
   drive to the hospital.  Despite the large visible wound Marge can not
   understand him.  She just tells Homer to sit down and relax.  He runs miles
   to the hospital and tells the nurse that he has cut his head open.  The
   nurse does not understand him.  He has to sign and large questionnaire and
   wait hours to get help.  While he is waiting there is sign with a man
   holding his own severed head that says "Don't hold your Breath and try not
   to >bleed to death."


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Joe Green alterna-title for this show is:  I Have No Mouth, and Yet I Must
   (ANNOYED GRUNT)


Don Del Grande:  During WWII, the British really did call Sauerkraut "liberty
   cabbage" (they also called German Shepherd dogs "alsatians", something they
   still do today).  "Three wars ago" would be WWII if you count Korea and
   Vietnam but not, say, Desert Storm.  {ddg}


Joe Klemm:  Dilbert is a comic strip by Scott Adams about daily office life.


Benjamin Robinson:  Didn't Don Del Grande once suggest a "quiet please" pre-
   movie cartoon featuring "The Simpsons?"  Well, that's a rhetorical question
   -- I know for a fact that he did.  Anyway, that's what the I&S short
   brought to mind.

==============================================================================
% Homer relaxes on the backyard hammock, reading the latest issue of
% "Pie Times."  A commotion out front gets his attention, and he joins
% the rest of the Simpsons on the front curb.  The noise is coming
% from a parade -- the Springfield Gay Pride parade.

Marchers:	We're here!  We're queer!  Get used to it!
Lisa:		You do this every year!  We are used to it.
Marcher:	Spoilsport!
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% This year's parade offers a few things the family may not have seen. 
% There's a float promoting safe-sex, where two men in full-body
% radiation suits safely express their love by shaking hands.  Another
% float, celebrating gays who are still closeted, features two people
% chanting from behind closet doors that are slightly ajar.

Patty[*] +
 Smithers:	We're gay!
Smithers:	            We're glad!
Patty:	                         But don't tell Mom and Dad!
Marge:		Wouldn't it be great if that man and woman got 
		together?
-- But somewhat self-defeating, "Jaws Wired Shut"

[*] By popular speculation; we never do see who's behind the doors.

% Next up is the Lesbians of the Caribbean float, which has a sound
% system playing, "Yo, ho, ho!  It's an alternative lifestyle for me!"
% to the tune of Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean."  The float is
% shaped like a standard pirate desert island, where butch-looking
% lesbians chase their feminine-looking counterparts.
%
% The next float is a salute to brunch.  Lisa encourages Maggie to
% wave at it.
%
% The brunch float is followed by a salute to tight abdomens.  Some
% body-builders show off their "six packs," while Homer moans that
% he's got a keg.  He lifts his shirt to show his beer gut, and a
% horrified gay man puts a screen in front of him.
%
% After the floats, a group of gay dogs marches past the family.  SLH
% is oddly intrigued by them, which freaks Homer out.  He decides the
% family has seen enough, and they leave, dragging SLH behind them.
%
% The family ends up at the Springfield Googolplex, where Homer buys
% four tickets for "Shenani-Goats," even though it's rated PG-13 for
% brief rudeness and appearances by Gary Shandling.
%
% The Simpsons settle into their seats in the theater.  To pass the
% time before the film begins, some movie-related puzzles are flashed
% on the screen.

	[we see a silhouette and the words "MOT HANKS"]
Lisa:	These are so easy.  It's obviously Tom Hanks.
	[the answer appears on the screen:  "OTM SHANK"]
	[confused] Who?
Apu:	Otm Shank.  He is India's answer to Brian Dennehy.  
[slowly] Otm ... Shank.
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% And now, a public service announcement from Itchy and Scratchy.  The
% cat and mouse team is in a theater packed full of other cartoon
% animals.  A duck's cell phone rings, and he annoys the other patrons
% by carrying on a loud conversation.  Itchy resolves the breach of
% etiquette by replacing the ducks cell phone with a stick of
% dynamite.  It explodes, leaving only the duck's skeleton.  As the
% rest of the audience laughs, Itchy slices open Scratchy's gut, and
% uses the cat's entrails to write "Please no talking" on the movie
% screen.  Bart and Lisa laugh, but Homer gets anxious to see the
% movie.
%
% The movie's up next!  But first, some previews for coming
% attractions.

Announcer:	Justin's soccer team was in last place ...

		[cut to the mummy, shown from the torso up.  We hear

		impatience.  Show the movie!
-- The mirthless laugh of the damned, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% But the previews just grind on and on.

Homer:		[muttering under his breath] So many previews, so

% Homer jumps up in front of the screen and chants, "Start the movie! 
% Start the movie!"  The rest of the audience quickly joins in, to the
% concern of the ushers.

Usher 1:	They're out of control!
Usher 2:	Well, if we wanted to live forever, we wouldn't have 
		become ushers.
-- The few, the proud ... "Jaws Wired Shut"

% The head usher takes out a giant "movie sized" Kit-Kat(TM) bar.  He
% and three other ushers break it into four pieces to make clubs. 
% Thusly armed, they head into the theater.

Homer:	[still chanting] Stop the madness!  Start the movie!
Lisa:	Maybe we should try to calm Dad down.
Bart:	I prefer to egg him on.  [to Homer] Hey Dad, has the movie 
	started yet?
Homer:	Arr-r-r-r-gh!
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Marge, on the other hand, decides to try calming down her husband.

Marge:		Homer, you're going to get into trouble.

		[they do]
Usher 1:	This ends here.
-- Any other bright ideas, Homer?  "Jaws Wired Shut"

% The ushers chase Homer out of the theater and pursue him to a park. 
% At the park, Mayor Quimby and boxer Drederick Tatum stand next to a 
% large statue of Tatum.  The two men have an audience seated in front
% of them.

Quimby:	And so, for helping to KO litter in our community, I 
	hereby dedicate this statue of Drederick Tatum.  [the 
	audience applauds]
Tatum:	Litter is my most treacherous foe.  I would like to eat 
	its children.
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Homer, fleeing from the ushers, turns his head to taunt them.  Bad
% move.  Not looking where he's going, Homer runs right into the
% statue's metal fist, which hits him squarely on the mouth.  He falls
% to the pavement.

Homer:	My mouth, my beautiful mouth!
Tatum:	Excellent bout.  Now, we go party.  [Quimby and Tatum

% Dr. Hibbert examines an X-ray of Homer's head.

Hibbert:	He won't be able to talk for quite some time.  I've 
		wired his jaw shut.  It's all explained in this 
		pamphlet.  [hands one to Marge]
Marge:		[reading] "So your life is ruined."  [grumbles, then 
		reads a bit]
		[to Homer] Oh, dear, you can't eat solid foods.
		[to Hibbert] Those are his favorites
Homer:		[semi-articulate, since he obviously can't open his 
		mouth] Agh cnnt ee suhluh foo!  [runs to a suicide 
		machine, which resembles a chair with some 
		hypodermic needles attached]
Marge:		Stop it, Homer!
Hibbert:	Oh, don't worry.  On a man his size, that just 
		provides sexual release.

		looks satisfied]
-- Hibbert's sex machine, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Back home, Homer finds eating a steak to be a challenge.  He can't
% open his mouth to eat it, so he cuts off a small piece and tries

% afterward.
%
% Bart walks up.

Bart:		Hey, Dad, I'm going to make a human yo-yo.  If you

Duffman:	Hey, Duff lovers!  Does anyone in this bar love 
		Duff?
Carl:		Hey, it's Duffman!

Duffman:	Duffman can never die; only the actors who play him.

		grains?
Lenny:		How about ancient hop-grain juice?
Homer:		Beehr!  Beehr!  [points to a bottle of Duff] Beehr!
Moe:		Wait a minute, wait, Homer's trying to make a guess.
Homer: 		Beehr!  Beehr!  Beehr!  [he reaches over and opens

% It's a little too late for the free beer, but eventually someone
% gives Homer a little chalkboard that he can use to communicate.  In

	day?" on his chalkboard]
Marge:	[reading] "How was your day?"  Do you really want to know?
Homer:	[nods] Uhn-huh.
Marge:	Well, let's see.  I was in the kitchen counting the 
	corncobs on the curtains, when who should ring the

% The next day, Homer feeds Maggie.  She's so cute, Homer tries to
% give her a kiss, but Maggie's pacifier gets stuck in Homer's jaw
% wires.  Worse yet, Maggie cannot be coaxed into letting go of her
% end of the pacifier.  Even when Homer spins around, Maggie hangs on

% Homer's story attracts the attention of Lindsey Naegle, who for the

		where it counts?  I'm talking down-town!

Barbara:	Marge, what was Homer like before he bwoke his jaw?
Marge:		Well, he was eating all the time.  We'd be making 
		love and he'd have a mouthful of Hershey's 
		miniatures.

% "Well," Barbara continues, "Marge told us when you didn't listen, it

Homer:		[from the next room] I'm going to kill you!
Marge:		Well, so much for the new Homer.
		[Marge walks into the living room.  Homer and Bart 
		are there, holding copies of a script]
		What's going on?
Bart:		We're rehearsing a play.
Homer:		Yes, and I was merely reading the title.  [shows 
		Marge the title page] "I'm Going to Kill You."
Marge:		Oh.  It's just a false alarm.
Homer:		Yep.  Nothing to get excited about.
Marge:		Well, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.
Homer:		[looks at the script] Professor Van Doren -- so good 
		to see you.
		[camera angle switches to reveal that a 
		distinguished-looking gentleman has entered the 
		room]
Van Doren:	Ah, rehearsing a play, I see.

% Homer continues to stick to his pledge of good behavior.  He even
% drinks milk and goes to bed at 7:30.  The quietude has an unexpected
% effect on Marge, who is starting to go bonkers from boredom.  That
% night, as Homer sleeps, Marge lies awake in bed, staring at the
% ceiling.

Marge:	[thinking] This place is so *boring*.  If somebody doesn't 
	do something interesting, I'm going to have to.  But what?
	[a gust of wind blows the demolition derby entry form off 
	the dresser and into Marge's hand]
	[thinking] The demolition derby?  That'll scratch my itch.
	[gets out of bed and leaves.  Homer wakes up as soon as 
	she's gone]
Homer:	Marge?  [looks at Marge's side of the bed] Marge is gone!  
	But at least the demolition derby form is ... [looks at 
	the dresser and sees the form is missing, too] What?
	No-o-o!
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Marge shows up at the derby in the family wagon.  She puts on a
% racing helmet, and is ready for battle.  The derby announcer bids
% the contestants to start their engines, and the vendors to start
% gouging.
%
% "And now," the announcer says, "Smashy, smashy!"  With that, the
% derby is under way.  Otto, who has entered the school bus, honks his
% horn and gives Marge a friendly greeting.  One of the other
% contestants smashes into the bus, turning it on its side.  Otto
% flips it back upright by opening those fold-out stop signs used when
% loading or unloading children.
%
% Marge smacks into one of the other derby cars.

Marge:	Catch ya later, radiator!
	[thinking] My God, I hit someone, then I taunted him.  
	I've never felt more alive!  [giggles]
	[an SUV hits Marge, sending the station wagon spinning]
	What was I thinking trying to feel alive?  Forget that!
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% The black SUV aims at Marge's wagon and guns it.

Don't hurt me!  I'm not like you people; I'm loved!
-- Marge Simpson, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% The SUV slams into Marge's car, sending her crash helmet flying into
% the stands.  Cletus catches it.

I caught a head!  [examines the empty helmet] Aw, dang!  It's been 
scooped out.  [tosses it aside]
-- Cletus Spuckler, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Homer, Bart, and Lisa arrive at the derby, and immediately see that
% Marge is in deep trouble.  But without his characteristic bold
% moves, Homer has no idea how to save her.  Bart spots a beer vendor,
% and calls for a can.  The vendor has no problem with tossing a cold
% brewski to a ten-year-old boy.  Bart opens it Popeye-style,
% squeezing it until the beer pops out, and Homer swallows it all as
% it comes back to earth.  "Oh, this beer's deliskous," Homer says
% with a Popeye accent, "I'm going to saves me wife.  Now let's get
% this show on the road.  "
%
% The black SUV repeatedly rams Marge's car.  Homer comes to the
% rescue.

Homer:		Quit banging my wife!
		[Homer rides into the arena on the trouble-making 
		donkey]
Derby Ann. 1:	A man on a donkey!  Never in my six weeks on the job 
		have I seen the likes of this!
		[the donkey stops, exhausted]
Homer:		[Popeye-like] Eh, looks like I need some fuel for me 
		mule; gas for me ass.  [chuckles]
		[gives the donkey a beer; the animal perks up for a 
		second and then passes out]
		Aw, looks like a little angel.
-- He's Homer the beer-drinking man, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Donkey or no donkey, Homer is determined to save his wife.  He runs
% over to the station wagon and pulls Marge to safety just before the
% SUV delivers another blow.
%
% Bart and Lisa watch from the stands.

Bart:	Oh, isn't it great to have the old Dad back?
Lisa:	I thought you liked the new Dad.
Bart:	Whatever.
-- He's flexible, "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Marge thanks Homer for the rescue.

Marge:	[kisses Homer] This family needs a live wire, but it's 
	just not me.
Homer:	That's okay, Marge, you're a good wet blanket -- the kind 
	I like wrapped around me.
-- "Jaws Wired Shut"

% Homer and Marge leave the derby grounds, as the black SUV's driver
% smashes into the remaining vehicles.  The announcer sums up the
% evening for those who missed the first twenty-seven minutes of the
% show.

Derby Ann. 1:	When Homer's jaw was crushed, crushed, crushed, his 
		life took a nitro-burning funny-turn.
Derby Ann. 2:	Oh yeah!  It's important to grow, grow, grow, but if 
		you take it to the max, max, max, it's going to get 
		ugly.
Derby Ann. 1:	In the mud.
-- Derby Announcer, "Jaws Wired Shut"
