==============================================================================
   At the chili cook-off, Chief Wiggum's imported chili peppers send
   Homer on a hallucinatory spiritual journey that makes him question
   whether Marge is his soulmate.

==============================================================================
> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Couch      :- Everybody descends via parachute to the couch, except
              Homer, who lands on the floor with an unopened chute on
              his back.  [Recycled from 3F23]

==============================================================================
> Did you notice...
==============================================================================
   ... a bum at the cookoff is selling water for $3?
   ... Dr. Nick is dancing with Princess Kashmir?
   ... when Homer tastes the first pepper after coating his mouth with
       wax, a mother covers her daughter's eyes (in much the same way
       Marge covers Maggie's eyes in similar situations)?
   ... Homer calls a personal ad placed by a gay black male (GBM)?

Dale G. Abersold:
   ... Lenny doesn't say anything to Marge or Homer when they are at his
       booth?
   ... Marge has a kerosene lantern?
   ... Marge is able to climb a ladder in her dress, while carrying a
       giant lightbulb?  (I'm impressed!)

Stephan Bonneville:
   ... Homer's fantasyland is similar to Lisa's drunken nightmare in
       9F11?
   ... Captain McAllister has been replaced by EARL as the the
       lighthouse keeper?
   ... Mr. Burns is unusually strong in this episode?
   ... Homer's hairs standing on end when he wakes up?
   ... Rod and Todd now appear to be the same height?
   ... Homer identifies it as a tortoise as opposed to a turtle?

Vince Chan:
   ... Ruth Powers is in the crowd the second time Homer tries Chief
       Wiggums chili?
   ... the telephone booth is on an island in the middle of the road?
   ... the kids are brushing their teeth long after Marge is asleep?
   ... Marge does not have the lantern on until she opens the door?
   ... most of the town is on the beach in the middle of the night?

Joshua Fruhlinger:
   ... this is the first time in a long time we've seen Smithers without
       an over-the-top gay reference *and* Ralph saying something that
       vaguely makes sense?
   ... Homer is pretty open about what gender his "soul mate" might be? 
       (Never mind "GBM;" his first choice as soul mate is Barney!)
   ... when Homer is trying to explain to Marge what has happened to
       him out by the clothesline, with her back to him, the scene
       looks just like Homer trying to talk to the faceless Marge he
       saw during his "trip?"

Don Del Grande:
   ... at the beginning of Act II, there is a "live-action" shot of
       clouds behind Homer?  (This is the first live-action footage used
       with "2-D" characters, isn't it?)
   ... Reverend Lovejoy's first name is used?  (Helen calls him "Tim" at
       the end of the cook-off)
   ... Kearney is somewhere (Moe's) without Jimbo and Dolph?
   ... Charlie's voice is different than it usually is?
   ... Dr. Hibbert now knows Moe's is a bar?
   ... Homer says "they're starting to turn" long after the ship starts
       its turn?
   ... for someone with a hat over her eyes, Maggie certainly does a
       good job of walking straight?  (Lisa was holding her hand, but if
       Maggie would have been walking "out of line", their arms would
       have straightened as Lisa "pulls her back".)

Jonathan Haas:
   ... Marge doesn't stop Bart from stealing from the Lost and Found?
   ... Mr. Burns quite definitely went to Yale?
   ... "Virtual Chili" involves a head-mounted display, a 6DOF joystick,
       and something over your mouth?
   ... Chief Wiggum's chili tent is decorated with skulls and other
       occult items?
   ... Otto says that Homer "knows what he's doing"? Otto might be the
       one character who best understood what Homer was going through.
   ... Rev. Lovejoy actually stops Helen from continuing to torment
       Marge?
   ... Homer and Marge still use vinyl records?
   ... Homer thinks the sun revolves around the earth?
   ... Marge carries an old-fashioned kerosene lantern?

Jason Hancock:
   ... the "HOMER" bowling ball is in the closet?
   ... the two porta-potties to the left of the Bumblebee Man's chili
       stand?
   ... Lenny is offering handwoven dishtowels?
   ... Otto knows who Ralph is?
   ... Homer is seen wearing his regular shoes, and not his chili boots,
       during the dream?
   ... the clock on Bart's "Time for Chili" hat reads 4:00?
   ... Homer's pupils shrink after he opens his eyes?
   ... the "Discabinetron 2000" label on OFF's record shelf?
   ... the Bumblebee Man wears his costume inside Moe's?
   ... Homer leaves his newspaper in the phone booth as he exits it?

Eric Hartman:
   ... the turtle looks like people from "The Critic"?
   ... the girl who has the ice cream cone looks like Allison Taylor?
         [I thought she looked like the "teef" girl in 3F02 --ed]

Joe Klemm:
   ... Maggie's hat covers her eyes (ala The Homer They Fall couch gag)?

Haynes Lee:
   ... it took Fox three calendar years (1995-97) to show the entire 3F
       series?
   ... Springfield Shopper uses color in its advertising?

Dallas Pesola
   ... Bumblebee Man in the first chili tent?
   ... Moe has a chili *bar*, not simply a chili stand or tent?
   ... Marge has records that are worse than the one by the "Doodletown
       Pipers"?
   ... the Sylvania 40,000 watt Energy Miser Lighthouse Bulb?

Benjamin J. Robinson:
   ... the cadence of Nelson's laugh is reversed?  (That is, the accent
       is now on the second "Ha.")

Liam J. Scanlan:
   ... this episode has no official title? (SNPP sources say it as "El
       Viaje Misteriosos de Nuestro Homer", but FOX says it's "The
       Mysterious Voyage of Homer". I have two sources to back up the
       second title.)

Robert Vasquez:
   ... Smithers is at the square dance, rather than in Burns' booth?
   ... Ralph now knows that eating wax is wrong?
   ... after Bart says his hat is "wasted on an idiot like [Lisa]," he
       immediately looks for Homer?
   ... when Homer sees Marge after his hallucination, her back is turned
       to him just like on the ziggurat?
   ... Quimby's running for office again?

Matt Scott Zelman:
   ... Homer calls the coyote "wolfie"?
   ... Dr. Hibbert drinks alcohol?
   ... Bart and Lisa recognize the bat signal?

==============================================================================
> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
==============================================================================
*  How did Marge get that vacuum cleaner plugged in so fast?  {ol}

*  Unless the plunger of the phone is broken, I don't think pushing a
   vacuum cleaner against it would make it come out.  {ol}

+  Marge was worried about Bart smoking in Treehouse of Horror IV.  Now
   suddenly she considers having a smoke just for the sake of smoking?
   (Looks like she can just kiss that "Mother of the Year" award
   goodbye)  {ol}

+  Why does Homer object to the cigarettes? In 3F08 he actually bought
   some for Marge.  {sb}

+  Didn't Marge smoke during the ending of 1F03?  {mss}

*  I doubt Homer could whistle so easily after having his head flooded
   in smoke.  (Notice how he's about to cough just before.)

*  Why should Marge care if Homer gets drunk at that cook-off?  She
   didn't seem to want to go herself.  If anything, Homer would just be
   embarrassing himself, and he does that good enough on many occasions.
   {ol}

+  In 3F21 Homer was told not to eat spicy foods by the vet.  {vc}

+  Marge should know what oregano is.  She uses various herbs and spices
   on her pork chops in 7F09.  {ol}

*  In the bird's-eye shot of Homer staring down Wiggum at the cook-off,
   only Homer casts a long shadow.  {tl}

*  The peppers were sitting in boiling hot water; they should have
   burned Homer`s fingers.  {sb}

*  Since when are whole peppers put in chili?  {ol}

=  Marge magically has a watch on her right wrist for one scene.  {msz}

*  Drinking hot liquid wax should send Homer screaming in pain for a
   while.

=  When Homer's stomach starts affecting him, Jasper is in a booth, but
   he's also in the crowd in front of whom Homer falls down.  {ddg}

=  The "OIS" in "FOLLOW THE TORTOISE" is spelled on the ground on the
   side view, yet on the arial view, we have to wait for the tortoise to
   finish spelling it.  {ljs}

*  The pyramid would have to slide to the left while it grew or else it
   would pick up Homer.  {ljs}

*  I always thought that Homer had three hairs on his head, two on top
   and one going around the back and sides. However, when he was talking
   with the coyote and the wind blows through his hair, I counted four
   distinct hairs. The long strand going around his head was made of two
   hairs. Was my initial assumption of three hairs wrong?  {ns}

+  Marge doesn't need to dry her clothes on a line since she got a
   perfectly good dryer from Herb in 8F23.  {vc}

+  Moe's was surprisingly crowded and un-dank in this episode.  {mss}

+  In 1F03, Moe said he was phasing out the games because people drink
   less when they're having fun. Now he has a pool table.  {sb}

*  How could a shadow appear as a circle in the sky if there is no solid
   background to it?  {ljs}

*  Homer's shadow shouldn't be visible in the sky if the light points
   toward the ground - but the light keeps switching between pointing to
   the ground and pointing to the sky.  {ddg}

=  When Bart and Lisa are looking at Homer's shadow, the light stops
   blinking.  {ddg}

*  After Bart and Lisa look at Homer's shadow, the light appears to
   shine over Homer, so his shadow shouldn't be visible.  {ddg}

*  How did Marge remove the remnants of the old bulb without
   electrocuting herself?  {ddg}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Odd, to say the least.  I loved the surrealistic
   animation in Act II, and there were plenty of funny moments (the
   highlight was probably Homer calling "GBM.")  On the down side, one
   never had an idea what the writer wanted, and the ending was
   (unfortunately) predictable.  Johnny Cash was very good as the Coyote
   spirit guide.  (B-)

Jennifer M. Blaske:  Marge's character seemed a bit "off," but I liked
   Homer's Trip. My main problem was the ending. Saying, "Oh, it is
   Marge after all" seemed to be cheating. Personally, I would have
   liked it if Homer's soul mate were God; after all, no person fully
   understands us, but God presumably does. I was hoping for a
   Thought-Provoking Episode, a la the Blowfish one, but this ending
   fell flat.  (C+)

Chris Courtois:  Ken Keeler redeems himself with "El Viaje
   Misterioso..." While the ending was rushed and forced (both forced
   emotions and forced wacky gags), the first 2 1/2 acts (everything
   from the chili cookoff scene through Homer's phone conversation with
   GBM) was among the best OFF of the past 2 seasons. The chili cookoff
   and dream sequences were outstanding. Another kudo for Keeler for
   using references in a manner which didn't bring the entire episode to
   a halt.
      After such an inspired middle portion, it was a little
   disappointing to see the episode turn into yet another Homer-Marge
   strained relationship episode, especially coming so soon after "A
   Milhouse Divided". The ending in the lighthouse veered off into wacky
   gag with a quick resolution area, but considered what came before,
   that's a minor quibble.  (A-)

Joshua Fruhlinger:  Boy!  Was THAT weird!  Interesting, though, and
   highly enjoyable.  The middle section (Homer's "trip") wasn't side
   splitting funny, but beautifully animated and fascinating to watch.
   (Though I did get a big kick out of "Note to self: don't do
   anything.")  For the rest of the episode, the gags were enough to
   carry it.  I almost fell out of the chair during the "GBM" sequence.
   And Homer's whiny dance was very well done.  (A-)

Jason Hancock:  This is one of the weirdest episodes I have ever seen.
   Homer's hallucinations reminded me of Lisa's trip to Duff Gardens (in
   "Selma's Choice") with some good special effects.  There were several
   funny moments, like Homer's phone call; however, I was not impressed
   with Marge's behavior in this episode.  (B-)

Ryan Johnson:  The chili tasting and Homer's trip were wounderful,
   although they did seem to be in a different style (altogether, not
   just the animation) than we've seen before.  The ending was a bit
   lame, but it didn't crush the first to acts in its stupidity as the
   past few episodes have.  It's unfortunate that this was run within a
   few weeks of "A Millhouse Divided".  (B)

Ondre Lombard:  Bad animation, mostly flat jokes and a story that lacks
   depth makes this an all time clanger, to me.  Homer's quest for his
   new soulmate is handled rather improperly.  I, myself, am tired of
   seeing stories about Homer and Marge's relationship in jeopardy.  It
   was a bold idea at one point, but it isn't anymore.  The ending is so
   predictable and forced that it just totally falls flat.  I didn't too
   much care for the animation or most of Homer's hallucenation either.
   A few good jokes, but a story that leaves much to be desired.  (D+)

Nate Patrin:  Oh wow.... hea-veee. Some of the most innovative animation
   I've ever seen in a Simpsons ep- or anywhere. Homer's trip was
   practically art. But outside of the animation, there was also a slew
   of hilarious jokes, unusual moments and a not-entirely-formulaic
   episode. Johnny Cash was the best voice-over by a musician since the
   Ramones in [1F01], and though this was yet another retread of the
   Marge-and-Homer-have-friction theme, it was handled in an interesting
   way. The best ep this season.  (A)

Werner Peeters:  The animation of Homer's hallucinations was superb. Too
   bad this episode didn't have a story! Though the beginning was quite
   nice (esp. Maggie with a cowboy hat), the plot - of any - went very
   mellow... Homer looking for a soul mate, and surprise surprise, it's
   Marge! I'm a bit disappointed in this one, because in former
   episodes, people hallucinating was always good for some very funny
   scenes (remember Otto with the talking shoes? Lisa the Lizard Queen
   etc.).  (C-)

Benjamin J. Robinson:  For an episode that gets by on its looks, it does
   pretty well.  Ken Keeler has written some of the show's more oddball
   episodes, and he really gets a chance to strut his stuff here.
   Homer's psychedelic sojourn in the desert is the high point of this
   episode, with hog-wild animation that is a treat to watch.  The setup
   and wind-down lack the same spark, though.  Check out Johnny Cash (!)
   in a cameo as Homer's spirit guide.  (B)

Matt Rose:  This was a bizarre and often surreal episode, and most of
   the time these things bother me but I didn't care this time, because
   I was on the floor after some of the hallucinations. Interesting
   cameo by Johnny Cash. I would have liked it better if Homer had tried
   "Professor Frink's Virtual Chili"....anyhoo, the ending seemed a
   little rushed and somewhat mushy but overall a pretty good episode.
   And Bart and Lisa were pretty much nowhere to be found. Still, it was
   pretty funny, and that is why I watch the show.  (B+)

Liam J. Scanlan:  The hallucination sequence was superb and enjoyed by
   me. However because it went by too fast for me, I didn't really enjoy
   the last act. Johnny Cash had a boring a small role. But it was still
   enough for my to watch it over and over again.  (A-)

Nelson Seggley:  I loved this episode. It followed Homer's strange
   perception of reality to its logical conclusion. The spiritual coyote
   with the voice of Johnny Cash was great. Marge's attempt to prevent
   Homer from finding out about the Chili cookoff was great. The
   Reverend's wife was deliciously evil. All the pop-culture references
   in this episode makes me think that the writers kinda gave the real
   Simpsons fanatics something they could sink their teeth into- the
   last few episodes were kind of introductory.  (A)

Robert Vasquez:  Well! Now we know why it took so long for this episode
   to appear. I imagine Gracie Films treated this episode as an
   extra-special event, like Chuck Jones and "What's Opera, Doc?" The
   backgrounds in the hallucination were breathtaking, and Johnny Cash
   was better than perfect as the coyote spirit-guide. I only wish I'd
   taken a look at my dad's Carlos Castaneda books so I'd have some more
   insight into the parody.  (A)

Mike Yeomans:  The writers really came up short on this one. The only
   real laugh-out-loud joke was with the turtle. A slow moving story
   that doesn't even show the simpson kids. It's probably the least
   funny episode since "'Round Springfield" and the worst storyline
   since... well, ever.  (D)

Matt Scott Zelman:  Nothing uproariously funny but overall very good.
   Unfortunately the ideas of "homer embarresing marge" and "homer
   questioning his marriage to marge" had a kind of been there-done that
   feel to them.  And like most episodes this season-no definitive
   subplot!  Homer's hallucination scene was classic though, especially
   johnny cash as the coyote.  (B+)

Yours Truly:  And I thought 3F18 was out of the ordinary... Funny how
   this episode tried to concile opposing trends: both usual and unusual
   types of animation, quick jokes and deep mysticism, an innovative
   mystical journey and the old "Homer's marriage in crisis" plot.
   Trying different avenues, this episode felt like a bumper car
   bouncing off walls, reaching new places with a few bruises in the
   process. Therefore, it called for a mitigated feeling; one I would
   not care to experience every week, but which was enjoyable while it
   lasted.  (B)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Writer Watch
 
Dale G. Abersold:  Ken Keeler has had a shaky career as a writer for The
   Simpsons.  His first episode was "A Star is Burns" [2F31], the
   "Critic" crossover disowned by Matt Groening.  His next episode was
   "Two Bad Neighbors" [3F09] hated by many (including former President
   Bush).  Perhaps it is because of their departure from established
   continuity which makes these episodes so distasteful to some viewers
   (as they do not lack of good jokes).  This season, he wrote "The
   Thing and I" from the Hallowe'en episode [4F02].  His next
   assignments are the eagerly-awaited Sideshow Bob episode "The Brother
   from Another Series" [4F14], and next season's "The Principal and the
   Pauper" [4F23].


>> Hey, that title ain't English!

Dale G. Abersold:  This is the second Simpsons episode with a title in a
   foreign language (the first being, of course, "Burns Verkaufen der
   Kraftwerk" [8F09]).

      [at least *this* title makes sense in Spanish, unlike 8F09 --ed]


>> Saltpeter, as was the style at the time

Jonathan S. Haas:  Saltpeter, or potassium nitrate (KNO3), is a
   versatile compound used as a preservative, and also in the
   manufacture of explosives. Saltpeter is 75% of common gunpowder.
   Consumed in large quantities, it's rumored to cause impotence.

   However, Mr. Burns's "Saltpeter Chili" is probably a reference to
   "Chile Saltpeter", which is sodium nitrate or NaNO3.


>> Dave Hall's Insanity Sauce  (or something similar...)

Dallas Pesola:  Guatemalan Insanity Pepper might be a reference to
   Dave's Insanity Sauce.  This hot sauce is well known as the hottest
   sauce that can be directly consumed.  The substance in peppers that
   make them hot is called capsaicin.  This extract is added to sauces
   to make them unbearably hot.  The capsaicin extract is sold as a
   product called Pure Cap.  Hot sauce companies will not sell it to you
   unless you sign a waiver first.  It is that dangerous.


>> From eating red crayons to speaking against candle-drinking

Brett Barabash:  My theory is, that the writers have found an even
   greater sense of pleasure portraying Homer as being unintelligent. So
   dimwitted, in this case, that Ralph Wiggum has more common sense than
   he does when he goes to drink a candle.

   Also, Ralph probably learned that a hot candle does not make a good
   beverage from personal experience...


>> Fussin' over peyote

   [Many people have argued that Homer's hallucination was the result of
   peyote, a drug used in Native American ceremonies. I leave to
   Jonathan Haas the care of replying to this. --ed]

Jonathan Haas:  Peyote is a cactus and is quite visually distinct from
   capsicum peppers. Besides, Wiggum *says* quite clearly that the
   ingredient in his chili is a special pepper from Guatemala.

   People have gone on trips in the Simpsons before under the influence
   of non-drugs. Warm cream and dried gravy aren't exactly psychoactive
   in real life, but they were on the show.


>> Space coyote?

Tom Pierce:  A few people had asked about the relevance of the coyote in
   the Guatamalean Insanity Pepper episode. Homer, standing on top of a
   very Aztec-y looking pyramid, is visited by a coyote (with Johnny
   Cash's voice, no less) who gives him rather insufficient spiritual
   advice about finding his true Soulmate. He also makes a go at eating
   Homer's pants.

   A couple people said it was a reference to Carlos Castaneda, probably
   "Teachings of Don Juan". Well, that's kind of an empty answer; it was
   a direct reference to Old Man Coyote, even though it incorporated a
   lot of the ideas Castaneda put forward about "the spiritual search",
   ideas that were already ages old.

   Many tribes believed in the concept of spirit helpers, entities who
   would serve as a guide through the metaphysical aspects of life.
   Young tribe members would be send out on a "vision quest", where they
   would fast and meditate (or take hallucinogens, or hit themselves on
   the head with a rock, or whatever made it work for them). While in
   this state (the Shamanic State of Conciousness, if you want to be
   technical about it), they would see an animal (or bird or fish) that
   would have chosen to represent them, and in many ways, become their
   spiritual Guardian Angel.

   In quite a few tribes, it was a combination of an honor and a
   horrible disaster for your spirit animal to be Coyote.

   Old Man Coyote (First Person, Trickster) ranged from being the most
   powerful of the Native American spirits to the most useless,
   sometimes within the course of one story about him. Foolish, vain,
   obtuse, and horribly ravenous. Much like Homer. Also like Homer,
   Coyote was also fond of talking to his brain (and any other body
   parts who wanted to chip in).

   His "advice" was almost always of no true benefit, aside from the
   fact that the attempt to follow his advice would teach the follower
   important lessons about themselves and the goal they seek. Much like
   Homer is mislead by Coyote into doubting Marge as his soulmate; his
   rather moronic search for his true soulmate eventually shows him the
   truth of the matter. He gets nothing out of Coyote's advice except a
   reassurance that what he has is what he was looking for.

   Sometimes, however, Coyote's advice was just malicious, done for his
   own amusement. To me, at least, it seemed uproarously funny for
   Coyote to have chosen to speak to Homer; both are clowns who make
   decisions based on whims that haven't been thought out at all.

   Notice how Coyote is happy when Homer threatens to "mop the floor"
   with him. Most godly creatures wouldn't respond well to a mortal
   saying that; Coyote would think it showed spirit. And ignorance. Both
   wonderful things.

   Maybe one of the Simpsons writers read some Carlos Castaneda and
   based it solely on that. But I doubt it - they're pretty slick, and
   if even half of the minor references I caught were intended, they did
   an excellent job.

      [seems we got a new winner in the "what did the show teach you"
      thread --ed]


>> Flowers By Irene

   The different agencies listening to Homer's line are:

   NSA - National Security Agency
      Responsible for the US government computer and communication
      security, this agency is mostly into encryption. It is known for
      its DES encryption scheme, and the infamous Clipper chip.

   FBI - Federal Bureau of Investigation
      The police force of the US Department of Justice, it provides help
      to other law enforcement agencies, investigates the more serious
      federal crimes, and defends the country against foreign
      intelligence attacks.

   ATF - Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
      Affiliated with the US Department of Treasury, the ATF collects
      revenue and enforces the law regarding alcohol, tobacco and
      firearms.

   CIA - Central Intelligence Agency
      An external agency, distinct from the US government, responsible
      of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities.

   KGB - Komitet Gosudarstvennoi Bezopaznosti
      USSR's own intelligence agency, long considered as the opposite
      player against the FBI and CIA. Due to the fall of USSR, the KGB
      has been disbanded.  [or am I wrong about this?]

   MCI - Microwave Communications Incorporated
      One of the two big US phone companies, the other being AT&T. Both
      are fighting a merciless war over local/long-distance/collect
      fees. You might remember an MCI 1-800-COLLECT ad featuring Homer
      two years ago, at the start of 2F20.


>> Look!  Up in the sky!  It's ... oh, wait, that's someone else

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  When Homer stands in front of the lighthouse
   beam, Lisa notes that either her father is casting the shadow, or
   Batman has let himself go lately.  No doubt she's thinking of the
   world-famous Bat Signal (tm). In the days before wireless pagers, the
   commissioner of Gotham City needed a way to alert Batman that the
   city needed his services.  The solution was a searchlight with a bat
   logo (not Batman himself) painted on the lens.  When criminal
   masterminds struck, the commish would shine the light in the sky,
   projecting the logo on a cloud.  Batman would come to the rescue.
   Good thing Gotham's supervillains never thought to attack on a clear,
   cloudless night.


>> So, you thought bell-bottoms looked tacky

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  Hot pants were a notorious fashion accessory in
   1970s America. Basically, they were womens' pants so short that they
   didn't quite cover the entire derriere.  Today, they're in the same
   joke-fashion class as leisure suits.  Considering the way women try
   to hide their rear ends, it's a wonder they caught on in the first
   place.


>> Character Analysis

Matt Scott Zelman:  Homer: The way he fidgeted when he realized they
   were "missin' the cook off" was hilarious.  It showed once again how
   much Homer is a kid at heart.  The hallucination and search for a
   soulmate also showed us a new open minded side of Homer we may not
   have seen before.

   Marge: She smokes, she swears, she's not there to support Homer's
   chili eating, she gets excited by neon and rhinestone.  Maybe Marge
   is going through a whole new stage (with a cigarette addiction).


>> The Immortal Threads

   - Where is Springfield?

Dale G. Abersold:  West coast?  Apparently Springfield slopes towards
   the west, where the ocean and lighthouse are.

   - Is Smithers Gay?

Well, if there ever was a scene meant to unite a.t.s. under one side of
   the argument, this one certainly is the last to come to mind! Many
   argued that Smithers asked a *woman* to dance, while others
   mentionned that his outfit, in the words of Dave Grossman,
   "neutralizes any straight tendencies he might show for several
   episodes to come". Not to mention the "gay is/isn't normal" thread
   that followed.

   I leave the final words to Elson Trinidad's adaptation of a 4F01
   quote:

      "Smithers danced with a WOMAN! That is so gay!"


>> It goes like, gabba gabba hey, dee dee dee and so on...

Thomas C. Allard provides us with the lyrics to the Ramones' "Pinhead":

           Gabba Gabba
           We accept you
           We accept you
           One of us
           One of us

           I don't wanna be a pinhead NO MORE
           I just met a nurse that I could GO FOR

           D-U-M-B
           Everyone's accusing me

           Gabba gabba hey
           Gabba gabba yay

% It's breakfast time in the Simpson household.  While the children eat,

Oh, why do they have to put all of this crud in my newspaper.
[tosses sections aside]  "World."  "The Arts."  "Religion."
Ah-ha!  Here it is: "Kickin' Back."
-- Homer's vision of a newspaper, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Homer opens the paper, but there's a gaping hole in the first page.

Homer: Hey, who cut something out of my paper?
        [Homer stares suspiciously through the newspaper hole at his
        wife and children]
 Lisa: Not me.
 Bart: Not me.  I'm more of a mail-tamperer.
Marge: Don't look at me.  Just because I'm holding a pair of scissors.
        [Homer frowns]
       Scissors which I need to, uh, to... gussy up these curtains.
        [she half-heartedly trims the curtains, grinning sheepishly at
        her husband.]
-- "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Somewhat later, Homer is sitting on the couch with Marge, who's
% repairing her early damage to the curtains.  The phone rings.

Homer: Yello?  Oh, hi, Lenny.
        [Marge reacts with alarm]
       No, why would I need a ride this afternoon?
        [Marge begins to vacuum next to Homer.  He is forced to yell.]
       Where?  To the big annual what?
        [Marge pounds at the telephone plug with the vacuum.  Finally

Homer: What's wrong with you?  What are you trying to hide from me...
       [Homer opens the door and sniffs]  What's that smell?  Onions...
       chili powder... cumin... juicy ground chuck?  It's chili!  Oh, my

       missing the cook-off, it's going on right now, and I'm missing 
       it.
Marge: All right, I *was* trying to keep it from you, but I had a good
       reason.  Every time you go to that cook-off you get drunk as a
       poet on payday.
-- As drunk as James Dickey?  "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Marge asks him to remember last year.  In a flashback, we see an

% Back to the present.  Homer is shuffling around in the closet.

Homer: Well of course, everything looks bad if you remember it.  Now
       where are my chili boots?
       [finds them in the closet] Ah!
-- Somehow I'm not reassured, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

Marge: Okay, we'll go to the chili cook-off, but I want you to promise

Homer: Marge, we're missing the chili.  Less artsy, more fartsy.
Marge: Homer, I happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my

% Homer steps up to "Firehouse Ned's Five-Alarm Chili."

Homer: Five-alarm chili, eh?
  Ned: Uh-huh.
Homer: [eats some]  One, two... hey, what's the big idea?

% Bad, and The Ugly".

Wiggum: Afternoon, Homer.  Care for some chili?  I've added an extra

 Homer: Uh, Wiggy?  My chili's getting cold.
-- A fistful of chilis, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Everyone holds his breath as Homer nonchalantly picks a pepper from
% Wiggum's chili.  However, the pepper sears his tongue on the slightest
% contact.  Homer screams frantically, much to the crowd's amusement.
%
% He grabs an ice-cream cone from a little girl; wnfortunately, the ice
% cream melts before it actually touches his tongue.  He is finally
% about to down six mugs of beer simultaneously, when Marge sees him,
% and sternly reminds him of his promise.
%
% Later, Homer is reduced to slaking his thirst with water.  While
% complaining about his defeat, he absent-mindedly grabs a candle.

Ralph: Wait, mister, you're drinking a candle.  You don't want to get 
       wax in your mouth, do you?
Homer: [slyly] Maybe I do, son.  Maybe I do.
        [Homer chugs the candle, and spits out a stream of wax, which
        solidifies on the spot]
       Outstanding!
-- A man, a plan, a candle, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Homer reapproaches Wiggum's booth, his tongue now sealed in wax.

Wiggum: Hey, everybody, look who's back.  It's the biiig baby.  
	[childlike] Oh, dis porridge is too hot!  Oh, wah-wah-wah!  
         [crowd laughs, but Homer hands his spoon in silence]
        Want some more, do you?  Well, sure!  Heck, it's not my job to
        talk people out of killing themselves.
-- Bad cops, bad cops, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% To everyone's surprise, Homer quickly downs the pepper, and asks for
% more.  Wiggum fearfully hands him two more peppers, which follow the
% first one as rapidly.

 Quimby: Good lord, this can't be happening!
Hibbert: By all medical logic, steam should be shooting out of his ears.
 Krusty: His ears, if we're lucky.
-- Chili as seen on Road Runner, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Showing off, Homer gulps down a last one, and bows in front of his
% audience.

Well, Chief, don't quit your day job...  Whatever that is.
-- Homer, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% The crowd laughs and applauds, as Homer walks away in triumph.
% Savoring the moment, his regret is that Marge wasn't there to see it.
% However, his attention is quickly drawn to his stomach, which emits a
% loud rumble.  He walks around in pain, searching for help.

 Flanders: Well, sure, buddy, I'd be happy to help out. What can I 
	   [Ned's visage begins changing as Homer hallucinates] do-
	   diddily-doodily-diddly-hobbily-hibbily-gobbily-gobbily-

Krabappel: [muted trumpet sounds]
   Barney: [incredible belch]
-- And so it begins, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Homer screams and runs away, crashing through a wooden fence.

Ralph: Hey, Mister, do you need some help?
 Otto: Let him go, Ralph.  He knows what he's doing.

% In Paul McCartney's words, Homer "went into a dream."  Homer
% hyperventilates as his skin flows like some kind of liquid as he
% stands in front of a psychedelic cloudscape.

Okay, retrace your steps.  Woke up, fought with Marge, ate Guatemalan 
insanity peppers, then I...  Oh...
-- Homer's daily regimen, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"
       
% The rapidly morphing landscape plays hell with Homer's perspective.
% Thinking that he's in Shelbyville, he is divebombed by a giant,
% garishly colored butterfly.

Man, this is crazy.  I hope I didn't brain my damage.  
-- Who would notice?  "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Homer's facial features sink into his head and pop out the other side.
% He decides to check his pupils in a nearby stream.  His pupils are
% doing downright odd things.  Suddenly, the stream turns into a giant
% snake which coils around Homer and hisses at him.  He decides that
% he's going to be leaving.  As he walks towards the horizon, the sun
% moves up.  As he steps back, the sun goes down.  He likes this, and
% does it several times in a row until the sun hits the ground and
% shatters.  Homer screams.

Note to self: stop doing anything.
-- Good advice, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Meanwhile, in the real world, Marge stands by the exit of the
% cook-off, looking for her husband.

  Marge: Has anyone seen Homer?
  Helen: Marge, better you should hear it from me than from some gossipy
         neighbor.  Homer made a total jackass of himself.
Lovejoy: Helen, that's enough.  Call off your dogs.
  Helen: But someone had to tell her.  [sulking] And I got here first!
-- Gossip used for good, not evil?,
      "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Growls Marge "No beer, huh?  I guess I know what a promise from Homer
% J. Simpson is worth."

% Back in his chili trip, Homer is spelling out "HELP" with rocks.  One
% of the rocks crawls away, however.

Hey, buddy!  Get back there with the other rocks!
-- Homer's attempt to domesticate rocks,
      "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Homer is surprised to see that it is a (non-kinky) tortoise.  As the
% tortoise crawls, he leaves a message in the dirt.

Homer: [reading]  "Follow the..."
       [gasps]  This must be why I'm here!  Follow the what?  Follow the
       what?  Hurry up!
        [the message reads: "Follow the tortoise"]
       D'oh!  [that words forms in clouds of dust]
-- Yet, better than a snail, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Homer frantically follows the tortoise, which is moving far too slow
% to suit him.  "When I'm kicking you, that means hurry up!"  He then
% punts the reptile an incredible distance.  Homer follows it, taking
% increasingly greater strides, finally coming to a tiny Aztec-style
% pyramid.  The tortoise points to it.

Homer: Oh, you want me to climb that, huh?  No problemo.
        [before Homer can climb it, the ground rumbles and the pyramid
        grows to several times its original size]
       [groans]  This is 'cause I kicked you, isn't it?
        [the tortoise nods in assent]
-- Stupid poetic justice, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Back to the real world, the Simpsons are driving home.  Bart is
% wearing a "Time for Chili" hat.

Bart: Lis, check it out.  Time for chili.
Lisa: [bored] I saw it, Bart.
Bart: You're just mad 'cause there's no clock in your hat.
Lisa: What hat?
Bart: Pff.  Ah, this baby's wasted on an idiot like you.  
-- "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"
 
 Bart: Where's Homer?
Marge: [through clenched teeth] Your father decided he'd rather come
       home in a taxi.  [to herself] Or a police car.
-- "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% In his fantasy world, Homer, gasping, finishes climbing the pyramid.
% On top, he sees Marge with her back to him.  He tries to get her to
% look at him, running circles around her at one point, but he never
% sees her face.  "Fight fair, I never do this to you" he argues.
% Suddenly, a strong wind blows her away as she turns into a fine
% powder.
%
% Homer cannot stand this place anymore, wondering what he's doing there
% anyway.  "You are on a quest for knowledge" replies a disembodied
% voice.
%
% Homer looks up in the sky, where the moon turns into a giant eye.  A
% saturn-like planet floats down next to the eye and turns into another
% eye.  Then, the rest of a smiling canine face appears in the sky.  The
% face liquifies and then materializes as an entire coyote on the
% pyramid next to Homer.

Coyote: Fear not, Homer.  I am your spirit guide.
 Homer: [warily] Hiya.
Coyote: There is a lesson you must learn.
 Homer: If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of 
	you.
-- That's more than he usually learns,
      "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

Coyote: I speak of a deeper wisdom.  The problem, Homer, is that the 
        mind is always chattering away with a thousand thoughts at once.
 Homer: Yeah, that's me all right.  [Homer has a glazed look in his eyes
        as the wind blows his two hair strands.]
-- Yeah, right, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

Coyote: Clarity is the path to inner peace.
 Homer: Well, what should I do?  Should I meditate?  Should I get rid of
        all my possessions?
Coyote: [snorts]  Are you kidding?  If anything, you should get more
        possessions.  You don't even have a computer.
-- Inner peace through silicon circuitry,
      "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

 Homer: You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and I
        would...  [the coyote is chewing his pant leg]  Hey! Knock it
        off!  [kicks him]
Coyote: [sheepishly]  Sorry.  I _am_ a coyote.
-- "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

Look, just give me some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with you.
-- Homer bargains a cheap price to his inner peace,
      "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% The coyote instructs Homer to find his soulmate: the one with whom he
% shares a profound mystical understanding.  Homer thinks it is Marge,
% but the coyote, running off, makes him doubt himself.  Homer then sees
% a ghost train which runs over him...
%
% ...returning us to the real world, where Homer is hit on the head with
% a golf ball.  Kent Brockman calls security to get him off the course.

Homer: Huh?  Golf course?  Did I dream that whole thing?  Maybe the
       desert was just this sand trap.  Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid
       was just the pro shop.
        [the pro shop is on top of a giant pyramid, as well]
       And that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.
  Dog: Hi, Homer.  Find your soulmate.
Homer: Hey, wait a minute!  There's no such thing as a talking dog!
  Dog: [barks]
Homer: Damn straight!
-- Couldn't be more convincing myself,

Homer: Where's your mother?
 Lisa: Out back.
        [Homer walks out]
 Bart: So anyway, I says to Mabel, I says...

% In the backyard, Marge is putting the laundry out to dry with her back
% to him.  Her back stiffens when she hears her husband.

Homer: Oh-ho.  I guess you're cranky 'cause I didn't come home last
       night.
Marge: I'm "cranky" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in
       front of the entire town.  You broke your promise, Homer.
Homer: Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk, I just went to a strange fantasy 
       world.
-- Probably prepared his argument with Lionel Hutz,

% Homer points out that Marge should believe him, being his soulmate.
% However, that's the last thing she wants to hear.
%
% That night, Marge is sleeping alone upstairs, while Homer paces by the
% couch, wondering if Marge really is his soulmate.

Homer: We don't have anything in common.
        [opens the record cabinet, with "Marge" and "Homer" sections]
       Look at these records: Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown
       Pipers.  Now look at _her_ records!  They stink!

% Outside, Homer concludes that his soulmate is not to be found there,
% and walks away, dejected.

% Homer is laying on a sofa, speaking to a seated, well-dressed man.

Homer: I always just figured my wife was my soulmate.  But if it's not
       Marge, then who is it?  Where do I begin looking?
  Man: This really goes beyond my training as a furniture salesman, sir.
       Now if you don't want the sofa, I'll have to ask you to leave.

% Homer tries to find his soulmate via a pay phone...

Hello?  Is this... [reads his paper] GBM?  Uh, yeah.  I read in the

%
% The ship is commanded, of course, by Captain McAllister.

McAllister: Aye, the hot pants.
-- Precious to whom, I wonder, "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% In the lighthouse, creepy music plays while Homer giggles insanely.
% Suddenly, we hear footsteps, and the door opening.  It's Marge, who
% was worried when she woke up and Homer was gone.

Homer: But how did you find me?
Marge: Well, I was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public 
       transportation is for losers.  And I was sure you'd head west, 
       because Springfield slopes down that way.  And then, I saw the 
       lighthouse, and I remembered how you love blinking lights.  Like 
       the one on the waffle iron.
Homer: Or that little guy on the "Don't Walk" sign.
-- Nothing like bright, shiny things,

Homer: Wow, Marge, you really do understand me.  See, I thought we

-- "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"

% Homer's triumph is short-lived when he hears the ship coming near.
% They realize they have to get the light back on.  Marge checks the
% utility closet for spare bulbs.  After throwing away an empty box, she
% carries a new bulb up the ladder, and successfully installs it.

	    Hard a-starboard!
    Sailor: [just checking] Uh, port?
McAllister: [quietly] Aye, port.
-- "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"
