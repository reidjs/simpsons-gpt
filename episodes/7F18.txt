    ... the water slide schematic looks like the human digestive system?
    ... Bart was eating left-handed?
    ... the Picasso-style painting of Burns in the discard pile?
    ... the substantial number of curlers Marge needs?
    ... the string quartet played `For He's a Jolly Good Fellow' when
        Burns came in?
    ... this is Marge's second run-in with full frontal nudity?
    ... John Lovitz voiced Mr. Lombardo (the art teacher) and the donut
        delivery man?
    ... Ringo said `gear!' when he saw Marge's painting?

[Jym Dyer]
    ... that they're reading the `Springfield Shopper' in the
        first new episode to air since `Simpsons Illustrated' was released?

[Scott Amspoker]
    ... the runners up in the art contest? ("dogs playing ping pong" and
        the sad unicorn asking "Why?")
    ... the number of different "camera shots" in which the genitalia
        in Mr. Burns' portrait were kept hidden from view?  It was so
        conspicious it became a joke in itself.

[rjc]
        Here's the list of things that blocked the view of Mr. Burns'
        privates:
            the feather of a woman's hat
            Burns' head
            Marge's hairdo
            Marge's head
            Marge's hand
            Marge's upper lip
            Marge's wine glass
            Dr. Hibert's wine glass
            Smithers' head

And for those who weren't sure of Lisa's age, Marge says, ``Mr. Burns, it's
hard to discover your inner beauty while you're shouting at an eight-year-old
girl.''

Gary Bisaga observes:

Right before Burns insults Homer's new reduced waistline, Homer is shown
standing in front of the staircase and two pictures are shown on the wall
behind him.  One appears to be a baby picture of Bart, on all fours but with
the same spike hair.  The other appears to be a female ancestor of Marge's,
looking just like Marge; she had blue hair done up like Marge's (and her
mother's) current style, except it didn't go up nearly as far - more of an
afro with a little peak on the top.  It was in a little ellipsical frame.
The picture appears to be from the early part of the 20th century because
the dress she is wearing has mutton sleeves (those big puffy shoulder/sleeve
units that they wore back then).  But the picture was in color (you can see
the hair is blue).  They probably would not have given the woman that type of
dress unless they were attempting to portray a picture from, say, the 20's,
so I say the picture should have been B/W.  What does everybody else say?

===============================================================================
>> Audrey Rosen kindly provides the jumprope rhyme:

    Lincoln, Lincoln, I've been thinkin'
    What the heck have you been drinkin'?
    Is it water?  Is it wine?
    Oh my gosh, it's turpentine!

Except that Lisa and Bart say `hell' instead of `heck', just to give it
a little more edge.

===============================================================================
> Assorted comments and observations
===============================================================================
Chris Baird {cjb} notes that paintings of Monty Burns already existed,
such as the painting of a younger (blushing) Burns in his office in
`Homer's Odyssey'.

-- The persistence of memory? ``Brush with Greatness''

% Homer has trouble fitting into his swimsuit (which doesn't leave much to
% the imagination), nor does he find it easy to get into the car without
% his spare tire hitting the horn.  When they arrive...

Everybody stick together.  We don't want to get separ...
[turns around, everybody is gone]  D'oh!
-- Homer's instructions to the family at Mt. Splashmore,

H2WHOA!

Bart: Okay, Lis.  Turn on the water works, babe.
Lisa: [crying] Mommy!  I want my mommy! [sob sob]
-- How to get to the front of the line for a ride at Mt. Splashmore,
   ``Brush with Greatness''

% Lisa, then Bart go down.  Marge watches Maggie in the kiddie pool.
% Homer gets to the front of the H2WHOA line by claiming to be the
% line inspector, and when he goes down, he gets stuck.  One technician
% notes, ``It's too big to be human'' and tells the spotter to send
% down some kids to dislodge it.  They don't, and the section of pipe
% has to be removed to get Homer out.  The family watch the TV news.

Eyewitnesses estimate the man's weight at somewhere between four and
five hundred pounds.
-- Newscaster on Homer's getting stuck in the water slide,
   ``Brush with Greatness''

Krusty: [surrounded by reporters]
        No, this slide is perfectly safe.  This was an isolated incident.
Kent Brockman:  I understand that Krusty... [lost in the reporters' yelling]
        Krusty!  Was that exactly what you said just before the recall of
        tainted `Krusty Brand Mayonnaise'?
Krusty: Now kids, you know that question is out of bounds.
        This interview is over.
-- ``Brush with Greatness''

Homer:  All right, family.  I want the truth.  Don't pull any punches.
        [sweetly]  Am I just a little bit overweight?
        [silence]
        [angrily] Well, am I?
Lisa:   Forgive us, Dad, but it takes time to properly sugar-coat a response.
-- Ooh, and a split infinitive, too, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Homer weighs himself.

Oh!  Four hundred and thirty-seven...  Fifty pounds?
Oh my God!  Three hundred and...  A hundred and fifty?
OH! Ooh. OH! Ooh.
Oh my God!  It's two hundred and sixty pounds!
I'm a big fat pig!
-- The ups and downs of dieting with a shaky scale, ``Brush with Greatness''

Marge: You do have big bones.
Homer: Marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bones!
-- Homer finds he weighs 260 pounds, ``Brush with Greatness''

I am going on a diet.
From this day forward, I pledge there will be no pork chop too succulent!
No donut too tasty!
No pizza too laden with delicious toppings
to prevent me from reaching my scientifically-determined ideal weight!
As God as my witness, I'll always be hungry again!!
-- Homer, upon realizing he needs to lose weight, ``Brush with Greatness''

% then his stomach growls. [End of Act 1.  Time: 5:38]

% Bart stumbles across a large cache of paintings of Ringo Starr, signed
% by `Marge B.', one of which depicts Ringo and Marge getting married.

       The Beatles were very popular, and I had a crush on him.
Homer: A likely story...
-- Marge explains her collection of Ringo Starr paintings,
   ``Brush with Greatness''

% At dinner...

Oh, why did I have to start my diet on pork chop night?
-- Homer, setting out on his diet, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Marge gives Homer steamed vegetables and rice cakes.

Hey, I've been setting my drinks on these things!
-- Homer admires a rice cake, ``Brush with Greatness''

Hello!  Hello!  Hello, taste?  Where are you?
-- Homer bites into a rice cake, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Marge suggests Homer could put something on it for flavor.

Hey Mom, these paintings are good.
While I know first-hand how fragile young talent is,
I'd love to hear the particulars of how <your> gift was squashed.
-- Lisa asking Marge to explain her schoolgirl painting talent,
   ``Brush with Greatness''

% Marge tells her story of how Mr. Schindler scolded her for drawing Ringo,
% and how she sent Ringo a picture of him for an honest opinion.  But she
% never got any response and never painted again.

Lisa:  Maybe you could take a class at Springfield Community College.
Marge: I think it's a very nice idea.  Don't you, Homer?
Homer: Do I have to do anything?
Marge: No.
Homer: Great!  Fine!  Go nuts!
-- A loving, supportive husband, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Homer takes his rice cake out of the microwave, loaded with goodies.
% ``Mm.  Only 35 calories.''  At SCC...

I've just enrolled in the screenwriting class.

pushed too far by convenience store bandits.
I call it `Hands Off My Jerky, Turkey'.
-- Apu, at Springfield Community College, ``Brush with Greatness''

% With Lisa's moral support, Marge shows Prof. Lombardo her portfolio
% and he lets her enrol in the painting class.

Marvelous!
-- Prof. Lombardo sees a handyman paint the handrail, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Homer is wearing weights on his wrists and ankles, and he can't move.
% Bart takes advantage of the situation and takes Homer's wallet.  Back
% at SCC...

Now, using the Lombardo method, you learn to see everyday objects
as a simple grrouping of geometrical shapes.  Heah, we see how two
concentric circles, various trapezoids, ellipses, and yes! even a rrhombus!
can create an adorable little bunny-rabbit.  It's just that easy!
-- Professor Lombardo's art lecture, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Homer tries to lift weights, he skips rope with Bart and Lisa (as Marge
% `visualizes' him geometrically), and he tries a second time to lift
% weights, and suceeds after all the weights fall off and he raises just the
% bar.  At SCC...

Bravo!  Walk away from it.  Now it belongs to the ages.
[to next student]
You!  Not another stroke!  Oh well, maybe one more, that's it!  Perfect!
-- Professor Lombardo's art lecture, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Prof. Lombardo is very impressed with Marge's work and enters her `Bald
% Adonis' in the Springfield Art Exhibition.

Marge, please, I don't take praise very well!
[sees a sign painter]
Oh!  Another triumph!
-- Prof. Lombardo, ``Brush with Greatness''

% At the art show, Marge wins first prize.  At the power plant, Burns
% bawls out yet another artist hired to paint his portrait for the
% opening of the Burns Wing of the museum.  Smithers discards the painting
% into a room filled with other failed paintings.

Damnation, Smithers.  This idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait
was as half-baked as your idea about me having children!
-- Burns chews out Smithers, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Smithers notes that Burns has alienated every artist in town.  Then suggests

Smithers: Mrs. Homer Simpson.
Burns:    Who?
Smithers: She won first prize in the Springfield Art Fair,
          and she's the wife of an employee, she'll be easily
          intimidated.
Burns:    Excellent.

Marge:  Kids, remember what I told you about showing a little support?
Lisa:   Way to go, Dad!
Bart:   You look mahvelous!
Maggie: [toasts Homer with her bottle of formula]
-- Homer reaches his weight goal, ``Brush with Greatness''

% At the plant...

Donut man:  Hey, what gives?  These donuts are piling up.
Worker:     Heh.  Yeah, Homer Simpson went on a diet.
Donut man:  Oh my God.  And I just bought a boat! [slaps forehead]
-- Homer's diet depresses the local economy, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Burns struggles to rap the knocker on the Simpsons' door, and Smithers
% bangs on the door until Marge answers.  They invite themselves in.

Smithers:  Have you ever painted the rich and powerful?
Marge:     Well, no.  Just Ringo Starr.
Burns:     Ring-Go?
Smithers:  He was the drummer for a rock-and-roll combo called
           the Beatles, sir.
Burns:     Beatles, eh?  Oh, yes.  I seem to remember their off-key
           caterwauling on the old Sullivan show.  What <was> Ed thinking?
-- Burns commissions Marge to paint his portrait, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Burns requires that Marge make him look beautiful, and she agrees.

-- Preparing for a portrait, ``Brush with Greatness''

% Homer arrives home and panics when he sees Burns.  He takes Marge into

% that all she needs to do is find his inner beauty.  She returns to work.

Marge:  What were you like as a boy, Mr. Burns?
        Did you have a dog that you loved?
Burns:  Well...  Daah!  There's something on my leg.  [waves his leg]
        Get it off!  Get it off!  [Maggie is clutching his leg]  Ugh!
Marge:  [takes Maggie, holds her up] Mr. Burns, she's just a baby.

Burns:    Heh heh.  Ah, Ziggy.  Will you ever win?

Smithers: Oh ho ho.  Actually, I value every second we're together.
          From the moment I squeeze his orange juice in the morning,
          til I tuck him in at night.
          He's not just my boss.  He's my best friend, too.
