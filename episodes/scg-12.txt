[==========================[Season Twelve Summary]==========================]

Story cut episodes: All except CABF04, CABF02, BABF22, CABF14, CABF17.
Compressed episodes: BABF21, BABF17, CABF01, CABF04, CABF02, CABF22, CABF12,
                     CABF11, CABF14, CABF16, CABF17.
Expanded episodes: BABF20, CABF03, CABF05, CABF08, CABF10, CABF09, CABF13.
Changed content: CABF12, CABF09, CABF16.

Total time cut: 24:50 (24 min 50 sec)
Story time cut: 6:35 (6 min 35 sec)
Total time gained: 24:54 (24 min 54 sec)

Notes: I had a hard time finding the original end credit timings for most of
       the season 12 episodes. I used the section Fox broadcasts to estimate
       the length and any compression for those, and marked the "ending"
       lines with asterisks; if you have any information on them, please let
       me know.

Update: 4/6/09: Tim Reardon mentions that BABF20 and BABF17 are too short as
        described here, with some cuts/compression not in his synd versions.
        That's probably accurate. My synd versions are from WUAB, 9/9/02, and
        were probably shortened by the station (a no-no!) by 30 seconds each.
        I will adjust the SCG when I can do a proper comparison.

         Marge: I love what you've done with these poles!
         Homer: [sniffing sounds]

<1.5>  % Chimps are seen. Two are grooming, one walks over and sits down,
       % and another one swings out of a tree and hangs on the branch.
         Pan from this scene to the Simpsons and Joan watching the chimps.

          Joan: Every day I get up at 5:30, watch the chimps, eat a quick
                lunch of roots and water, then more chimp watching. After
                dark, I come home and think about chimps until it's time for
                bed.
         Homer: You must be the most boring woman on earth!
          Joan: Possibly, but--
         Homer: I mean, I knew scientists wasted their _lives_! But jeez!
         Marge: [elbowing him] Homer!

         A chimp jumps out of a tree, pointing and shrieking in alarm.

<0:01> %              What is it, Pointy?

         Cut to overhead shot, then pan to show a truck rolling up. The truck

       % then tilts it toward Bart.
                                    Bart lights a lighter under the bomb.

 ~~
         Marge and Lisa shoot bees at the tires of the truck. They blow out,
         then the car explodes.
<0:01> %                        Homer picks up a chimp from the ground and
       % places it on a bent-down tree.

         Homer: Somebody light this monkey!

 ~~
         Lisa notices Joan's diamond-encrusted pen and notepad.

         Joan: They were a graduation present!

<0:01> % A man stands next to the mine hole, then walks over to it.
         He clicks on a flashlight and looks down the shaft.

          Man: Unbelieveable!

       ! This cut and the last were actually less than a second, but close
       ! enough to round up. Thanks, syndicators!
