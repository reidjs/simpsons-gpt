Blackboard :- Teacher is not a leper.
              Teacher is not a le/ at cutoff.

Lisa's Solo:- Present, but exact notes unknown.

Couch      :- The family run on and do a chorus line.  They're joined by
              a line of Rockette-type women.  As the camera pulls back,
              the back wall of the living room is lifted up to reveal
              elephants doing handstands on one front leg, magicians
              pulling rabbits out of hats, and other assorted circus
              performers.  The music throughout sounds as though it's
              from a circus.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> The couch scene

Juha Terho writes, "Matt Groening has stated that he wanted this couch
    sequence to be the best of all.  I didn't like it, perhaps because
    it was too long and poorly animated.  Anyway, MG seems to like it so
    much, that the couch sequence was recycled in three other episodes,
    9F13, 9F16 and 9F22.  (No other couch gag has been used for more
    than thrice.)"

>> "Girls Just Want to Have Fun"

Ricardo Lafaurie recognizes this as a token hit song of the 1980's (from
    1983) "by the omni-haircolored Cyndi Lauper.  She followed this with
    a few more hits from her album `She's So Unusual', but Lauper is
    indeed a figure of the '80s."

>> "Where's the Beef?"

Ricardo Lafaurie says, "Popularized by the Wendy's commercial, Walter
    Mondale, a Presidential nominee, posed this question to Gary Hart
    looking for some meat in Hart's campaign.  This boosted Mondale to a
    nomination (but he didn't win)."  The Wendy's commercial features an
    old woman (played by Clara Peller) on a boat yelling into a phone,
    "Where's the beef?!", implying that other hamburger chains' burgers
    don't have substantial amounts of meat in them.  It did well for
    Wendy's, the commercial did.

>> Maggie's first word?  Hardly!

Ricardo Lafaurie summarizes, "Some say that Maggie has spoken on `The
    Simpsons' before, but it can easily be rebuked.  Maggie's `It's your
    fault I can't talk!' in `Bart vs. Thanksgiving' was a figment of
    Bart's imagination.  `Moe' in `Flaming Moe's' was a hallucination.
    And Maggie `talking' in `Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?' was
    thanks to Herb Powell's baby translator (which probably was
    successful for a few weeks and then flopped, apparently.)
    
    But on `The Tracey Ullman Show' shorts, Maggie talked consisently,
    from the very beginning!  (She says `Goo' ni', da'' in `Good Night')
    Another time she talked was in `Making Faces' (`Check this out'),
    and she often babbled too (e.g.  `House of Cards': `Dooey shooey
    gaven mush').  But then again, Homer didn't have an apparent job,
    and Marge didn't have a name.  So let's call the whole thing off."

>> Recycled animation

The shots of Homer sawing and hammering are lifted directly from 8F13,
    "Homer at the Bat".

-- Too much chicken for Liz, "Lisa's First Word"

        Marge: Oh Maggie, when are you going to talk?
         Lisa: Well, don't push her.  Remember, it is better to remain
               silent and be thought a fool than open your mouth and
               remove all doubt.
Homer's brain: What does that mean?  Better say something or they'll
               think you're stupid.
        Homer: Takes one to know one.
Homer's brain: Swish!
-- Homer, non sequitur master, "Lisa's First Word"

Marge: According to Fretful Mother Magazine, if Maggie doesn't talk at
       age one, we should consider a corrective tongue extender.
-- And then she can be the world's youngest Gene Simmons, "Lisa's First
    Word"

% Bart wants to know what his first word was.  We flash back to Bart
% coming into the parents' bedroom at the wrong time and baby Bart
% exclaiming, "Ay, caramba!"  In the present, Marge finishes lamely, "I
% don't remember..."

    Marge: The story of Lisa's first word is very cute.
Bart+Lisa: Tell it, Mom!  Tell it, Mom!  Tell it!
    Homer: Yeah.  Tell it, Mom!
-- Homer, caught up in the moment, "Lisa's First Word"

% Marge begins, "This story begins in the unforgettable spring of 1983.
% Ms.  Pacman struck a blow for women's rights and a young Joe Piscopo
% taught us how to laugh."  Flashback to the turbulent 80's in East
% Springfield.  We see some boys go to play stick ball -- the video
% game.  Marge and Bart are waiting for Homer to come home from work.
% Marge chats about M*A*S*H with the neighbors.  (Homer, Marge and Bart
% live in an apartment.)
%
% Enter Homer, singing Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Want To Have Fun".

 Bart: Homer!
Homer: Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.  Homer's what grownups call me.  Call me
       daddy.
 Bart: Homer.
Homer: Daddy.
 Bart: Homer.
Homer: [increasingly irate] Daddy.
 Bart: Da...da...da...
Homer: Yes?
 Bart: D'omer!  Hah, hah, hah...
Homer: Why you little...[chokes Bart]
-- Homer practices tongue extension on Bart, "Lisa's First Word"

% A montage follows.  Bart leaps on a sleeping Homer.  They eat
% spaghetti together.  Bart horrifies the parents by hanging (naked)
% from a clothesline over a 40-feet drop to the street.  He swings
% around and around, enjoying himself immensely -- so much so that he
% continues swinging for many hours, well into the evening, as the
% parents watch from the window.
%
% Marge tells young Bart a bedtime story.

Marge: Then the prince and the princess...[yawn] got married and lived
       happily ever after.
 Bart: Then what happened?
Marge: Uh...they had thirty sons and thirty daughters.
 Bart: What were their names?
Marge: Hmm...Dennis...Brad...Mavis...Brad...[asleep]
-- They must have been Catholic, "Lisa's First Word"

% Bart decides to flip on Johnny Carson; he laughs and imitates Ed

%
% The next day, Homer plays with his son.

Homer: Got your nose!  Heh heh heh.
 Bart: Got your wallet!  [flushes down toilet]
-- Precocious, ain't he, "Lisa's First Word"

% Homer then orders him never to do that again, but Bart just beeps
% Homer's nose.  Enter Marge.

Marge: There's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is
       now!
Homer: We're going to start doing it in the morning?!
-- Slow on the uptake, "Lisa's First Word"

% Bzzzt.  She's awaiting another baby.  Homer's keys are flushed down
% the but Marge doesn't seem to care.  "Hear that, Bart?  You're going
% to have a little brother or sister to play with!"  Bart imagines the
% possibilities.
%
% Marge is becoming as big as a house, so they talk about their future.

Marge: I'm afraid we're going to need a bigger house.
Homer: No, we won't.  I've got it all figured out.  The baby can have
       Bart's crib and Bart'll sleep with us until he's 21.
Marge: Won't that warp him?
Homer: My cousin Frank did it.
Marge: You don't have a cousin Frank.
Homer: He became Francine back in '76.  Then he joined that cult.  I
       think her name is Mother Shabubu now.

%
% Homer and Marge visit Stinking Fish Realty.  But they have problems
% finding a proper house -- or the proper neighborhood.  The first one
% is too violent.  The second house is located next to a rendering
% plant.  ("Mmm...hog fat").  {The third one is Captain McAllister's
% houseboat, where the good Captain's sales pitch is interrupted while
% he wrestles a Great White.}  And the fourth is full of cats.

Marge: Once we get the cats out of the way, it won't be too bad
Agent: Actually, according to the will, the cats own the house.  You'd
       be their tenants!
-- "Lisa's First Word"

Lisa: I wish we lived in the kitty house.
Bart: I could've trained them to be my unholy army of the night.  Go, my
      pretties!  Kill!  Kill!
-- The Wicked Bart of the West, "Lisa's First Word"

% "We were about to give up, but then we found the house that was
% perfect"...on Evergreen Terrace.  In Homer's mind's eye, he visualizes
% adding a TV and couch to the living room and grins.  But he needs to
% be able to afford the place first, so he heads off to see his father.

Homer: Dad, I have a problem.
  Abe: Why did you come to me?  I don't know nothin'.  I used to get by
       on my looks.  Now they're gone...withered away like an old piece
       of fruit...[cries]
Homer: Are you done?
-- Homer, sympathy king, "Lisa's First Word"

 Homer: I need $15,000 to buy a home.

        hands.
 Homer: You didn't build this house.  You won it on a crooked 50's game
        show.
Grampa: I ratted on everybody and got off scott free!  Hah-hah!  [They
        exchange high-fives]
-- The $15,000 Question, "Lisa's First Word"

Grampa: All right, son, I'll sell this dump and write you a check.

Grampa: Thank you!
  Bart: [in the present] So how long before you shipped Grampa off to
        the old-folks home?
 Homer: About three weeks.

            events.  How does this affect our giveaway?
Accountant: Let's see.  [calculates] You personally stand to lose $44
            million.
-- As long as he never bets against the Globetrotters, "Lisa's First
    Word"

% Bart refuses to give up his crib to the new baby, even after much
% pulling and reverse psychology from Homer, so Homer builds him a new
% bed -- a clown bed.  "Homer J. Simpson, you're a genius."  Only the
% clown is grotesque and frightening looking.  Homer reassures Bart
% he'll be able to laugh himself to sleep, but Bart imagines the clown
% intoning with barely-suppressed evil glee, "If you should die before
% you wake..."

Bart: Can't sleep, clown'll eat me...Can't sleep, clown'll eat me...
-- Bart laughs himself to sleep, "Lisa's First Word"

% The family watch the Olympics.

Announcer: And we're seconds away from the 100-meter butterfly.  While
           the East German, heh heh, "women", are shaving their backs
           three thousand miles away, the Americans are heavy favorites.
-- The 1984 Olympics butterfly competition, "Lisa's First Word"

% Homer's stomach grumbles.  "Patience, my pet."  The butterfly begins,
% but half of the contestants are about to drown because they come from
% countries that don't have swimming pools.  The other announcer
% comments sarcastically, "Boo hoo, you're breaking my heart!"

Marge: Homer, I think the baby is coming.
Homer: Wow.  A baby and a free burger.  Could this be the best day of my
       life?
   TV: Next up, an hour-long episode of "Mama's Family".
Homer: Yess!
-- The day he skips church is eight years away, "Lisa's First Word"

% Ned, Todd and Rod are with Bart saying bye to Homer and Marge, who
% leave for the hospital.

     Ned: We'll take good care of your boy, Simpson.  Enjoy the miracle
          of creation!
   Homer: Shut up, Flanders.  [drives off]
     Ned: So, what d'you kids wanna play?
Rod+Todd: "Good Samaritan!"
-- Gotta start 'em young, "Lisa's First Word"

% At the Flanders' home...

Todd: I get to clothe the leper.
 Rod: Lucky!
 Ned: Supper time, boys!
Todd: Oh boy: liver!
 Rod: Iron helps us play.
-- "Good Samaritan" and dinner at the Flanderses, "Lisa's First Word"

% Bart says he wants back home, but changes his mind after seeing his
% scary bed through the window.
%
% Bed-time.  Todd and Rod sing religious songs ("I've got some joy, joy,
% joy, joy down in my heart.  (Where?)  Down in my heart to stay!  And
% if the devil doesn't like it, he can sit on a tack.  (Ouch!)  Sit on a
% tack.  (Ouch!)"), so Bart decides to sneak away.  On the way, he
% happens to run into a very old Grandma Flanders, who scares him.
% ("Hello, Joe!  Can you help me with my psalms?")
%
% After Lisa's birth, Homer gives Lisa the good news: he's already
% started her college fund at Lincoln Savings & Loan.  Marge reads
% Fretful Mother Magazine.

Marge: According to this magazine, Bart might be jealous of her [Lisa].
Homer: Well, Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt.
-- Mmm...hairy yellow, "Lisa's First Word"

% Back at home, Bart is puzzled.  He imagines talking heads flying
% around him ("From now on the baby sleeps in the crib", "Iron helps us
% play", Evil Clown laughter, and "Hello, Joe!").  Homer interrupts
% Bart's hallucinations by asking him to come and see Little Lisa.
% Marge sits in a rocking chair, holding Lisa, with light streaming
% through the curtains.  Lisa wakes up, yawning.  The scene is adorable.
% "Well, Bart, what do you think of Little Lisa?"  Marge asks
% expectantly.  "I hate you," spits Bart.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 15:33]

Marge: I saved this newspaper from the day Lisa was born.
 Lisa: "Mondale to Hart: [confused] Where's the beef?"
 Bart: "Where's the beef?"  What the hell that's supposed to mean?
Homer: Heh heh heh heh heh.  "Where's the beef"...No wonder he won
       Minnesota.
-- Homer, savvy politico, "Lisa's First Word"

% Marge continues her story.  "Everyone agreed that Lisa was a beautiful
% baby."  Back to the flashbacks.  Patty and Selma, smoking, have come
% to see Lisa.

Patty: Isn't that cute.  She's coughing.
-- Wait 'til she spits up, "Lisa's First Word"

% Selma gives Lisa a kiss -- a close-up of her face makes most of us
% puke.  Bart tries to gain attention by singing Allouette, but isn't
% noted.  "You still here?"

Patty: The older they get, the cuter they ain't.
-- The universal truth as told by a Bouvier spinster, "Lisa's First
    Word"

% The Gruesome Twosome concentrate on Lisa.  "Hey, the baby just spit
% up!" notes Selma cheerfully.
%
% Homer follows the last day of the 24th Olympiad, brought to you by
% Krusty Burger _tm_.  Krusty appears, smoking and crying.  "You people
% are pigs!  I, personally, am going to spit in every fiftieth burger!"
% Homer doesn't worry.  "I like those odds."
%
% An announcer comes onscreen.

Announcer: In a moment, we'll look at the courageous Korean gymnast, Kim
           Huyang, who made a perfect dismount and which was later
           revealed to be...a broken leg!
   Huyang: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrgggggggggghh!
Announcer: [cheerfully] Ho ho ho ho hoo.  Ouch!
-- Watching sports, "Lisa's First Word"

% Homer watches boxing, in which Drederick Tatum has beaten a "supine
% Swede" (says Howard Cosell).  Homer dances around the room like Tatum
% when he realizes he has won a burger.
%
% {At a Krusty Burger, Homer, Wiggum and many others are receiving their
% free burgers.  "Carl Lewis, I could kiss you" comments Wiggum.}  Homer
% chants "USA!  USA!  USA!" and the crowds join in with him.
%
% Hibbert performs a little eye test on Lisa, who has a perfect vision.

Hibbert: Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.  She has the relexes of a young Mary
         Lou Retton.  Have a wowwipop.  [gives Lisa one]
   Bart: Can _I_ have a lollipop?
Hibbert: Oh Bart, I'm afraid that was the last one.  But I've got
         something even better for you: a rubella innoculation!
          [holds up a giant needle]
-- Ten-braided Hibbert and his medicine, "Lisa's First Word"

% Bart rubs his arm back at the house.

 Bart: I wanna hold the baby.  I wanna hold the baby.
Marge: I'm sorry, Bart, you're too little.
Homer: Here, Bart, you can hold my beer.
-- "Lisa's First Word"

% Lisa is put to bed.  Bart, who has sneaked into the room, brandishes
% some scissors.  Some time later, Marge comes in.  "Lisa, it's time for
% your feeding...aah!"  Bart has cut all of Lisa's hair off -- only
% stubble remains.  "Who's cuter now?"  Bart is sent to the corner.
%
% When Lisa's hair has grown back, Bart sticks stamps on Lisa and puts
% her in the mail box.  Later, he's back in the corner because the
% "Stupid mailman squealed on me..."
%
% Ned Flanders pays a visit, returning Lisa that Bart had stuck through
% the Flanders' doggy door.  Ned's attempt to get back his TV tray
% fails.  Homer orders Bart over to the corner, but then realizes he's
% already there.
%
% Bart prepares to run away from home.  Lisa is puzzled.  Bart explains
% that it was still fun when it was just Homer, Marge and him.

Bart: You wrecked everything.  I'm leaving.  Goodbye.
Lisa: Bart.
Bart: [amazed] What did you say?  Say it again!
Lisa: Bart.
Bart: Sufferin' Succotash!  You can talk!
Lisa: Goo.
-- Lisa's first word, "Lisa's First Word"

% Bart takes her downstairs to Homer and Marge.  Lisa demonstrates her
% newfound skill.  "Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart."  "I was her first
% word!"  Lisa can also say "Mommy", so Bart tries to get her to say the
% name of the actor on the "Knight Rider" cover of TV guide.

Bart: Can you say David Hasselhoff?
Lisa: Davah Hassa-hoff.
-- Lisa learns to talk, "Lisa's First Word"

Marge: Bart, don't write on the rug.
-- Lisa wasn't looking hard enough, "Lisa's First Word"
