   [TV Guide ad] Double page advertisement for CABF06 "Skinner's Sense of
   Snow". It features Homer Simpson stuck in a chimney with him remarking "Ho!
   Ho ... D'oh!"  Across the bottom it advertises four shows, including
   "Classic: The Simpsons -- Special Holiday Episode", a repeat of BABF07
   "Grift of the Magi" as well as "All New!  The Simpsons -- Springfield Gets
   Snowed In!", this weeks new episode.

Blackboard:     SCIENCE CLASS SHOULD NOT / END IN TRAGEDY

Couch:          A football bounces into view, followed by all five Simpsons,
                wearing uniforms.  One by one, they all jump on it.  Maggie
                pops out of the pile with the ball.  She spikes it and does a
                little victory dance.

> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================

Don Del Grande:
   ... the reels on the projector don't move, which only makes sense as it's
       playing a DVD?
   ... while the school had a snow buildup, Homer's house did not?
   ... one of the kids said "Oh my God" when the bicycle got loose?
   ... whoever gives the rating at the beginning of the show didn't consider
       the joke about "slap around your Willie" suggestive enough to rate it
       PG-L?
   ... in Skinner's Vietnam flashback, he's a Sergeant, despite the truth as
       revealed in 4F23?
   ... Bart's permanent record has its own binder?  (Didn't it have its own
       file drawer once?)  [Tom Restivo speculates, "After Grade School
       Confidential (4F09), he might have gotten his Permanent Record Drawer
       expunged, only to work his way back up to a binder."]
   ... they managed to get through a Christmas episode without anybody singing
       a carol?

Ahmet Deligonul:
   ... Springfield Elementary is rich enough to afford an unreliable and
       unsafe yet functioning DVD player?
   ... one of Nelson's lackeys way back from "Bart the General" is in the
       classroom!
   ... the "Permanent Records" room has more security now (and is smaller)?
   ... Bart regained his original bad permanent record?  He got his record
       switched with Milhouse's in "Grade School Confidential"

Darrel Jones:
   ... Apu makes a snow Vishnu?
   ... during Homer's final hallucination, Bart's hair looks like a blonde
       version of Princess Kashmir's?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Maggie doing a touchdown dance?
   ... the cracker factory guard is a Scorpio?

Haynes Lee:
   ... this is the fifth Xmas-themed episode? (meaning a solid week of reruns
       for next year)

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Homer has evidently switched his football allegiance from the Dallas
       Cowboys?
   ... at the circus, someone behind Homer is wearing a ND (Notre Dame?)
       sweater?
   ... someone was heads-up enough to draw the kids' coats folded on their
       laps, rather than simply having them disappear?
   ... Lisa was pretty eager to get at the forbidden permanent records?
   ... on the other hand, she wasn't impressed by Skinner's salary?

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Steve Alpert:  From "I hope it's Flanders" to the lack of a farfetched ending
   (compared to what we've been seeing), this was the best in the last several
   seasons.  Just having a Bart-centered episode, where Bart's at his best,
   makes it an A right off the bat.  "What's that?  You want a pee bucket on
   your head?"  His ability to encourage revolution and to make the most of it
   are played up for once, ending his stereotype of just being the dumb one.
   His plan to dig his way out, his adorable attempt to wear the uniform and
   command Skinner like Skinner commanded him, and Nelson's role as enforcer
   of the peace all enhanced the episode.  (A+)

Don Del Grande:  Not only was it your typical "go through the motions"
   episode, but they made it worse by sticking a "Merry Christmas" bit at the
   end of it (well, maybe that's a blessing in disguise, as now they probably
   won't repeat it this season).  (B-)

Ahmet Deligonul:  Wow, a nice episode.  The circus thing coulda been replaced
   by something better that lead to the awareness of the blizzard though.
   Hopefully the rest of the season will be entertaining like this ...  (A-)

Ben Fonter:  Well, although this episode certainly wasn't without the
   weirdness that Season 12 has become known for, the weirdness tonight was at
   an acceptable level.  I'm soo happy this episode wasn't Homercentric, like
   so many others in the recent past.  This episode was inventive of the
   writers.  Imagine, undestroyable permanent records. It was funny that Homer
   couldn't remember his own snow plowing career. And the sick jokes just made
   me laugh harder at this obnoxiously funny episode.  [...] It worked!  But,
   I slightly feel abused. Anyway, this was a cheery episode, which I could
   follow well for the most part.  So I give it a solid  (B+)

Carl Johnson:  Sunday's episode was a few small pieces of bark torn from the
   glorious trees of episodes past, attached by a whole lot of boring,
   humorless glue, and the result is barely gradable.  This one doesn't even
   have the capacity to lie among such Worst Episodes Ever as "Monty Can't Buy
   Me Love", "Screaming Yellow Honkers," or "Little Big Mom", but I
   nonetheless give "Skinner's Sense of Snow" a low  (D-)

Darrel Jones:  I love it!  It's crazy, but it works.  It was wonderful to
   finally see the kids rebel against Skinner, and not have any retaliation or
   long-term hard feelings from him, for once.  Homer's subplot, though too
   brief, was cool, especially the hallucinations.  (LOVED the "ranch dressing
   hose"!) Too wacky for classic status, but good holiday fun nonetheless.
   9/10  (A)

Joe Klemm:  After a good one last year, the Simpsons return to their tradition
   of crappy Xmas episodes.  The concept of the kids being snowed in at school
   was a bad idea to begin with, and it was made even worse with Skinner's
   bossiness. Luckily, the Cirque the Puree bit and the funny third act saved
   this from getting a D or lower.  Personally, I would have aired this year's
   Futurama Xmas episode instead of this.  (C-)

Adam Long:  I liked it.  There were lots of old-timey elements, such as the
   interaction with the kids at SES, and Skinner's flashbacks to Vietnam.  The
   plot was good as well, nothing wacky and outlandish.  Lots of good gags,
   the laughter was pretty consistent throughout, but there were some failed
   ones as well. (Unfortunately I didn't tape it so I can't go over it and
   give specific examples)  Overall I thought it was pretty good, and this
   season is showing a refreshing change.  But some old season 10-11 habits
   bring it to a  (B+)

Michael Nusair:  Hmm ...  After a couple of pretty mediocre episodes in a row,
   we get ... Another mediocre episode.  This one, however, is leaning much
   closer to "good" than it is to "bad."  The first act wasn't so great, with
   a bunch of awkward jokes that didn't really work.  It picked up in the
   second and third acts, though, which were actually pretty funny.  Homer
   saying -- almost on reflex -- "I hope that was Flanders!" followed by him
   looking sheepishly at Ned, was hilarious, I thought.  Definitely one of the
   funniest moments in a while.  However, some jokes, like those in the
   aforementioned first act, weren't so great.  If I had a better memory, I'd
   cite a few examples.  But I don't.  Anyway, CABF06 may not have been a
   great episode, but it certainly wasn't bad, either.  (B)

Mike Reed:  Not the best of the season (still CABF01) but dang close to it.
   The circus part, while undeniably funny had absolutely nothing to do with
   the plot, which makes me think it was just there to fill up space.  Once
   the kids got snowed in school, the plot went great.  I loved the movie, and
   most of the jokes were great.  My only complaint is that there seems to be
   too many low-brow jokes this season.  (I can think of four from this
   episode alone.)  But that's not going to stand in the way of a great review
   of this one.  (A)

Robert Todd:  Well, It wasn't a bad episode, Skinner's favourite film was
   good, and the wackiness wouldn't have looked out of place in season 4.
   Even better, no guest stars!  However Homer's attempt to rescue the Kids
   (stealing Ned's roof) and the Hallucination definitely took it down.
   Finally, Why all the double entendres?  (B-)

Todd Willis:  This episode one of the better ones I've seen in a while.  The
   plot was fairly simple, but effective, and led to enough jokes that I
   enjoyed.  I few parts of the episode were a little mediocre, but the
   overall quality was well above average.  The ending was a little too
   simple, and the "Merry Christmas" was lame.  (A-)

Fox Wolf:  This episode will be hard to beat for future episodes.  It's been a
   long time since I've seen an episode this good, the funny kind of good.
   The name "Cirque du Puree" really amused me, as did the whole circus bit,
   but it would be nice to have the beginning relevant to the rest of the
   episode for once.  The plot, although it seemed too much like a blend of
   "Mountain of Madness" and "Kamp Krusty", was well done.  All in all, it was
   an excellent episode, a little wacky, but at least it had a logical
   conclusion with that hilarious Camel-Lisa thing.  I give it an  (A)

Yours Truly:  This episode represents one of those rare times when a good
   premise falls flat.  Skinner and some of the students are trapped in SES
   after a severe snowstorm.  When he lays down strict rules to keep the
   peace, the kids rebel.  The setup is a natural -- and that may actually be
   the problem.  These "natural" ideas often suggest an obvious resolution
   and, sometimes, the obvious way to go isn't the best one.  I liked the more
   offbeat parts of the story, like the teaming of Homer and Flanders, or the
   weird Christmas film Skinner shows the kids.  If the rest of the story took
   the same unusual tack, it would've rated higher.  (C+)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Musical References

Andrew Levine:  "Feel Like Making Love" by Bad Company (1975 song) -- Homer
   didn't actually write it, but he sings it in the car.


Darrel Jones adds:  [The] real writers are Bad Company's Mick Ralphs and Paul
   Rodgers.


Benjamin Robinson:  "Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow" is heard during
   the wild bus ride to school.  I'm guessing it's the Dean Martin version.


>> Meta-reference corner

Benjamin Robinson:  Bart's permanent record sums him up as an, "underachiever,
   and proud of it."  This was also the tag line for just about every piece of
   Bart merchandise, circa 1991.  It hasn't been used in a while, a fact
   reflected in Bart's comment, "How old is *this*?"


>> What?  No bearded lady?

Benjamin Robinson explains:  To most people, "circus" conjures up images of
   clowns, exotic animals, and exotic people performing under the big top.
   Cirque de Soleil (CdS) aims to change that.  Like Cirque de Purée, CdS
   shuns the use of animals, on the grounds that they are poorly suited for
   circus life. Instead, they entertain the crowd with acrobatic stunts done
   on fanciful sets, enhanced with special effects.  Their act looks similar
   to what we saw in this episode, only splashier, if you can believe it. (At
   their permanent show in Las Vegas, they have a pool with raised platforms
   that make it appear as if the performers can even walk on water!)

   As you might imagine, that sort of wizardry doesn't come cheap.  That Las
   Vegas show is a US$100 ticket, while a troupe in Orlando charges US$65 (or
   more) for its show.  Springfield splits the difference at US$80.  CdS
   doesn't move around that much, something alluded to when Marge mentions the
   family has only eight months to see Cirque de Purée's show.  Lately, CdS
   has been moving to permanent installations such as the ones in Orlando and
   Las Vegas, where they can perform in purpose-built -- and presumably
   weather-resistant -- stadiums.

   CdS was founded by French Canadians.  Their Gallic heritage shows in the
   art deco and art noveau sets and costuming, the avant-garde sense of
   whimsy, and in the mildly existentialist atmosphere surrounding the show.
   It also explains Homer's "French Circus" pennant.


>> Twelve Feet Of Snow?  School Opening Delayed Five Minutes

Jeff Cross reminisces:  I can understand Bart's annoyance at every other
   school being cancelled in the wake of the blizzard.  Growing up, my town's
   school superintendent was from the Minnesota, where what we Massachusetts
   people called a "blizzard" was considered a "flurry," and would very rarely
   cancel school when the snow really started pouring down.

   I later went to a private high school three towns over which had students
   coming in as far as Maine; all it would take to get a cancellation was the
   highways icing over.  In my junior year the snow was really coming down
   hard one day, and the radio cancellation lists didn't mention my school.
   During the ride in we were constantly switching radio stations to find out
   if we could go back; the towns we drove through had cancelled, and still we
   were on.  Only when we got to the school did we learn we'd been cancelled
   compliments of the assistant principal waving people off from the parking
   lot.


Benjamin Robinson adds:  I can sympathize with Bart and Lisa when Springfield
   Elementary decides to stay open.  It seems like the schools in my district
   would get caught off-guard by the first snow of the season, and would close
   even if only half an inch of snow had fallen.  Unfortunately, officials
   were only allowed to have so many snow days before they're forced to extend
   the school year to make up for it.  Inevitably, they'd run out of their
   allotment before they ran out of winter.  Also inevitably, there'd be one
   late-winter storm that would dump nine feet of snow on the town, shutting
   down everything *except* the school I went to.  Boy, what a morale booster
   it was to trudge off to school in weather that would keep polar explorers
   indoors!  Bart and Lisa, I feel your pain.


>> Cal Ripken -- the Principal Skinner of ballplayers

Joe Klemm:  Skinner's comment about Cal Ripken refers to his record streak.
   Referred to some as the Ironman, Cal Ripken, a member of the Baltimore
   Orioles, holds a record of the most consecutive baseball games played.
   From 1982 all the way to a couple of years ago, he has never missed a
   single baseball game.  In September,1995, he made the Major League Baseball
   record books as he surpassed the previous record held by Lou Gehrig.


Andrew Levine adds:  Ripken finally sat out a game on September 20, 1998,
   after 2,632 consecutive games played.


>> "The March of the Wooden Soldiers"

Joe Klemm describes this film:  The film that Skinner shows the class is
   similar to the Laurel and Hardy film, the March of the Wooden Soldiers.
   Based on the tale Babes in Toyland, the film features the duo as Stanley
   Dumb and Ollie Dee, two residents of Mother Goose Land.  There, they help
   Tom-Tom, the Pipers son and Little Bo Peep to fall in love while, with the
   help of giant wooden soldiers, saving the town from Barnaby, the Crooked
   Man, and the Bogie Men, man-beast creatures that the hobgoblins in the
   school film resemble.


>> I Want My DVD!

Haynes Lee:  DVD releases of some older movies are done with straight transfer
   from the film resulting in poor grainy image quality.  With no extra
   features you might as well have the video.


>> Now you know

Joe Klemm answers Ned's question:  Homer's plow was towed away, thus
   explaining where his plow went.


>> "What part of 'di di mau' don't you understand?"

Dung Nguyen explains it for us:  When Bart and Skinner are stuck in the school
   during the snowstorm, Skinner became Bart's prisoner. Referring to
   Skinner's experience during the Vietnam War, Bart used a Vietnamese phrase
   when he was commanding Skinner. The phrase is "DI DI MAU," which literally
   means "go faster," but Vietnamese speakers usually use "DI MAU."  The
   repetition of the word "DI" creates a sense of urgency.

   [Dung, Microsoft Word mangled some of the symbols in your message, so I
   might have guessed their plain-text counterparts incorrectly -- Ed.]


Jimmy Legs quotes the US Marine Corps dictionary:

   DI-DI (Viet.):  leave, go, move out.
   DI-DI MAU  (Viet.):  emphatic of Di-di.


>> Name Dropping

Tom Restivo:  Kristi Yamaguchi -- ladies figure skater who won the World
   Ladies Figure in 1991, and won the World title, US National title, and the
   Olympic Gold medal all in 1992.  She turned pro in 1993 and is now in
   skating tours and Pro Skating competitions.


Benjamin Robinson:  Jane Fonda was an actress who strongly opposed Vietnam
   War.  She propagandized for the North Vietnamese cause, and I think even
   visited them -- during the hostilities.  To this day, many Vietnam veterans
   have not forgiven her for this.


>> Hall of Presidents

Benjamin Robinson writes:  William Taft was President from 1908 to 1912, and
   later served on the Supreme Court.  His term was marked by in-fighting
   among Republicans. That allowed Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat and the next man
   on the wall, to succeed him.  Warren Harding, the third man shown,
   succeeded Wilson in 1920.  Notice that the pictures were hung in order;
   presumably Theodore Roosevelt would be to the left of Taft, and Calvin
   Coolidge to the right of Harding.  Hey, wow!  School can be educational!


Haynes Lee adds:  This is the first reference to Harding, whom had he not died
   in office would have been impeached.


>> Fun with promotions

Mike Reed transcribes the promo for this show:

   Announcer: Springfield gets snowed in!
   Homer: One snow angel comin' up!  Oh, why does that always happen?
   Announcer: But the kids are trapped in school, and they're taking over!
   Bart: We're in charge now!
   Skinner: This is a gross misuse of school property.  Where are the dodge
   balls?
   (Skinner writes on the board)


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this episode is:  Don't Eat Yellow Snow


According to Fox (by way of Bill LaRue), this episode scored a Nielsen rating
   of 8.7 (13 share).  This works out to 15.9 million viewers.  Among adults
   aged 18 to 49, the rating was 7.4 (18 share).


Don Del Grande:  At first, I thought "how did Skinner get 'the real Skinner's"
   uniform, and isn't it amazing how fell it fits" -- but then I remembered
   Skinner really was a Sergeant when he re-enlisted in the 100th episode.


Haynes Lee:  Salt melts ice by lowering its melting point.  And highly
   corrosive to boot.

% Are you ready for some football?  Homer sure is, and starts the day
% by watching Al, Jerry, and an unnamed third man on the pre-game
% show.

Al:		Pigskin Preview:  Denver-Green Bay -- Who do you 
		like?
Jerry:		That's football, right?  [the trio laughs] Well, I'm 
		going to take the Broncos in this game, because the 
		Packers will be blinded by Jerry's tie.  [more 
		laughter]
Homer:		Heh-heh-heh.  Tremendous
Al:		I'm more worried about Al's jacket.  [it is indeed a 
		loud jacket, with a checkerboard pattern] How many 
		stations can you get on that thing?
Wardrobe Mgr.:	[walks into camera view] All right, listen.  I am 
		sick of your jokes about the wardrobe.  You people 
		can dress yourselves!  [walks away]
Third Man:	[ahem] Well, folks, he's got a point, um, with all 
		our unscripted horseplay, we sometimes don't think 
		about ...
Homer:		[on the phone] Lenny!  Are you watching this?
Lenny:		[on the phone] Yeah, they really hurt that guy's 
		feelings.
Homer:		I know!
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% The Pigskin Preview is cut short when Marge and Lisa walk in.

Marge:	Ready for the circus, Homer?
Homer:	Circus?
	[words in <angle brackets> should be read in heavy French 
	accent]
Lisa:	<Le Cirque de Pureé.>  We've had tickets since 
	<Septembre>.
Homer:	But I want to watch Brett <Favre>.
Marge:	Come on, Homer.  They're only in town for eight months -- 
	then they're gone.
	[on TV, the Pigskin Preview guys laugh it up again]
Homer:	Oh, I missed one of Jerry's zingers!  Now I'll never catch 
	up.
-- It's like missing your favorite soap opera, "Skinner's Sense
   of Snow"

% Homer exchanges his "TV Sports" pennant for one reading, "French
% Circus" -- and that's where the family goes.

Marge:	Finally, a circus full of whimsy and wonder.
Homer:	Oh, yeah, that's way better than fun and excitement.
Lisa:	[reading from a pamphlet] As French-Canadians, they don't 
	believe in refunds or exploiting animals for 
	entertainment.
Homer:	Oh, I wanted to seem them fire a gorilla out of a cannon.
-- That's on "Pigskin Preview," actually, "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% The family takes their seats near ringside.  An usher bids the
% family to enjoy the show, "for one day, we shall die."
%
% The show itself is less grave.  Acrobats perform to colored lights
% and whimsical music.  Suddenly, a clown with a pushcart interrupts
% the show.

Clown:	Wait, wait!  <Attendéz!>  I cannot get the lid of my jar 
	of rainbows.  Who will help me?  [points to a man in a 
	double-breasted suit] You, sir!
Man:	[heavy French-Canadian accent] But I cannot help you, I am 
	just a local merchant from ... this town.
Homer:	[yelling from the audience] Just smash it open!
Clown:	Oh, you can do it if your heart is pure -- or purée.
	[audience laughs]
	[the man opens the jar, and rainbow-colored light appears 
	to spill from it.  The man, who is suspended on wires, is 
	lifted up and "flies" around the tent as more whimsical 
	music plays]
Marge:	They always pick the guy with the wires.
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Later, Marge watches the female acrobats perform difficult
% contortionist tricks.  The exotic positions give her ideas ... on
% how to clean the bathroom.  Other acrobats, dressed in gray
% leotards, form an elephant which rears up on its hind "legs."  Marge
% declares the circus "hauntingly beautiful."  Not from Homer's
% vantage point, it isn't.  A juggler wearing very tight pants has his
% personal region right in Homer's face.
%
% Suddenly, the wind kicks up and peels back a roof panel from the
% tent.

Sideshow Mel:	A storm is coming!  I can feel it in my bone.
Ringmaster:	Mesdames and Messieurs, it appears the cloud goddess 
		is ripe with rain babies.  We must run for our 
		trucks.
		[the audience runs for the exits]
Homer:		Oh, no, you don't!  I paid full price for this freak 
		show.  Now, nourish the child within me.  
		[threateningly, with raised fist] Nourish!
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% But the tent blows away, precluding further argument.  Some of the
% acrobats form a kite to ride away on the wind, but they get blown
% into a tree instead.
%
% The radio weatherman says the storm comes from a classic nor'easter
% meeting a classic "southwester."  The rain is predicted to turn to
% snow, so Bart is hopeful school will be cancelled.  Lisa notices the
% Sea Captain is hunkered down, but in reality he was tied up by rowdy
% teenagers.
%
% The next day, Bart and Lisa listen to radio, hoping for a school
% closure.

Announcer:	The following schools are closed today:  
		Shelbyville, Ogdenville, Ogdenville Tech, and 
		Springfield Elementary ... [Bart gasps] My Dear 
		Watson Detective School
Bart:		[groans]
Announcer:	And lastly, Springfield Elementary School ...
Bart + Lisa:	Yay!
Announcer:	... is open.
Bart + Lisa:	[groan]
Announcer:	And it's open season on savings at Springfield 
		Menswear ... which is closed.
Bart:		Oh, everyone's off but us.
Marge:		Oh, stop.  Your father and I don't get the day off.
Homer:		[runs by the kitchen doorway] Lenny says we got the 
		day off!  Yippee!  [runs outside]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Homer runs out to make a snow angel.  He's disappointed when it once
% again becomes a snow devil, with pitchfork and horns.
%
% His disappointment pales next to the kids, who have to endure a
% wildly out-of-control bus ride on Springfield's icy streets.  To
% Bart, it looks like everyone in the world has a snow day but the
% students.  The luckier townspeople frolic in the park.  Wiggum
% writes his name in the snow, apparently using the time-honored
% method employed by men and boys everywhere.  He asks Lou to "shake
% out the last few drops," and Lou does so -- as we learn that Wiggum
% was really "writing" with a thermos full of coffee.
%
% The student population is sparse enough that day for Skinner to
% consolidate them into one room.  The principal addresses his captive
% audience.

Skinner:	Children, I'm proud of you.  Most of our students 
		didn't bother to show up on this last day before 
		Christmas Break, but you've kept intact my Cal 
		Ripken-like streak of school openage.
Milhouse:	Hey, where are the teachers?
Skinner:	Eh, their union has called an emergency caucus.
		[cut to a ski lodge, where the teachers form a conga 
		line]
Teachers:	[conga rhythm] Caucus, caucus, caucus!  Caucus, 
		caucus, caucus!
Skinner:	But we'll have the last laugh on those Johnny-come-
		notlies.  We're going to watch my favorite movie 
		about a grinchy little character who tries to steal 
		Christmas.
		[pulls down a projector screen]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Don't get your hopes up, kids.  Skinner's talking about, "The
% Christmas That Almost Wasn't But Then Was," a black-and-white film
% from the 30s.  It starts out with Santa Claus consulting with what's
% obviously a stuffed reindeer.

Santa:		Ho, ho, ho!  What's that, Blitzen?  Why, yes, it is 
		Christmas Eve.
Elf:		I'm happy.
		[three little people wearing fake-y make-up burst 
		through the front door]
		[gasps] It's the Christmas hobgoblins!
		[the hobgoblins run in and start knocking things 
		over]
Nelson:		Hey, what the hell is this?
Skinner:	[laughs] It's classic mirth-making, is what it is.
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% The movie drags on.  A Christmas hobgoblin serenades Little Bo Peep.

Hobgoblin:	[singing]
		I will always love you,
		I will always be true,
		Spend my days pitching woo,
		                to you.
Milhouse:	Oh, he's been singing for two hours.
Lisa:		This couldn't have less to do with Christmas.  And I 
		think that's a stagehand.
		[in the movie, a man walks on set, and then quickly 
		backs off]
Bo Peep:	And I love you, too.
		And you and you and you,
		Oh, you and me,
		Together we can see ...
		[the film breaks, thankfully]
Nelson:		Ha-ha!  Next time, get a DVD.
Skinner:	This *is* a DVD.
		[ejects a flaming DVD from the projector, and stamps 
		it out]
-- Interesting bonus feature, "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Well, it's close to the usual dismissal time, so Skinner decides to
% run out the last few seconds on the clock.  The kids cheer when the
% dismissal bell rings.

Take off, and have a frank and productive holiday!
-- Principal Skinner, "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% The kids run out of the classroom, but don't get far.  The school is
% snowed in, with the snow literally piled up higher than the first
% floor.  All the exits are blocked.

Nelson:		We're trapped in the school!
		[kids scream]
Milhouse:	We're gonna miss Christmas!
		[kids scream louder]
Skinner:	I fixed the DVD!
		[loudest scream of all]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% [End of Act One.  Time: 6:59]
%
% Kent Brockman reports on the big snowstorm, which has recently been
% upgraded to a Class III Kill Storm.

Brockman:	And where are the city's snowplows?  Sold off to 
		billionaire Montgomery Burns in a veritable orgasm 
		of poor planning.
		[cut a room on Burns's manor, where he and Smithers 
		use two of the plows and a giant rubber ball to play 
		snowplow polo]
		[Burns scores a goal]
Burns:		He shoots, he scores!
Smithers:	Perfect form, sir.
		[cut back to the Simpsons' living room]
Marge:		This is terrible!  How will the kids get home?
Homer:		I dunno.  Internet?
-- Only if you have broadband, "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% The storm has brought the phone lines down, so it looks like Skinner
% and the kids are stuck at the school.  The students lament their
% lost plans, but Skinner is unsympathetic.

Nelson:		I can cut a trail through this snow.  I'm part 
		Eskimo.
Skinner:	I don't care if you're Kristi Yamaguchi.  No one 
		leaves the building.
Bart:		This stinks!  We'll miss the "Itchy & Scratchy" 
		where they finally kiss.
Skinner:	I don't care if they're kissing Kristi Yamaguchi -- 
		you're not going home.
Sherri:		That's so unfair.
Nelson:		This blows.
Milhouse:	Skinner's the real Grinch!
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Homer and Flanders plan to rescue the children from the snowbound
% school.  The two men sit in Ned's Geo, with a section of house roof
% attached to the front serving as a plow blade.

	[Homer starts the car]
Ned:	Well, I'm all for rescuing the kids, but I wish you hadn't 
	sawed off my roof.
Homer:	My car, your roof; it's only fair.
Ned:	But it's my car.
Homer:	Well, yeah.
Ned:	Hey, whatever happened to the plow from your old snowplow 
	business?
Homer:	I never had a snowplow business.
Ned:	Sure you did -- Mr. Plow.  You're wearing the jacket right 
	now.
Homer:	I think I know my own life, Ned.  [singing] Call Mr. Plow, 
	that's my name; that name again is Mr. Plow.  [drives out 
	of Flanders's driveway, knocking down his mailbox as he 
	goes]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Back at the school, the children begin to chafe at Mr. Skinner's
% restrictions, which include food rationing.  Nelson tries to make a
% break for it on his bike, but he bounces off the snowdrift that has
% piled up at the outside cafeteria door.  (The bike continues
% bouncing around the cafeteria.)  The failed attempt doesn't
% discourage the students, who repeatedly chant, "We want out!"

Skinner:	It's getting ugly out there.  Think, Skinner, think!  
		What would Superintendent Chalmers do?
		[Chalmers appears in a thought bubble]
Chalmers:	[accusingly] Skinner!
		[the thought bubble disappears]
Skinner:	Mmmm -- that's no help.  [notices he's sitting on a 
		military footlocker with his name stenciled on it]
		Ah, my old footlocker.  Back in 'Nam I could command 
		respect.
		[cut to a Vietnamese POW camp.  Skinner and two 
		other men share a cell]
Soldier 1:	Sarge, let's make a break for it while the guards 
		are partying with Jane Fonda.
Skinner:	Nope.  Too dangerous.  We're all going to sit tight 
		and reminisce about candy bars.
Soldier 2:	Uh, well, uh, one time, I'm eating a candy bar at 
		the beach, and a girl starts taking off her bathing 
		suit.
Skinner:	Get back to the candy bar.
Soldier 1:	Eh, the hell with this.  I'm getting out of here.
		[removes a board from the cell wall, and squeezes 
		through]
Skinner:	No!  You fool!
		[an elephant captures and eats the soldier]
		[cut back to the present]
		That elephant ate my entire platoon.
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Skinner vows not to let such an unfortunate thing happen again.  The
% next thing we know, he appears at the cafeteria entry wearing his
% Vietnam-era uniform, and really lays down the law:  no talking out
% of turn, and no leaving the room.

Nelson:		This sucks.
Skinner:	Are you questioning my authority?  Willie!
		[Willie comes over and hangs Nelson, by the vest, on 
		a coat hook]
Nelson:		Ow!  Mmmph -- my vest.  Well, don't just stand there 
		-- fight back!  There aren't enough coat hooks to 
		fit all of us.
Skinner:	Actually, there are.  [counts] Five ... ten ... 
		fifteen ... twenty.  [to Sherri and Terri] Eh, can 
		you two share a hook?
Sherri +
   Terri:	Yes, sir.
Skinner:	We're fine, then.
Nelson:		[groans]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Homer and Flanders slowly make their way to the school, careening
% off snowbanks as they go.

Ned:	I think we hit something.
Homer:	I hope it's Flanders!  [laughs, then notices Ned glaring 
	at him] I'm just kidding.  Hey, you're all right.  
	[playfully punches Flanders on the arm]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Meanwhile, it's lights-out for the children.  Skinner sets a bucket
% by Bart's head in case any of the students need to "answer nature's
% call" during the night.
%
% Bart decides to find a way out of the school, but Lisa encourages
% him to stay.  For all they know, she reasons, rescuers are digging
% them out right now.  She's partially right; it's wolves, not rescue
% workers, doing the digging.
%
% Back in the Geo, Homer sings along as "Feel Like Makin' Love" plays
% on the radio.  Homer claims to have written the song as a tribute to
% Princess Di and her boyfriend Dodi.  His tall tale ends when the car
% smashes into a fire hydrant.  Water spraying from the hydrant
% quickly encases the car in a block of thick ice.  The men are
% trapped as surely as the children they were trying to rescue.
%
% At the school, Bart tries to dig his way out with a ladle. 
% Meanwhile, Ralph approaches Skinner's cot.

Ralph:		Mr. Army Man?  I can't sleep without my Reggie 
		Rabbit.
Skinner:	Is that some sort of plush novelty?
Ralph:		Yes, ma'am.
Skinner:	Well, here's a scouring pad; it's just as good.
Ralph:		[caressing the pad to his cheek] It's cold and 
		hurty.
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Before Skinner falls back asleep, he notices snow coming out of a
% delivery chute in the wall.  When he investigates, he sees that Bart
% is digging a tunnel.  Blowing a whistle, which rouses the other
% students, he tells Bart to stop.

Skinner:	I know it looks like the path to freedom, but one 
		collapse and -- presto! -- you've got a snow casket.
Bart:		I was gonna put buttresses in.
Skinner:	Gonna, wounna, shounna.  Willie, destroy it.
		[as the students protest, Willie inspects the 
		tunnel]
Willie:		He did do a bonnie job, sir.
Skinner:	Defying orders, eh?  Well, I see you Scotsmen are 
		thrifty with courage, too.
Willie:		Okay, Skinner, that's the last time you'll slap your 
		Willie around.  I quit!
Skinner:	Fine.  I'll do the job myself.  [pokes the roof with 
		a broom, which begins to crumble] Help!  It's caving 
		in!
		[the roof caves in on Skinner, leaving only his head 
		exposed.
Bart:		What's the problem, Seymour?  Stuck?
Skinner:	That's precisely the problem, and you know it.  Now 
		get me out of here!
Bart:		What's that?  You want the pee bucket on your head?  
		[mounts the bucket there]
Skinner:	No!  You're twisting my words.
		[the students cheer]
Bart:		C'mon!  We're taking over the school!
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:21]
%
% The kids have extracted Skinner from the collapsed snow tunnel, and
% stuffed him in a burlap dodge-ball sack, cinching the opening tight
% around his neck, so that only his head sticks out.  With Skinner's
% "reign of fussiness" over, the school is under kid control.  They
% take advantage the way you'd expect them to.  Nelson uses a debating
% team trophy to dole out pickle relish to the hungry students. 
% Richard and Lewis race down the hall in a pair of janitor's buckets. 
% Milhouse draws mustaches on the Presidential portraits, but is
% stymied by a picture of the mustachioed President Taft.  As the
% piece de resistance, someone has put a gag on Skinner.
%
% Homer and Flanders assess their situation.

Homer:	Oh, stupid ice!  I always knew I'd die caked in something.
Ned:	Well, better turn off that engine before those fumes put 
	us in tombs.
Homer:	Wait, let's just leave it on 'til we forget our troubles.
Ned:	[getting sleepy] Sounds like a plan.
	[Homer and Ned pass out]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Bart makes Skinner write "I ain't not a dorkus" repeatedly on the
% blackboard.

Skinner:	I can't write this; it's a grammatical nightmare.
Bart:		[pokes him with a ruler] Mau!  Di-di mau!
Skinner:	I'm getting a cramp in my wrist.
Bart:		Oh, boo-hoo.  After all the times I've done it, my 
		wrist sounds like a cement mixer.  [demonstrates]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Later, Bart makes Skinner try to climb a gym rope while still in the
% sack.  Nelson whips him every now and then with a towel.  Skinner
% protests that this is impossible, but gains no relief from Bart. 
% "What part of 'di-di mau' don't you understand," the boy asks.
%
% After that, Skinner watches helplessly as the students make a mess
% of his office.

Milhouse:	Hey, I got Skinner's key card!  We can finally see 
		our permanent records.
Skinner:	No, you can't go in there.
		[he does anyway.  The kids cheer and begin reading 
		through their files]
Bart:		[reading his file] "Underachiever and proud of it."  
		How old is this thing?
Lisa:		[reading her file] "Lisa is an outstanding student 
		with a slight tendency towards know-it-all-ism."  
		[gasps] That's not even a word.
Milhouse:	Then we'll get rid of the record -- permanently.  
		[Milhouse tears the page out of Lisa's file and rips 
		it up.  The page re-assembles and attaches itself to 
		the binder containing Lisa's record.  Then the 
		binder jumps back in the record file with the other 
		binders, and the file cabinet closes]
-- Not much need for keeping backups, "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Nelson pulls Skinner's personnel file.

Nelson:		Hey, look how much money Skinner makes.  $25,000 a 
		year!
		[the students say, "wow"]
Bart:		[putting the numbers in a calculator] Let's see, 
		he's 40 years old times 25 grand -- whoa, he's a 
		millionaire.
		[the students sound impressed]
Skinner:	I wasn't a principal when I was 1!
Nelson:		Plus, in the summer, he paints houses.
Milhouse:	He's a billionaire!
		[the students say "wow" again]
Skinner:	If I were a billionaire, why would I be living with 
		my mother?  [the students laugh at him]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Skinner thinks of Nibbles, the school hamster, and sees a way out of
% the mess he's in.  He sneaks into the classroom where Nibbles's cage
% is kept, and writes an SOS note.  He places the note and the hamster
% in a hamster ball, and carefully places them on top of the snow by
% the window.  Nibbles scoots a few yards away from the school, then
% falls through the snow.  Skinner curses his luck as Nelson finds
% him.

Skinner:	Nelson, if you get me out of this, there's a hall 
		monitor position coming open in the spring.
Nelson:		I spit on your monitors.
Skinner:	I know.  That's why the position's available.
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Meanwhile, Homer and Ned are still subdued by the fumes in
% Flanders's car.  Homer dreams that he is a sultan surrounded by
% dancing girls.

Homer:	Enough!  I grow weary of your sexually suggestive dancing.  
	Bring me my ranch dressing hose.  [claps twice]
	[the dancing girls bring a fire hose, which shoots ranch 
	dressing into Homer's open mouth.  A camel that nudges 
	Homer]
Camel:	[speaking with Flanders's voice] Homer, Homer.
	[back to reality]
Ned:	Homer, wake up!  The car's filling with ...
Homer:	I know -- ranch dressing.
	[Nibbles, still in his exercise ball, crashes through the 
	windshield]
	A hamster ball!
Ned:	Just like the one that saved Ezekiel!  [the men breathe 
	fresh air through the hole in the windshield]
Homer:	We're free -- and we got something to eat!
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% The ice around the car begins to melt, freeing the two Homer and
% Ned.  They head out for the school.  Homer notices that the Geo has
% cruise control.  "School, please," he asks, as he takes his hands
% off the wheel.  The car immediately begins to spin out of control,
% towards the cracker factory.
%
% Back at the school, the kids have started burning books in the
% library.

Bart:		So long, Johnny Tremaine.  Your Newberry award won't 
		save you now.  [chucks the book into the fire]
Skinner:	Not "Huck Finn!"  I spent hours crossing out the 
		sass-back!
-- No respect for good censorship, "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Flanders's car heads toward some silos at the factory.

Ned:	We're going to crash!
Homer:	Do you have airbags?
Ned:	No.  The Church opposes them for some reason.
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% The car hits a silo containing cracker salt.  It tips over, and
% slides down a hill, conveniently landing at the doorstep of
% Springfield Elementary.  The salt melts the snow surrounding the
% school, allowing access to the front door.  The students hear the
% ruckus and realize that they are now free.  They run out the door in
% time to meet Homer and Ned, who pull up (a little worse for the
% wear) in the Geo.  The salt immediately rusts out the car.
%
% Nibbles, still in the exercise ball, rolls out of the car to
% Skinner.

You did it, Nibbles.  Now, chew through my ball sack.
-- Principal Skinner, "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Superintendent Chalmers arrives via snowmobile.

Chalmers:	Skinner!
Skinner:	Superintendent Chalmers.
Chalmers:	What are you doing in that ridiculous duffel, 
		Seymour?  And is that burning literature I smell?
Skinner:	Uh, well, sir ... I, uh ...
Chalmers:	There'd better be a good explanation for this.
Bart:		There is, sir.
Chalmers:	Ah.  Then I'm happy.  [rides off]
-- "Skinner's Sense of Snow"

% Bart and Skinner agree that this is one of those situations that 
% don't need to be discussed ever again.

Homer:	Come on, kids.  Let's leave this awful place and never 
	come back.
	[Homer, Ned, Bart, and Lisa get in the car, and drive 
	away]
Bart:	Boy, that salt really ate through the car.
Lisa:	And the exhaust pipe is leaking.
Homer:	Whuh?
Lisa:	And furthermore ... [metamorphs into a camel-headed 
	creature] Hooonk!
Bart:	[as a dancing girl] Ignore her, effendi.  We have each

Homer:	Oooh, baby.  [cut to exterior shot of the car]
Bart:	Yaaah!  [the car begins to swerve around the road]
Homer:	It's no use struggling, my beloved chalamala.
