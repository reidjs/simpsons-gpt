   [If you use these summarise to determine if you have found the right
   capsule, here's a TV Guide-like synopsis: For the first time in his life,
   Apu becomes quite popular with the ladies of Springfield. He's having the
   time of his life until his mother makes a visit from India, reminding him
   of his arranged marriage, which will take place soon unless Homer can do
   something about it.]

==============================================================================
Blackboard:     None.

Couch:          Bart spraypaints a picture of his family on the couch, leaving
                his alias signature, `El Barto.'

==============================================================================
> Didja notice...
==============================================================================
   ... the Springfield Civic Center looks much smaller on the outside?
   ... Apu is sat with Sanjay at the auction?
   ... Krusty presents the auction, his attire being his robe?
   ... Stacey Lavelle at the auction?
   ... when the ladies are making impressed noises about Apu's accomplishments
       in computers, among them is a guy?
   ... some peacocks can be seen during Apu's flashback?
   ... after several different possible new hairstyles, Apu keeps his old
       style?
   ... the Retirement Castle still has a sattelite dish?
   ... how fast Homer learns everyone's names at the old folks home?
   ... Moe wears an Easter Island t-shirt?

Donni Saphire-Bernstein:
   ... the old guy Homer took the place of looked kind of self-sufficient?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Miss Hoover lives next to Milhouse?
   ... Luann Van Houten has an income, since she (supposedly) pays alimony
       to Kirk?
   ... Tuesday is Ladies' Night at Moe's, despite the fact that women
       still don't go there (according to 4F03)?
   ... Selma and Miss Hoover were among the bidders for Apu, but Patty and
       Mrs. Krabappel were not?
   ... Springfield's regular fire department doesn't have a fire engine,
       but the volunteer FD does?
   ... when Apu "comes home" to Marge, they shake hands?
   ... Milhouse and Sanjay's daughter are throwing rocks at Homer when
       he's trapped in the tree?
   ... Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel are dancing together at the
       wedding?
   ... the "normal" credits started to run, but after Yeardley Smith's
       name appeared, it switched to the "compressed" credits?

Tony Hill:
   ... Homer expects Apu's mother to write Apu a dirty letter?

   ... Miss Hoover is wearing makeup on her date with Apu?
   ... the crazy old man has a wheelchair?

Dallas Pesola:
   ... the Springfield Retirement Castle has a satellite dish on the roof?
       I was suprised that the writers didn't add 'satellite TV' as one of
       the reasons Homer loved it there.

Jeremy Reaban:
   ... the Beer Tap in Moes has a label on it "Booze"?
   ... Smithers was in the audience at the bachelor auction?
   ... as the everyone dances at the party at the end, Homer continues to be
       manhandled by the elephant?
   ... he eventually comes to enjoy it ("Hey, everybody's upside down")?
   ... at the end, Seymor and Mrs. Krabapple are dancing together?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... the Yodel box is consistently shown in the same position, even when
       Homer isn't sing it?  Now <that's> attention to detail!

Bob Wells:
   ... that Apu's mother (or whoever was planning this wedding) could come
       up with an elephant and an Indian band, but Rev. Lovejoy had to fill
       in for a Hindu clergyman?

       [{lc} comments, "You miss the point.  The point is to make a joke.
       A Hindu priest performing a Hindu ceremony is not funny in itself.
       A Christian minister performing a Hindu wedding is, because of the
       incongruity.  This makes it funny.  (I admit the joke didn't come off
       very well because Rev. Lovejoy's lines were not very funny.)  But one
       of the basic principles of all sitcom writing is putting in things
       that defy logic so you can set up a joke.  For instance, also in this
       episode, Lisa asks what the red dot on the old Indian woman's forehead
       means.  Some people have said that Lisa, being so intelligent, should
       already have known.  Fine - but then how do you set up a joke about
       it?  If Bart asks, and Lisa tells him, where's the humor?" --hmw]

Buchanun (buchanon-aol.com):
   ... Apu  sleeps in Bart's Krusty sleeping bag?
   ... the Kwik-E-Mart doesn't accept checks, credit cards, or food stamps?
   ... Moe has been planing a trip to Easter Island for years?
   ... Moe doesn't know Easter Island has giant heads?
   ... Moe bought a t-shirt at Easter Island?
   ... Homer's room number at the RC is 6B?
   ... Krusty needs a teleprompter to say "hey hey"?

==============================================================================
* In 9F01, Springfield has a fire engine, so why would they need to have a
  bachelor auction to raise funds to get one?

* Let's just say the Krusty learned how to read a teleprompter after "Krusty
  Gets Busted (7G)" and leave it at that, okay? {bjr}

c Close captioning at auction has words for "My Guy" but the only music is
  heard. {hl}

c Captain McAllister says "I'm not attractive" but [please don't say what I
  think you're going to say, Haynes.. --hmw] close captioning says "I'll go
  quietly". [phew. --hmw] {hl}

= Why was Professor Frink in the bachelor auction?  He's married. {nmd}

  [BiffFoil (bifffoil@aol.com) suggests, "Do you remember the episode (don't
  remember which, sorry) in which Frink shows a demonstration of his young
  son flying a plane, then accidentally sends his son crashing through the
  window??  I'd say that might be something that would cause a divorce, don't
  you?" --hmw]

= Apu doesn't have anyone sat next to him on either side, unlike in earlier
  shots.

* How did the "five desparate chicks" gather so quickly?

= The card and envelope Apu had vanishes.

= When Apu climbs onto the Kwik-E-Mart table, the squishee cup has
  disappeared.

* Doesn't Homer normally carry around lots of money?  (8F11 and 3F16 come to
  mind.)  He should be able to easily afford a candy bar and a lottery
  ticket, especially a $500 one. {ddg}

= The lottery tickets "magically" disappear.

= Homer's yodel isn't in Homer's hand as he leaves the Kwik-E-Mart.

* How did Homer know the time while in the Retirement Castle? There isn't a
  clock, and he isn't wearing a watch.

* Homer greets a guy named Asa in the retirement home-- This can't possibly
  be Asa Phelps, since he died in the "Flying Hellfish" episode. {ji} [but Asa
  Phelps is only one of the many Asa's it could be. --hmw]

* Homer already knows what a wheelchair is; in 2F06, he wanted Marge to sit in
  a hallowed-out wheelchair. {ddg}  [All the time he spends in the power plant
  is taking it's toll, no doubt. --hmw]

= The wheels on Homer's chair got bigger once he was seated. {th}

c Apu says, "1 in 25 arranged marriages end in divorce," but the captions
  say "1 in 85...". {ji}

= OFF's garden seems to have expanded for the wedding.

= Although Luann Van Houten bids on and wins Apu , she's seen at the wedding
  with her normal boyfriend, the American Gladiator (forget his name). {jr}

* Didn't Apu live in a house in "Two Bad Neighbors"? {nmd} [In theory, he did,
  but we only saw him stood outside a house washing his car. --hmw]

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  On the one hand, I couldn't help but laugh at the
   contribution of the cast members: Hank Azaria is so funny as Apu that his
   just being irritated in that voice sends me into hysterics.  I also enjoyed
   Homer's visit to the nursing home.  Unfortunately, the plot as a whole (or
   is that "hole"?) was too outlandish in the first place to be redeemed by
   good performances or gags.  Not the worst of the season (not by a long
   shot), but a disappointment nonetheless. (C+)

Ben Collins:  My hopes after 4F23 were a little off base: 5F04 is, "without a
   doubt," as the CBG would say, the worst episode this season. Everything
   from the stupid premise to the tired, sitcom-standard gags were
   excrutiatingly unfunny and painful to watch; I probably cracked a tiny
   smile once. And, once again, Homer's antics were much more grating than
   they could ever be amusing. Fortunately, this has been Richard Appel's only
   real clunker; let's hope he hasn't totally lost it. (D)

Chris Courtois:  As secondary character episodes go, "The Two Mrs.
   Nahasapeemapetilons" was one of the better ones. OFF still played a role in
   the episode, and we weren't subjected to previously unsuspected revelations
   about the character. Apu had a fully in-character star turn, Homer was just
   Stupid Homer and not the dread A-incarnation we've gotten in most of the
   5F's to date, and Lisa behaved (*gasp*) like an eight year old girl, not a
   mouthpiece for political commentary. The middle part, with Marge posing
   as Apu's wife, was dumb typical sitcom farce. But the last act was pretty
   funny, with lowbrow humor (Homer impersonating Ganeesh, the elephant
   beating up Homer) and satire ("God bless America"[s high divorce rate],
   "Christ is Christ") blending smoothly. (B+)

Andrew Gill:  After a good Act 1, the show seemed to plummet.  I remember
   thinking "great! Asshole Homer in the background.  That works well."  Then
   Homer went to Springfield Retirement Castle.  EEUGH!  There was so much
   room for creativity that didn't get placed there. (C)

Tony Hill:  This was a fairly goofy episode.  It was pretty funny and an
   exception to my usual dictum that eps built around minor characters aren't
   very good.  Homer was even more boneheaded than usual.  I suppose we'll see
   Apu's wife written into more episodes in the future.  I give it a (B+).

Haynes Lee:  Had a good premise but the Marge and the kids posing as the family
   was far too contrived. I could have seen Apu shacking up with Patty & Selma
   instead. At least we did not get disappointed by another ruined wedding
   ceremony. (C-)

Ondre Lombard:  The set-up act is at best decent and at worst average, but
   that's the most upstanding part of the entire story.  This sequel to Homer
   and Apu imitates a sitcom far too much for my taste, and deals with Apu so
   much that the family is basically non-existant.  What's worse is that the
   part that is supposed to deal with the family (Marge pretending to be
   Apu's wife) lasts for a split second while we watch Homer act like a
   consistant 8th-season moron at the retirement home.  Each act seems to be
   a different story.  Act 1 is Apu's life as a swinging bachelor, Act 2 is
   Homer At the Retirement Home, with Marge living with Apu as a subplot,
   Act 3 is Apu's Wedding.  Too much veering off course, too much
   mischaracterization (particularly on Homer and Lisa), too much Apu, and
   too little comedy. (D -)

Michael K. Neylon:  Overall, this is a effort I would gladly forget.  Nothing
   really impressed me about it, and only founded my concerns about this
   season. For a latter season, it was terribly average (C, 6/10), and holds
   nothing to the series overall. (D-)

Damian Penny:  This was preferable to watching the Grey Cup blowout, but it
   was still a pretty mediocre episode.  The subplot about Homer moving in with
   his father was far more entertaining - that probably should have been the
   focus of the show!  There were aa few clever moments here and there
   (especially Lenny's "depressant" line), but not enough to save it. (C)

Mark Aaron Richey:  Only OFF would stage a sweeps staple-a wedding-and make it
   an arranged Hindu one.  For two acts, Apu's attempts to avoid his nuptiuals
   was very funny.  Only during the third act, when the real Mrs. Nahasapeema
   (...oh never mind) find out the truth did it  began to derail.  However,
   the wedding turned out to be the highlight of the show, with Homer's attack
   and Apu actually deciding to go through with the ceremony (a nice and
   somewhat unexpected development).  It shoud be interesting to see if Apu
   will stay married, but the weddin was just fine. (B+)

Benjamin Robinson:  This show aims to present an amusing take on an old
   comedic standard, and in the main is successful at it.  Unexpectedly light
   on "let's pretend we're married" scenes, "The Two Mrs. N's" concentrates
   instead on Homer's actions while the plan unfolds.  The end peters out a
   bit, but this is a fine episode overall.  Look -- or listen, rather -- for
   Andrea Martin and Jan Hooks, terrific as Apu's mom and bride, respectively.
   (B+)

Donni Saphire-Bernstein:  This episode was great. Despite some pain-inducing
   parts (i.e. Bart and Lisa questioning Apu's mom), it lived up to and
   exceeded my expectations. I'll admit some things bothered me- Homer as this
   creative mastermind sort of reminds me of Heathcliff, and how did they
   manage to get in all those Indian guests and not a hindu, err, spiritual
   leader? But it really was funny, and I think that those who criticize the
   lack of character depth and subtlety over the past season or so are missing
   the point. We're supposed to laugh, dammit! And I pretty much wet my pants
   when Homer came out as Ganeesh. Also providing the rolling-on-the-floors
   were Homer and Apu talking about faking deaths, Homer in the old folks home
   (finally a worthy subplot of sorts!) and the guys at the bar speculating
   about Apu. I might venture to say that this episode is the best so far this
   season, easily clearing Lisa's Sax and even (although I was the only one
   who liked it) Homer vs. New York. (A)

Mike (thisthat-mindspring.com):  Surprisingly well written episode about Apu
   as he tries to break a pre-arranged marriage.  Homer come up with the
   'terriffic' idea to have Apu pretend to be married to Marge when Apu's
   mother pays a visit to find out why he's already married in America.
   Needless to say, the plan is foiled when Apu's mom catches Homer and Marge
   in bed.  Push comes to shove and Apu gives in and marries his pre-arranged
   bride.  Highlights include Homer hiding out in the Nursing home, the
   actual ceremony (with Bart's 'traditional' kick and his longing for Stampy
   the elephant), and Homer getting attacked by the elephant at the end.  (B)

Doc Quack:  This show demonstrates the loss of the older sharp humor that was
   the reason we watched in the first place. Homer was dumber than dirt...
   Again. Marge was a non-objecting dishcloth... Again. The kids were
   around... somewhere.  It starts with a fire engine fund raiser, raffling
   off Springfield eligible bachelors, and rapidly goes downhill from there.   
   Apu is forced into putting himself up, and all of the women bid on him,
   with a consortium of desperate women getting him.  (Hey, this is the best
   part of the show!)  It rapidly goes downhill from there.  (C-)

Yours truly:  Not bad. Of course, there were flaws, but overall it was a
   fresh and funny episode. It's good to have an episode like this that
   doesn't only revolve around OFF, pulling in a less relevant but well-loved
   character like Apu into it. (B)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> The Educational Corner

Benjamin Robinson: I almost put these two items in the "Oops!" (known as
   `animation, continuity, and other goofs --hmw) section, but decided against
   it.  The "mistake" in both cases seemed to be a deliberate part of the
   joke.  Just to set the record straight, though:

   1) You can't hold a scratch-off ticket to the light and see whether or not
      it's a winner. Both the scratch-off material and the ticket paper itself
      are thick enough to block light.
   2) Contrary to popular belief, elephants aren't afraid of mice. They can be
      frightened of things they hear but can't see, however, which may be how
      the "elephant vs. mice" story got started.

   There -- now you know.


>> Well, it beats the bar scene

Benjamin Robinson: A few weeks ago, ABC news correspondent John Stossel had a
   special report revolving around love and marriage.  For the show, he
   interviewed several people who had their marriages arranged by their
   parents.  Unlike Apu, who was at best ambivalent about his nuptials, the
   interviewees all praised the arrangement.  Their parents, they noted, were
   in a good position to objectively decide whether two people would be a good
   match for one another.  One person pointed out that the Western notion of
   marrying for love was hardly foolproof -- witness the high rate of divorce.
   Stossel was quick to say that in many countries where arranged marriage is
   the norm, divorce was also a taboo.  Still, the argument for betrothal was
   stronger than I thought it would be.  Perhaps Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilon had
   the right idea, after all.


>> Next week, we'll have 'em in Chinese!

Benjamin Robinson: Another week, another closing credits policy.  Here's what
   we've seen so far:

   [4F22]  Split screen, with "open" part used for Homer's drive out of New
           York City.
   [4F23]  Split screen, with preview of next week's show.  (Which,
           ironically, was pre-empted for baseball.)
   [5F02]  Full screen to show "Halloween" credits
   [5F01]  Split screen, with preview, again
   [5F03]  Full screen, with Homer talking over the credits
   [5F04]  Full screen for the "core" family, split screen with previews for
           everyone else.  (Including Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer, who ought
           to be on the same "plane" as the rest of the regular cast.)

   Mike Smith adds, "3G02, in which they preview TOH VIII, on split screen."

   Dale G. Abersold's guess on the matter, "I think the reason for the
      unusual credits this week is the following: for 4F23 and 5F01, the
      credits went straight from the exec. producers to the Gracie Films
      screen and the 20th Century Fox logo (with annoying new "music").
      If you'll notice, however, just before the Gracie Films music plays, we
      hear the final chord of the closing theme, rather jarring.  The musical
      solution?  Play the very beginning of the opening theme, which segues
      into the final chord.  No more jarring."


>> Stooping low.

Nathan Mulac DeHoff: I found it interesting that Apu's mother mentions her
   "Brahmin heritage." Brahmins are the highest class in Hindu society (which
   makes it a little ironic that Apu works in a convenience store).  Since it
   is considered "dirty" for someone in India to eat food prepared by a lower
   class, the most famous Indian cooks tend to be Brahmins (at least from what
   I heard in my ninth grade World Cultures class), and note that Apu mentions
   that he likes to cook.


>> El Castrato!

Laura Canon: Castrati (eunuchs) are traditional at Hindu weddings.  Even today
   in India there remains a caste or class of eunuchs who roam around making
   their living solely by entertaining at weddings/parties.  I'm surprised the
   Simpsons knew about this, however, unless they read a book that was
   published a couple of months ago by an American woman on this very subject.
   I'm also surprised they used the term castrati - either they couldn't get
   eunuch by the censors or they thought people wouldn't know what eunuch
   meant.


>> Have a curry!

Dale G. Abersold: This episode was particularly appropriate for this fall as
   India is currently celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of independence
   from Great Britain.  Go have a curry!  Watch _Gandhi_!  Do _something_
   to celebrate the independence of the world's biggest democracy. [posted

>> Easter island? What kind of joke is that?

   Easter Island  (Rapa Nui, Chile) is over 2,000 miles from the nearest
   population center, (Tahiti and Chile), making it one of the most
   isolated places on Earth. A triangle of volcanic rock in the South
   Pacific - it is best known for the giant stone monoliths, known as
   Moai, that dot the coastline. The early settlers called the island "Te
   Pito O Te Henua" (Navel of The World). Admiral Roggeveen, who came
   upon the island on Easter Day in 1722, named it Easter Island. Today,
   the land, people and language are all referred to locally as Rapa Nui.
   There has been much controversy and confusion concerning the origins
   of the population of Easter Island. Thor Heyerdahl proposed that the
   people who built the statues were of Peruvian descent, due to a
   similarity between Rapa Nui and Incan stonework. Some have suggested
   that Easter Island is the remnant of a lost continent, or the result
   of an extra-terrestrial influence . Archaeological evidence, however,
   indicates discovery of the island by Polynesians at about 400 AD -
   led, according to legend, by Hotu Matua. Upon their arrival, an
   impressive and enigmatic culture began to develop. In addition to the
   statues, the islanders possessed the Rongorongo script; the only
   written language in Oceania. The island is also home to many
   petroglyphs (rock carvings), as well as traditional wood carvings,
   tapa (barkcloth) crafts, tattooing, string figures, music and dance.

>> What's with that dot?

Benjamin Robinson: (concerning Lisa's question about Apu's mother's gopi dot)
   Personally, I felt the scene would have played better if Lisa's line was
   just assigned to Bart:
  
   Lisa:  Excuse my asking, Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilan, but can you tell me what
          the significance of your forehead dot is?
   Bart:  Yeah, man, what's the deal with the dot?
  
   See, it's funny (in my opinion, at least) and it doesn't bend up logic too
   much.  I agree that characters in a comedy cannot act with perfect
   rationality, for if they did, you would have a drama.  Still, there are
   limits to how far one can push illogic.  If people act completely out of
   character, or make stupefyingly boneheaded decisions, it can throw the
   viewer for a loop and blunt the humor of the situation.


>> Do not offer my God a peanut!

Tim Mooken: Ganesha is chiefly worshiped as "the remover of obstacles" a boon
   that would be very helpful to Kwik-E-Mart owners, who have to contend with
   such "obstacles as high rent, punk kids, vermin infestation and or the Dept
   of Health, and of course taxes.  According to a myth Ganesha's father Siva
   mistook him as a lover of his wife and loped his head off.  But was then
   forced to replace it with the first living thing he saw.  Siva isn't very
   forgiving of Oedipus complexes.  As far as I know he has no particular
   connection with children.


>> Bupkes shmupkes

Haynes Lee: What Krusty said while trying to auction Barney ["bupkes" --hmw.]
   is Yiddish for zilch.


>> Fried Green Tomatoes

"Fried Green Tomatoes" is exactly what Manjula says -- a movie, a book, and
   of course, a food. The book (or at least the one I know of) is called
   "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe," written by Fannie Flagg.
   Flagg also wrote the 1991 "Fried Green Tomatoes" movie, directed by Jon
   Avnet. Rumour has it there's also a food known as fried green tomatoes, but
   it's unconfirmed.


>> What's with that dot?

The dot on Mother Nahasapeemapetilon's head is what is called a "gopi dot".
   Indian women have them on their forehead to show they are married. It's
   made of a removable red liquid.


- Musical references
   - At the bachelor auction, Barney was played on (and off) the stage by a
     symphonic version of "My Guy." [Performed by Mary Wells {hl} --hmw] {bjr}
   - Also, Moe strutted his stuff to the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive." {bjr}
   - "Hot Blooded," by Foreigner, accompanied Apu's wild ride through
     downtown.
     (Later, he despondently sang this tune in Moe's Tavern.) {bjr}
   - The band at the wedding played a translated version of the Carpenters' 
     "Close to You." {bjr}

>> Miscellaneous

- MPAA rating: PG-L {ddg}

- Maggie's falls: 1 (when Apu's mother mentions she's a grandmother) {ddg}

- The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Seymour Nahasapeemapetilons


>> Unanswered questions

Don Del Grande points out some of the oddities in the episode:

- Marcia Wallace got a credit; did she have a speaking role?  (Maybe it was
  cut?)

- Who was the "fifth woman" (besides Miss Hoover, Luann, Selma, and Ruth
  Powers)?

- What was with the first Easter Island joke?

Thank you, Hey-hey! I can't read that, not that either. O.K, let's bring on

bear. Say hello to Barney Gumble. (walks on) I got zero, zero, zero, I got
zero! [Barney walks to rejects]
-- Krusty, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

       have a discussion about where to put it in a room.
-- The exciting life of Apu, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

      Miss Hoover: Fifty dollars.

        that you were such a great shot.
   Apu: Oh yes, all Kwik-E-Mart managers must be skilled in the deadly arts.

-- One down, four to go, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

% Time has passed, and Apu is at the Kwik-E-Mart, reading a romantic letter
% from one of his many girlfriends.

       when I get you all alone.. Oh! It gets kinda personal here.
Homer: I see... [reads rest] Wow!
  Apu: Here's one from my mother.
Homer: Lets see what she wrote! [lusty growl]
-- "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

% Apu opens up the letter and a lotus flower drops out. It must be a bad
% sign, because Apu screams.

You don't like lotus flowers too? Don't get me started on lotus flowers.
-- Homer to Apu, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

% Apu explains that this lotus flower is an indication that his arranged
% marriage, which was arranged when Apu was only eight years old, has caught
% up with him and that the wedding will be soon. A flashback ensues.

    Apu's mother: 10 boats and a electric fan, you call that a dauree?
Manjula's mother: OK, we will throw in a textile factory as well. But only
                  because Manjula is getting on in years.
    Apu's mother: Ok it is agreed. Your 3rd daughter will marry our first
                  son.
Monjula's mother: It is done.
-- A life-changing conversation, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

% Back to present.

  Apu: I can't get married, I'm just beginning to enjoy my batchelorhood,
       what should I do?
Homer: Tell her the truth, you are not ready to get married!
  Apu: No, you don't know mother. She will never quit until I am married!
Homer: Then tell her you already got married!
  Apu: No, no, no I cannot lie to my mother.
Homer: Then get married. Phew! What do you want from me?
-- "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

% Later, Apu is on the telephone to his mother, explaining that he's
% already been married and the arranged marriage can't happen.

Yes that is right mother, I already got married. Why did I not bother to
tell you? The reason is... [looks at Homer who holds up sign: Where are

you [kiss kiss], bye bye. [puts phone down]. It worked! The lie has set
me free!

       and this lottery ticket. I have this much.

-- A yodel is worth 500 words, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

  Apu: [yawns]
Homer: Late night, eh?
  Apu: Not the type to kiss and tell sir, but listen to this.
       [whispers, then gasps at the sight of his mother strolling through
       the parking lot. The gasp is odd sounding, and impresses Homer.]
Homer: Oh you dog!
  Apu: Oh, It's my mother! What am I going to do?!
Homer: What's the problem?
  Apu: Don't you see?! She is here to meet my wife!
       [Homer looks blank]

Homer: It's you.
-- "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

Apu's mother: I have come to meet this wife of yours.
         Apu: And meet her you shall!
              [Homer winks and walks away]
              It is a very reasonable request that can be easily be granted
              in a timely and officient...
Apu's mother: Let's go.
         Apu: ... And we shall because it is in the timing that

-- Homer, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

Homer: [sees Apu pull up outside) Marge, I need a small favour! Over the

Marge: [gasps] What?
Homer: Please, it's just for as long as his mothers living here!

Woman: It's a machine that breaths for him.
Homer: And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. And how come everyone

Woman: Over there?

Lisa: You did, his name was Stampy, you loved him.
Bart: Oh yeah...
-- Continuity takes it's toll, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

% The elephant spots a mouse, and crushes it!
% Apu gets down from the elephant and meets Manjula for the first time in
% many years. Homer breaks into the wedding trying to put it on hold!

 Homer: I am the God, Genesh! This wedding angers me. It will break up or all
        will die.
   Apu: Oh God!
 Homer: Please Listen to me! 
Indian: Tu begin Ganesh. Ganesh by undercan deay ne!
        ["You are not Ganesh. Ganesh is graceful"] [chases after Homer]
 Homer: [runs off and loses an arm] Stop chasing Ganesh, you're just going to
        get more Wrath!
-- Homer tries to stop Apu's wedding, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

    Apu: Oh, this is all my fault. To be perfectly true to you I have not been
         exactly looking forward to this arranged marriage. 
Manjula: Nor have I, marrying a complete stranger, it is crazy!
-- "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

Everyone, Ganesh has been subdued [shot of him in tree] Resume the ceremony!
-- Apu's mother, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

    Apu: Quickly tell me, what is your favourite movie, book, and food?
Manjula: The answer to all three is Fried Green Tomatoes.
-- "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

    Apu: Do you think this marriage will work?
Monjula: I don't know, we can always get a divorce.
-- Planning ahead, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

% The soon to be wedded couple walk around the fire hand in hand and to the
% front. Reverend Lovejoy marries them.

[crying] Geez, I am no good at weddings!
-- Moe, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

% The band plays "Close to You" by The Carpenters, Indian style.

 Lisa: Dad, those peanuts aren't for you, they're for the elephant!
Homer: They are?
       [Elephant grabs him with it's trunk.]
       Aghh, put me down! Ganesh commands you!
-- Elephant to elephant, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

    Apu: Well, so far so good, don't you think? I can't wait to show you my
         appartment.
Manjula: Apartment?! No No, you must buy me a house. And you are getting a
         haircut.
    Apu: [shocked, worried] Oh!
Manjula: Got you!
         [Both laugh]
-- Cruel humor, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"

Stop, come on elephant! Whee, everyone is upside down! [laughs]
-- Homer, "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"
