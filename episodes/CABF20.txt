Couch:          A football bounces into view, followed by all five Simpsons,
                wearing uniforms.  One by one, they all jump on it.  Maggie
                pops out of the pile with the ball.  She spikes it and does a
                little victory dance.  [Recycled from CABF06]

Don Del Grande:
   ... there was only one column of blackboard quotes?
   ... there was additional blank space between each quote?
   ... Bart drinks Mountain Dew (and it's not "Code Red") for breakfast?
   ... in Homer's story, Lisa tells Bart he'll get to China if he keeps
       digging, something the real Lisa would know isn't true?
   ... the dartboard score said "J I" and "G XII"?
   ... in Moe's, Homer serves Duff in bottles rather than from the tap?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the Simpsons now have their own "electric heart starter" machine
       (forgot the actual name of it)?  [Defibrillator -- Ed.]
   ... Moe thinks that it's the 20th Century?

Chad Lehman:
   ... the painting of Swigmore U. looks like Springfield U. from [BABF06]?
       (the battlement and towers are identical; the intro music is the same
       when Moe enters)
   ... there's an apparent cut scene?  (right when we see the credits for
       Supervising Producer Matt Selman, Marge has Homer by the shirt.  He
       then says: "Don't worry, Marge ..."

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Brian Beck:  I only laughed once, at Homer's attempt at singing "It's the End
   of the World as We Know It."  (and that saved it from an F).  There was
   also a chuckle at "... and penis is Russian for what?" There was a complete
   lack of coherency -- why was Bart digging that hole, why was Moe so
   depressed, etc.  The hunting scene was ridiculously contrived, and shooting
   Moe was not funny.  Why does Homer have to end up bloody in every episode?
   Maybe had they taken one of the subplots and used it for 30 minutes, it
   could have been good [...] but there was no real strong connecting thread.
   In conclusion, I'm following the advice of Mr. Tinky at the end of Trilogy
   of Error -- "This plot made no sense!  Tell the people!"  Except that
   Trilogy of Error made sense; this didn't.  Low  (D-)

Don Del Grande:  Okay, it started a little slow, especially after the "hole
   that went nowhere" (in more ways than one), but it picked up with the "m"
   and "Homer's Hunting Club" bits, only to come crashing back down to earth
   with the turkey hunt (right, as if a storyline is going to have Homer
   actually shoot a turkey, or even eat one, in front of Lisa) -- and what's
   with the "happy ending" ending?  (B+)

Alex Foley:  The Mike Scully era is ending with a wimper.  Yet again we have
   the beaten to the ground "Homer gets a new wacky job" episode, this time
   his filling in for Moe and then opening a bar in his home.  Worst off, it
   was Homer the Jerk, as the scene in which he lights up a cigarette for Lisa
   and the scene in which he makes Bart & Lisa work in the bar made me cringe.
   The episode was a series of weak gags strung together with a weak plot.
   R.E.M. was completely useless too boot.  The 3rd act was watchable (which
   is more then I can say for the first two acts), which raised this from an
   F, but it will still probably end up as one of the worst episodes ever when
   I look back at it in a few months.  (D)

Joe Green:  An improvement over last week's show, although it's still not
   quite up to speed.  My main complaint is about the pacing -- it spent so
   long on setting up the plot that it got rushed at the end, like a lot of
   recent OFF episodes. Still, the fact that Bart made his first prank call to
   Moe's in several seasons helped quite a bit.  (B-)

Zan Hecht:  Between "After Chernobyl, my penis fell off," "I'm losing my
   horny," Homer's blood literally gushing out THOH style, and several other
   gross-out gags, this episode is the crudest ever, finally beating
   "Skinner's Sense of Snow."  Also, while it is nice to see the "false start"
   plot style again, the Bart's hole plot ended too abruptly, and was really a
   cop-out (you could call it a plot hole).  However, there was some nice
   meta-humor ("It's fortunate that I just put this picture here, as it
   illustrates my point nicely").  Also, I noticed some nice continuity.  Last
   week, we saw Moe acting mean for no reason ("Yeah, now I rob people too"),
   and this week we find out why.  I believe that this is the first time the
   Simpsons have done a story arc (Maude's death isn't really a story arc
   because it is open-ended and has no resolution).  (B-)

Darrel Jones:  Not bad, but I'm somewhat disappointed.  Not because it was
   poor or too goofy, but the name was false advertising.  It should've been
   called "The New Moe's" or something.  Why does Homer have to get top
   billing if his plot takes up just one act?  Still, some good jokes and the
   "Dead Poet's Society"-type professor let me give it "seven thumbs up".
   7/10 or  (B+)

Kevin Muckenthaler:  Tonight's episode was almost completely unwatchable.  I
   can't believe the show has fallen so far under Mike Scully.  Pointless
   slapstick and violence, loads of vulgar humor, and pointless celebrity
   appearances do not a good episode make. The opening with Bart digging a
   hole was far more interesting than the rest of the episode, yet seemed just
   to be time-filler when it ended up being just Homer's crazy story.  The
   show was a collection of unrelated scenes and unfunny gags.  Suicide,
   ghost-visits, crotch jokes, dead rabbits, and Homer shooting Moe are not
   funny in my opinion.  (F)

Todd Willis:  Wow, all I can say is that this episode has to be on my top ten
   list of worst Simpsons episodes.  The episode totally lacked plot
   coherency, which would have been okay if the jokes were funny.  Alas, I had
   only about four good laughs during the entire episode, and maybe  a few
   chuckles.  I still don't understand the part about Moe's teacher walking
   into the water, was it supposed to be funny?  I don't get it!  On the plus
   side Homer did get another new job.  (Deep sarcasm)  A note to the writers
   please do entire Simpson family episodes, and stop concentrating on Homer
   and Bart.  (D-)

Yours Truly:  "Homer the Moe" had a good pseudo-bad beginning, and a funny
   middle section, but is let down by a shaky, rushed ending.  Until then,
   it's an entertaining story of what happens when Moe turns his bar into an
   upscale snob haven.  The blue-collar meets tragically-hip aspect of the
   story is solidly funny, and I liked Homer's retaliatory attempt to turn his
   garage into the next "old" Moe's.  R.E.M. is okay if not spectacular as
   Homer's house band.  Despite some risky jokes that don't pay off, and the
   weak ending, this is an entertaining bar story.  (B)

>> Musical References

Darrel Jones:  "Wolly Bully" -- Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs (1965):  Homer
   picks this for the jukebox.

   "Colour My World" -- Chicago (1971):  second song playing on the jukebox.

   "It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" -- REM (1987):
   performed at Homer's.


>> Meta-reference corner

Joe Green:  Homer's "shaggy-dog story" from the beginning seemed like a
   criticism of the kind of inane plots that have become common on OFF in
   recent seasons.

   Also, the "How'd you get your bar back to normal so quickly?" line at the
   end appeared to be a comment on how things usually go right back to the
   status quo at the end of episodes.


Chad Lehman:  Marge [says] "... and you don't even do your full time job."
   [This is a] commentary on how recent episodes rarely seem to show Homer at
   work.

   The ten second Lisa, Bart & Moe voice-over shot, used to explain how "m"
   turned back into "Moe's", is deceptively clever.  We were expecting a quick
   fix, but the voice-over shot is self-commentary on how they could have made
   up literally "anything", and voiced it over later.


>> Mo' Better Moes

Jeff Cross writes:  I think that the ep title has a secondary negative meaning
   to it.  I remember this first season episode of the hugely-successful CBS
   crime show "CSI" where Jorja Fox's character describes some bad guys as
   "moes."  I haven't been able to find a slang dictionary that defines it
   perfectly, but it could either be derivative of "moron" (if you pronounce
   it "moe-ron" like Stork did in "Animal House") or "mo-fo" (as in the vulgar
   description of Oedipus) or "mope" (as in the questionably moral people who
   take part in or cause riots).  The term has been around for at least a
   decade, since I heard about a Massachusetts North Shore music group called
   the Swanky Moes back in the early 1990s.


>> "If you keep digging like this, you're going to go straight through to China"

Can Bart theoretically dig his way to China?  Maybe not, says Benjamin
   Robinson:  I figured this out once, and if you start digging your hole from
   the eastern U.S., you'd really reach the Indian Ocean.  The easiest way to
   find the opposite side of the earth is to get your current coordinates, and
   then reverse them.  That is, if you're at 30 degrees north and 85 degrees
   west, then your tunnel would emerge at 30 degrees south and 85 degrees
   east.

   Well, actually, if you dug to the other side of the planet, you be
   incinerated by the Earth's molten core.  But that's not as much fun.


>> "I'm an Urban Lenny"

Shi Bao Nai explains:  In the radio business, "urban" is the adjective used to
   describe Rap/Hip-Hop stations, a sort of PC workaround for the word
   "black". There was actually a funny usage of that term on the Larry Sanders
   Show a few years back.  The musical guest was going to be the Wu-Tang Clan,
   and some studio executives were trying to talk Rip Torn (the producer, I
   think?) out of it.  They said, "We feel that the Wu-Tang Clan is a little
   ... urban for our demographics."  Torn replied, "Well, maybe I can call my
   friend Lenny Kravitz.  He's only half urban, will that help?"


>> The ultimate bar band

Benjamin Robinson writes:  The band playing at "Homer's Tavern" was none other
   than R.E.M., one of the most influential alternative rock bands of the late
   80s and early 90s (right up until Nirvana took primacy).  They are made up
   of front man Michael Stipe (the bald guy), guitarist Peter Buck (the guy
   with the dark hair and big eyebrows), and bassist Mike Mills (the blond guy
   with the glasses).  Had the guys gotten around to guest- voicing on the
   show earlier, they could have brought their drummer Bill Berry, but he took
   a permanent vacation from the group a couple years ago.

   At the garage, the boys were playing a staple of their live show, "It's the
   End of World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)."  When this song came out in
   1987, college students the world over put a lot of effort into deciphering
   the lyrics; Homer doesn't even come close, but it doesn't really seem to
   matter.

   R.E.M., and especially Stipe, always had a strong left-leaning social
   conscience.  The scene where the band swept up the broken bottle for
   recycling probably isn't that far off from reality.  R.E.M. was one of the
   first bands to invite activist groups (like Motor Voter and the ECO
   environmental group) along on their tours.  Lisa might also be interested
   to know that Michael Stipe helped start a vegetarian restaurant in the
   Atlanta area.

   The somewhat cynical among us might point out that R.E.M. and "The
   Simpsons" have something in common:  Both peaked about ten years ago and,
   while they still garner respect, aren't quite as good and hip as they used
   to be.  But that's just what the cynical people say.

	unholy leer, startling the guys]
Carl:	Don't do that.
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Moe gives it up; he hasn't genuinely smiled since he speared a rat
% with an ice pick.  He wishes that he still had the passion of his
% college days at Swigmore University.  (By amazing coincidence, he
% recently hung a painting of the campus in the bar.)

Carl:	Gee, uh, when you talk about that school, your voice fills 
	with, uh, what do you call it -- human feeling.
Lenny:	Yeah, maybe you should, uh, what's the expression -- go 
	back there.
Moe:	What's the word I'm searching for, uh -- yeah!  A trip to 
	the alma mater might really rekindle my love of getting 
	people loaded.
Carl:	But who'll run the bar while you're gone?
Homer:	[jumps up] Ooh!  Ooh!  Pick me!
Lenny:	Pick me -- Lenny!
Carl:	Oh, pick me; I'm an urban Lenny!
Moe:	Look, I don't want to start a tinkling contest here ... or 
	do I?
	[cut to the alley behind the bar.  Homer zips up his 
	trousers]
Homer:	Woo hoo!
Carl:	Oh, don't look so proud.  That was wind-assisted.
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Moe gives Homer some final instructions.

Moe:	... and if anyone wants potato chips or anything fancy, 
	tell him to go to Hell.
Homer:	Can do.  Now, don't you worry about a thing.  [gleefully 
	turns on a beer tap, spilling the beer onto the floor]
Moe:	[shuts off the tap] Hey, what are you doing?  I gotta pay 
	for that!
Homer:	No, Moe, you've got it all wrong.  People buy beer from 
	you.
-- The return of the Beer Baron, "Homer the Moe"

% Moe isn't confident the bar is in good hands, but he leaves anyway. 
% Before he gets two steps away, there's a huge explosion.  When Moe
% rushes back in, Homer looks at him nonchalantly and says, "I thought
% you had to go."
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 4:51]
%
% Moe arrives at the Swigmore U campus and does some reminiscing.
%
% Meanwhile, back at the tavern, Homer proves to be lenient bartender
% despite the picture of a scowling, shotgun-wielding Moe hanging over
% the bar.  Lenny, bringing in some food, trips on a barstool.  The
% food flies into the ceiling fan, sling mayo and ketchup all over the
% place.  Homer doesn't mind, bidding his customers to "shut up and
% dance."  The gang does so, dancing on the bar as "Wooly Booly" plays
% on the jukebox.  They start slow-dancing when the song switches to a
% more romantic number.  When the needle skips, Homer tries fixing it
% like the Fonz would, by banging the jukebox.  The trick doesn't work
% in real life, and Homer ends up breaking the jukebox's glass panel
% instead.  He bleeds profusely from his cut-up hand.
%
% Back on campus, a professor is giving a lecture on mixed drinks.

Professor:	Now, can any of you tell me how much grenadine is in 
		a Cosmopolitan?
		[the students murmur, not knowing the answer]
Moe:		None.  A Cosmopolitan is made with cranberry juice.
		[the class is impressed]
Professor:	Moe Szyslak, you old glasswipe!
-- "Homer the Moe"

% The phone rings at Moe's Tavern.

Homer:	[answering the phone] Yello?
	[split screen, with the other half showing Bart on the 
	couch at home]
Bart:	Uh, yeah, I'd like to speak with a Mr. Tabooger.  First 
	name, Ollie.
Homer:	Ooh, Bart!  My first prank call!  What do I do?
Bart:	Just ask if anyone knows Ollie Tabooger.
Homer:	I don't get it.
Bart:	Yell out, "I'll eat a booger."
Homer:	What's the gag?
Bart:	Oh, forget it.  [hangs up]
-- Homer's first -- and last -- prank call, "Homer the Moe"

% Moe talks with his old professor.

Moe:		Professor, I'm um, I'm burned out on bartending, I, 
		when I first saw the movie "Ironweed" I thought, you 
		know, this is for me.  But now, well, I'm not so 
		sure.
Professor:	Nonsense!  You were born to sling suds.  The problem 
		must lie elsewhere.  Describe your tavern, in one 
		word.
Moe:		Uh, is "crap hole" one word?
Professor:	Yes, if it's hyphenated.
Moe:		Then I'll stick with, "crap-hole."
Professor:	Well, no wonder you're depressed, working in that 
		environment.  If you want my advice, beautify your 
		hole, and you'll beautify your soul.
Moe:		Nice hole, nice soul.  Hmmm.
		[the two men are standing by a pond.  The sunset 
		glints on the water]
Professor:	Look at that pond.  Why doesn't water sparkle so?
		I'm dying, Moe.
Moe:		Is, is there anything I can do?
Professor:	No, unless you have a cure for cancer.  [turns to 
		Moe, hopefully] Do you have a cure for cancer?  
		'Cause that would be great!
Moe:		I'm sorry, Professor.
Professor:	Goodbye, Moe.
Moe:		Bye, Professor.
		[the professor walks calmly into the lake and 
		disappears beneath the surface]
		Hey, don't you want to take your shoes off before 
		you go swimming?  Professor?  [realizes] Oh.  Oh.  
		Um, hmmm.
		[slowly walks away from the lake]
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Homer's in a good mood as he goes to open the bar.

I'm a-walking down the street,
   Gonna open Moe's bar.
I'm a-singing what I'm thinking,  [points to a dog]
   Hey, look at that dog!
-- Homer Simpson, "Homer the Moe"

% A Homer approaches the bar, a barstool and a TV crash through the 
% front windows.  Teen vandals must be trashing the place!  Homer
% rushes in to defend the bar, but there's no need for alarm.  Moe has
% taken his professor's advice and begun remodeling.  Homer almost,
% but doesn't quite, faint at the news.

Homer:		What are you doing?
Moe:		My professor said if I prettied up this dump, it 
		would renew my zeal.
Homer:		And it would look pretty, too.
Moe:		And now, I want you to meet the guy who's going to 
		help bring Moe's into the twentieth century.
Formico:	I am Formico, the Dean of Design.
Homer:		Hi, Formico.
Formico:	[holding a hand to Homer's lips] Uh, uh, uh -- my 
		name must never be spoken.
Homer:		Sorry.  [whispers to Moe] He seems nice.
-- Michael Payne would've been friendlier, though, "Homer the Moe"

% It's nice that Moe has his old enthusiasm back, but that means Homer
% is out of a bartending job.  He's reduced to pouring drinks and
% fetching cigarettes for his children.
%
% Eventually, the new Moe's (rechristened "m") is ready for business. 
% A long line forms in front of the cubic, glass-paneled building. 
% Two spotlights shine the "m" logo in the night sky.  Barney, Carl,
% Lenny, and Homer admire the scene.

Barney:	Wow, check out the new Moe's!
Homer:	Wow, it looks like an alien headquarters.  Couldn't you 
	just see aliens running out of there?  Couldn't ya?
	[notices that the rest of his friends have already started 
	towards the bar]
	Hey, wait up!
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Homer assumes that, as a friend of the owner, he and his buddies can
% cut to the head of the line.  The bouncer, Cecil, doubts this but
% Moe, dressed in a mod-looking suit, appears at the front door to let
% the guys in.
%
% The inside of the bar looks kind of like an alien headquarters, too. 
% The old dank and dark look has been swept away in favor of new,
% bright color palette.  There's a large bubbling water sculpture by
% one wall.  Flat-screen monitors hang on the walls and from strategic
% spots on the ceiling.  They show a repeating loop of an eyeball
% blinking and looking around.  Pop music plays from a hidden sound
% system, and some of the bar-goers can dance on the spacious floor.

Moe:	Welcome to "m," hah?  Heh, heh.  So, what do you think of 
	the new joint?
Lenny:	Wow, this place looks like it's from the not-too-distant 
	future.
Moe:	Yeah.  You like it, Homer?
Homer:	[looking at live rabbits wiggling in harnesses suspended 
	from the ceiling] Um, the rabbits are cute.
Lenny:	Eh, that one ain't moving.  [points to a still rabbit]
Moe:	[snaps, summoning an aide] Uh, change number 7.
Carl:	I don't get all this eyeball stuff.  Uh, what are they 
	supposed to represent?  Uh, eyeballs?
Moe:	It's po-mo!  [blank stares from all]
	Post-modern!  [more staring]
	Yeah, all right -- weird for the sake of weird.
Guys:	Oooh!
-- "Homer the Moe"

% The tour continues.

Carl:		Where are the barstools?
Moe:		Up there.  [points to the ceiling, where the 
		barstools are attached, upside-down]  Ain't it 
		trippy?
Homer:		Uh, whatever, just give me a Duff.
Moe:		Oh, we don't serve Duff no more.  We got a Malaysian 
		beer that's better than Duff.  It's made out of soy 
		sauce.
		[hands Homer a bottle]
Homer:		Uh, whatever.  Just give me a Duff.
Moe:		Hey, Formico!  Uh, say hello to my beloved regulars.
		[Formico comes over]
Formico:	Oh!  Hello.  [unscrews the bulb from the light 
		fixture immediately over the guys, forming a cone of 
		darkness that blots them from view]
		Moe, would you like to see some attractive young 
		models?
Moe:		Models?  Ah, oh, boy!  [he and Formico leave.  
		Before he goes, Formico signals his assistants to 
		come in and rope off Moe's beloved regulars]
Homer:		Okay -- look cool.
-- That should be easy, "Homer the Moe"

% Moe schmoozes with a trio of Russian models, who sadly admit they
% think Moe is attractive.
%
% Meanwhile, the boys try out m's oxygen bar, but they don't see much
% point in it.  Lenny gets trapped in a man-size hamster wheel.  Homer
% vows to tell Moe what he thinks of his new-fangled bar, but doesn't
% go far before coming back for more oxygen.
%
% Moe is still talking with the models.

Model 1:	After Chernobyl, my penis ... is falling off.
Moe:		And "penis" is Russian for ... ?
Homer:		[the regulars up to Moe's booth] Moe, we want our 
		bar back!
Lenny:		Yeah, this place is crazy.
Carl:		All these beautiful people make us feel like losers.
Moe:		Hey, you'd be having a great time if you'd stayed in 
		your dark spot.
Homer:		Oh, so you're ashamed of us.  Well, you turned into 
		a big phony!
Moe:		Hey, nobody calls Moe St. Cool a phony.
Model 2:	All this yelling is taking away my horny.
Moe:		Is it?  Oh, well, that's it, that -- Detmar, Julian!  
		[two bouncers come over] Throw this bum out.
Homer:		I'll throw myself out, thank you.
		[grabs his shirt collar, yanks himself toward the 
		front door, and tosses himself to the street]
		I believe I had a hat!  [someone throws him a hat]
		Suckers!  [laughs and runs away]
-- "Homer the Moe"

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 12:42]
%
% To make up for the loss of his favorite pub, Homer remodels his
% garage into a tavern.  He installs a urinal by nailing it to the
% garage wall.

Marge:	Running a bar is a full-time job -- and you don't even do 
	your full-time job.
Homer:	Well, when I'm passionate about something, I see it 
	through to the end.
	[moves some boxes, uncovering a half-finished robot]
Robot:	Father, give me legs.
	[Homer tosses out the robot]
	[imploring] Father!  [Homer isn't moved, and the robot 
	drags himself away on his "arms"]
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Back at m ...

Lady 1:	That is so interesting.
Moe:	So what you talking about, something interesting?
Man 1:	I was just comparing Kurusawa's films to Herzog.
Moe:	Uh-huh.  Carry on.
	[Moe overhears two other customers]
Man 2:	My diet lets me eat anything I want for one minute a day.
Lady 2:	My youth consultant gives me Botox injections in my head, 
	neck, and navel.
	[Moe sighs and walks off.  He approaches a lone man at the 
	end of the bar]
Moe:	Hiya, pal.  So, uh, how about them current events?
	[the man points to the cell phone he's using]
	Oh, ya one of those cell phones, eh?  Yeah, no, no cord at 
	all, on those ...
	[perks up] Hey, the game's on!  [uses a remote control to 
	tune one of the video eyeball screens to a football game]
Crowd:	Hey!  I was watching that!  Come on!  [etc.]
Man 3:	Unless you're being ironic, turn that off now!
	[Moe does do]
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Moe picks up a framed photograph of his late professor.

Moe:		I'm glad you ain't around to see what a mess I made.
Professor:	[spectral] Oh, but I am.
		[Moe turns around to see the ghost of the Professor 
		floating behind him]
Moe:		Wha?!
Professor:	You discarded your loyal regulars for a mob of 
		soulless snobs.
Moe:		Well, uh, at least the tips are good.
Professor:	Are they, Moe?  Take a look.
		[indeed, the jar is as empty as when we first saw 
		it]
Moe:		[disgusted] Oh!
Professor:	[laughs maniacally]
Moe:		Why are you mocking me?  We're friends.
Professor:	Oh, right.  Sorry.
-- The ghost of bartending past, "Homer the Moe"

% The mood is lighter at Homer's new tavern, where he and his cronies
% are singing a rousing drinking song.

Guys:	[to the tune of "I Love Rock and Roll"]
	I won't drink at Moe's,
	   Homer's old garage is all I need.
	I won't drink at Moe's,
Homer:	   'Cause he's a big jerk and a she-male, too.
Lenny:	That calls for another beer.
Homer:	[to Marge] Barkeep!
Marge:	I thought this was gonna be your bar.
Homer:	It's a family bar, right kids?
	[cut to Bart and Lisa, who are washing glasses and cutting 
	up lemons]
Lisa:	Can we go to bed now?
Homer:	As soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.
Lisa:	But you're not even using them.
Homer:	[mock baby-talk] She's so sweepy, she doesn't even know 
	what she's saying.
Carl +
 Lenny:	Aww.
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Back at *his* bar, Moe realizes he hasn't been true to his character
% or his loyal regulars.  He tears off his "cool" suit, revealing his
% regular clothing underneath, and walks away.

How could I toss my friends out into the cold?  With no place to get 
liquored up?
-- Moe Szyslak, "Homer the Moe"

% Moe walks by Homer's house, and is surprised to find that Homer's
% "bar" has drawn a big crowd.  Even his house band is impressive --
% it's R.E.M., and they're playing "It's the End of the World as We
% Know It (And I Feel Fine)."

Homer:	[singing along]
	Leonardo what-his-name, Herman Munster motorcade,
	Birthday party Cheet-Os(tm) , pogo sticks and lemonade,
	Idiotic stupid jerk, that's right Flanders, I am talking 
	about you.
Lenny:	How'd you get R.E.M. to play at your garage?
Homer:	I told them it was a benefit.  They think they're saving 
	the rainforest!
	[the guys all laugh]
Carl:	Suckers.
-- "Homer the Moe"

% The band winds up the song.  Peter isn't certain that Homer and his
% friends are the billionaires they claim to be.  Michael (Stipe)
% figures the story's got to be true, because a poor person wouldn't
% have a bar in his garage.  Mike (Mills) tries to use the urinal, but
% can't with Lenny watching.
%
% Moe opens the garage door.

Moe:		What the ...?  You can't open your own bar.
Homer:		Seems to me I already did.
Moe:		But it's illegal.  You, you can't run a bar in a 
		private residence.
Homer:		Bar?  I see no bar.  This is a hunting club.  
		[points to a sign reading, "Homer's Hunting Club"]  
		Which is permitted by state law [picks up a law 
		book] "to serve beverages of a refreshing nature."
Moe:		Hunting club?
Michael:	You lied to us!  [smashes a beer bottle, and holds 
		the jagged end threateningly]
Homer:		[yelps] Aaah!  [Mike and Peter hold Michael back]
Mike:		Michael, no!
Peter:		That's not the R.E.M. way.
Michael:	You're right.  Let's recycle those shards and get 
		out of here.  [they sweep up the glass and leave]
-- "Homer the Moe"

% Consulting Homer's legal book, Moe finds a regulation stating that
% there's more to hunting clubs than refreshing beverage service.  A
% club must also engage in the sport of hunting.  Over Lisa's
% objections, Homer says he'll go hunting tomorrow.
%
% The next day, Lisa is still trying to persuade her father to drop
% the hunting idea.  Homer presses on anyway and sets up a dish with
% cranberry sauce, stuffing, and potatoes, hoping that a turkey will
% come along to complete the picture.  Frustrated, Lisa walks away.

Moe:	[from the bushes] Lisa!
Lisa:	Moe?
Moe:	[stands up] Listen, I don't like you, you don't like me, 
	but we both want to stop Homer from shooting a turkey.
Lisa:	You don't like me?  I like you.
Moe:	You do?  Then I like you, too.  Here, have a towelette.  
	[gives her one]
-- Mutual affection, "Homer the Moe"

% Homer tries to call a turkey by literally yelling, "Here, turkey,
% turkey, turkey!"  Moe tries to set up a more sophisticated system
% with Lisa.

Moe:	From now on, no talking.  If you want to signal me, use 
	this bird call.  [whistles like a bird.  An eagle swoops 
	down and pecks Moe on the face] Ow!  Not the face!  [the 
	bird switches to Moe's groin] Ooh!  Ooh!  Okay, the face!  
	[the bird switches back] Ooh!  Whoa, that actually feels 
	good after the, after the crotch.
-- Relative threshold of pain, "Homer the Moe"

% Meanwhile, Homer still is on the hunt for "the only animal smarter
% than man" -- a turkey.  He gets one in his sights and, eventually,
% identifies it as his quarry.  Before Homer can shoot, Moe scares the
% bird away with a cougar call -- and takes a bullet in the leg when
% Homer fires at the "cougar" instead.  When Homer realizes his
% mistake, he faints for real.
%
% Cut to a still picture of Moe's Tavern, restored to its former
% glory.

Lisa:	[voice-over] How'd you get the bar back to normal so 
	quickly, Moe?
Moe:	[voice-over] It's a snap when you use certified 
	contractors.
Bart:	[voice-over] Like the ones found in your local yellow 
	pages?
Moe:	Exactly.
-- "Homer the Moe"

% The Simpson family, R.E.M., and Moe have Thanksgiving dinner in
% Moe's newly re-renovated bar.

Homer:		[putting down a platter with a cooked turkey on it]
		I'm sorry I shot you, Moe.
Moe:		Ah, that's okay.  It's like my Dad always said:  
		Eventually, everybody gets shot.
Marge:		Oh, I'm glad you two are friends again, so we can 
		all have Thanksgiving dinner together in this bar.
Homer:		Hey, who invited the hippies?  [indicates R.E.M.]
Lisa:		I did.  You owe R.E.M. an apology for eco-fraud.
Homer:		All right, I'm sorry.  But I will not save the 
		rainforest.
Peter:		Good enough.  Let's eat.
Lisa:		And we can all be thankful to Michael, Peter, and 
		Mike, for supplying this beautiful turkey, made 
		entirely of tofu.
Mike:		Tofu *and* gluten.
Bart:		I'm thankful I ate before I came.
Michael:	Aw, come on, Bart, smell those curds.  Mmmm ... 
		curds.
-- It's curdilicious, "Homer the Moe"

% Homer says he's thankful to spend the day with his family, Moe, and
% "these alternative rockers."  Then, he deposits perhaps the first
% tip ever in Moe's jar.  Moe rings the bell, the two men smile, and
% the scene fades to black.

% [End of Act Three.  20:16]
