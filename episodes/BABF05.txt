Blackboard:     I CAN'T SEE DEAD PEOPLE

                I CAN'T SEE DE  / at cutoff

Couch:          The family runs to the couch, which quickly sucks them in, and
                shreds them, like a piece of paper.  (It's not as gruesome as
                it sounds -- the come out looking like a photograph of the
                Simpsons, cut into vertical strips.)

> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================

Kyle Bastian:
   ... the Springfield Elementary Staff were at church?
   ... the couples that were not at the dance-off were the Flanderses, the
       Lovejoys, the Van Houtens, and the Hibberts (maybe Dr. Hibbert and his
       wife wanted to go-go to a 70s disco diner owned by Disco Stu)?
   ... the Hibberts were also in church?
   ... Barney is missing in the bike group?
   ... Agnes allows her Seymour to date Edna?
   ... Mrs. Van Houten is alone in church (can Kirk convert to Judaism)?
   ... only one voice was missing: Marcia Mitzman-Gaven?

Ril Chaim:
   ... Lisa was reading a social studies book, when she could have been
       studying a real social phenomenon in her own home?

Brian Corvello:
   ... Homer has apparently gotten a lot stronger, and become a much better
       fighter than he usually is?  He was able to fight Meat Hook -- a
       hardened criminal -- to a standstill, using a motorcycle as a weapon
       (last I checked, motorcycles were HEAVY).
   ... even though she has disliked the criminal element in the past, Marge
       acts awfully civil to the gang, even after they say that they don't
       find her attractive?
   ... after Bart takes the tacked message off Homer's head, he replaces the
       tack there?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Homer lives in a state where there aren't any helmet laws?  [Or he
       does, but ignores the law -- Ed.]
   ... NRBQ is playing at Poppa Wheelie's?  [See "Comments" section for more -
       - Ed.]
   ... Homer tried to remember the quote "Fish and houseguests stink after
       three days"?

Curtis Gibby:
   ... that Dan Castellaneta voiced the faceless guy?
   ... that Homer said "what an age we live in" twice in the first two minutes
       of the show?
   ... Rev. Lovejoy was trying to discuss the story of the Samaritan woman at
       the well?
   ... we saw pictures of Homer, Grandpa, and Maggie on OFF's walls in this
       episode?
   ... the bikers want to take Marge to an orgy, despite the fact that none of
       them find her sexually attractive?

Joe Green:
   ... Homer tries to "pedal" while learning to ride?
   ... Carl's scooter is from Hertz?

Richard E. Green:
   ... John Frink was listed as a producer!?
   ... Ike "Let's get buuusssy" Eisenhower was on a big Time poster at the
       restaurant?
   ... Ramrod was actually stabbing a knife into his leg?
   ... Jan Hooks got guest star credit for this episode ... is she gonna
       become a semi-regular like Phil was?
   ... this is the first time in a LONG time that they've showed full-screen
       credits during a fox episode ... and only the second time that I know
       of where there was a live-action sequence?

Carl Johnson:
   ... Homer and the gang were on the wrong side of the road when telling
       Wiggum they haven't broken any laws?

Darrel Jones:
   ... Apu and Manjula are dining at Greaser's when OFF enter?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Homer doesn't feel any pain when a pin stuck on the back of his head?
   ... Homer discovers about Marge's disappearance at 10:00 AM?
   ... this is the first non-Halloween episode to feature a live-action scene?

Adam Long:
   ... Bart munching on popcorn in the opening scene?
   ... Skinner & Edna, Clancy & Sarah, and Apu & Manjula at Greaser's?
   ... Apu and Manjula are wearing the exact same costumes they wore in the
       conception scene of "Eight Misbehavin'"?
   ... Hans Moleman works at Greaser's?
   ... the "Cool Cat" on the bathroom door looks a lot like Scratchy?
   ... Swartzwelder has some recent obsession with Homer divorcing Marge?
   ... the training wheels on Homer's motorcycle?
   ... Homer is watching the "Tuesday Morning Movie", yet neither him nor Lisa
       is at work/school?
   ... Homer calls Apu "Pops"?
   ... Marge knows Meathook's name even though he never says it?
   ... Bart and Lisa make the motions like they're eating before they realize
       they don't have any food?
   ... Lisa wonders why she's not at school, but not Bart?
   ... the guys playing darts on the unconscious man's back at Poppa
       Wheelie's?
   ... nobody in Meathook's gang tosses him another bike when he loses his?
   ... Marge drives the motorcycle home?

Tom Rinschler:
   ... each time there is a new establishing shot while the biker gang is in
       residence, OFF's house and yard are in progressively worse shape?
   ... Manjula has a speaking part for the first time in an episode that isn't
       focused on her?
   ... Marge rides sidesaddle when with Homer at the end?

Nic Unicu:
   ... in the photo of the Hell's Satans, Moe was not smilin'?

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Wilson Banswell:  Wow.  A pretty good episode.  There were some really good
   scenes, like Homer and Marge's dance, and the church scene.  Also, the
   biker's interaction with Marge was great.  And it was good that the episode
   was not directed at the guest voices and Homer.  However, there some minor
   flaws such as the whole Homer getting beat up at the bar scene.  Overall, a
   good effort  (B+)

Nate Birch:  One good thing I can say about Swartzwelder's latest, is it at
   least feels like a Simpsons episode, no weird lines (i.e. Bart on about
   testicles), or overly cartoony stuff, it felt just like I was watching a
   lackluster season 6 or 7 ep.  This was actually a fairly funny episode,
   although it didn't have any huge laughs, it was fairly funny throughout,
   and while the plot may have been pretty simple, at least it had a definite
   3 acts, and a decent ending.  John Goodman gave a pretty good performance,
   and the fact that the animation was the best it's been in a few seasons
   pushes the rating up a bit.  (B+)

Nicholas di Candia:  This is Swartzwelder's best since "The Old Man and the
   Lisa".  Almost everything shines: the first act at the 50's restaurant,
   Bart teaching Homer how to ride the motorbike, Marge mothering the real
   Hell's Satans.  But some bits don't work, like Homer annoying everyone with
   the motorbike noise (but thankfully it didn't last long).  The Hell's
   Satans attitude towards Marge was very funny and unexpected.  This season
   is becoming a big improvement in quality over the previous.  (B)

John Cordner:  This episode is one of the best this season.  [...] Like the
   dance scene; classic, the fact that Homer starts a gang and Lenny and Carl
   didn't have motorcycles I thought was good.  Ned joining the "club" and
   trying to change the name was pretty good.  Rod and Todd spying on Lisa was
   disturbing but in the same point funny.  I thought it was hilarious that
   neither of the bikers found Marge attractive.  The last act was not as
   good.  I agree the bike fighting bit was a bit much but the scene when
   homer goes into the bar and all you can here is a guy saying "Hey!" and
   Homer screams and runs out with a keg of Duff ... that is so classic.  I
   loved the blackboard gag!  That is my new favorite one next to "Bewitched
   doesn't promote Satanism" I give it about an  (A-)

Don Del Grande:  I demand to know who stole Swartzwelder's name and tried to
   pass this one off as one of his.  Call me crazy, but a minute of watching
   the bikers do their best Homer impressions just doesn't seem funny, so you
   can imagine how I feel about pretty much an entire segment of it.  And why
   choose today to make Rod and Todd break character?  (C)

Bill Franklin:  This was perhaps one of the worst ever, at least for me.  All
   the jokes, and I mean all, fell flat.  I actually had hope for this
   episode.  It showed some promise.  Even the first act wasn't so bad.  But
   than the second act came.  It was plain stupid.  The whole "Homer in the
   bar" thing, that made me almost turn off the TV.  Anyway I give this
   Simpsons "episode" a  (D)

Curtis Gibby:  This certainly was an odd episode.  I liked the bikers'
   disagreement on the pronunciation of resume, among other random things.
   John Goodman was a pretty good guest voice, too.  I thought that the best
   part of the episode was NRBQ's performance of the Simpsons End Title.
   Overall, it was slightly too Homer-centric for my tastes, but pretty darn
   funny.  It earns a  (B+)

Joe Green:  This may have been predictably "wacky Homer"-centric episode with
   no deep meaning ... but God help me, it was also extremely funny.  The most
   entertaining moments included Homer's pathetic excuse for a biker gang and
   Marge taming the Hell's Satans.  (A+)

Richard E. Green:  Not quite a "Homer gets a job" episode, but pretty close.
   Either way John Swartzwelder kept me interested.  Sure, everyone seemed
   REALLY out of character (WTF was with Marge's super-happy attitude this
   week?) but at least we got to see some new sides, plus plenty of scenery
   ... and HOMER wasn't even the standout character!  Could've used a vampire
   and some more funny lines though -- favourite part was the biker drinking
   from the toilet.  (B)

Carl Johnson:  Ho hum ho hum.  Nothing great.  Not that bad.  I think it's
   more than slightly better than "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"
   but not near as good as "E-I-E-I-D'oh!".  This ep had its moments, sure,
   but, a lot of it was just stupid -- like most of the scenes where the
   roadhogs trash the Simpson place, and the 50's announcer howling and
   coughing.  The dance sequence was fun, and it was cute seeing Marge teach
   the Hell's Satans some manners, but the bad scenes outnumbered the good and
   it wasn't funny enough for such a silly premise.  The definite improvement
   over season ten still remains though.  (D+)

Haynes Lee:  A terribly disjointed episode that is has the bad taste akin of
   South Park.  Henry Winkler's guest voice was totally wasted and out of
   character from his famous role as the Fonz.  (D-)

Ondre Lombard:  Take My Wife Sleaze was a well-produced and funny episode that
   did not overemphasize on things that wouldn't go far (like Homer in
   general, and his biker gang), but rather goes places, and within confines
   of reality, too. (A sort of reality, anyway.)  It's refreshing to see Marge
   act as a lead character again instead of Homer's soundboard, and it's also
   refreshing to see good direction and good animation and decent character
   design.  A solid episode.  (B)

Adam Long:  Season 11 continues with another episode whose premise could
   easily have been overdone, but turned out somewhat believable.  Lots of
   funny stuff (especially Moe suggesting the gang be called the "Christ
   Punchers"!!!), but I think the episode starts to go downhill a little when
   the real Hell's Satans take over the house.  The idea of Rod and Todd as
   peepers was funny though, and I liked the scenes with Homer at the bar (I
   was expecting a Pee-Wee's Big Adventure spoof here, but alas there was
   none), but other than that the second half moved kind of slow.  (B)

Patrick McGovern:  It's as good as to be expected from the premise- I didn't
   expect much.  This had some good characterization and fair guest work, but
   it was very derivative, boring, and just ... well, not funny.  The biker
   jokes wore awfully thin, too. Still, every season is allowed a clunker, so
   let's just call this a write off and forget about it.  (D)

Abhi Ray:  What could have been an obnoxious and boring Homer's Crazy Schemes
   episode like "Maximum Homerdrive" was, this episode was instead
   well-written and funny. Homer's ludicrous Hell's Satans gang was hilarious.
   Homer never went overboard. And I even liked the caperish ending.  Still,
   there was some tasteless humor.  (B)

Tom Rinschler:  Basically a pretty good episode, although it had its minor
   flaws. The plot, while not linear, at least progressed reasonably
   logically, and there was a distinct lessening of over-the-top
   cartoonishness compared to the last few weeks (although it was still there
   at times). Homer's biker gang was hilarious, and "Marge as mother figure"
   has never been more fully explored or been more comical than when she
   becomes the bikers' "den mother".  (B+)

Eric Sansoni:  All the wit, subtlety, clever dialogue, and charming characters
   The Simpsons is known and loved for are absent from this loud, raucous,
   obnoxious, hollow, confusing, painfully dumb, predictable, freakishly
   unfunny script.  The attempt at comedy here seems founded on the idea of
   driving motorcycles indoors and flat, unexamined biker movie stereotypes,
   peppered with warped retreads of classic Simpsons scenes.  The season 10
   trends of wildly inconsistent quality and all-time worst episodes written
   by long-time writer John Swartzwelder return.  His drafts are rumored to be
   rewritten by staff only now, and seem shamefully filled with the least
   inspired bits deemed not good enough for their own scripts.  (D)

Yours Truly:  "Take My Wife" has some funny scenes of Homer's makeshift
   motorcycle gang bumbling around Springfield, as expected, but this episode
   works for a different reason.  It finds an interesting angle to its
   premise, as Marge surprisingly civilizes a real motorcycle gang.  The
   opening scenes skewering 50s nostalgia and theme dining are a hoot.  NRBQ
   fans should have a field day here, aside from the live-action credits they
   provide much of the incidental music, plus a cool tune during the "learning
   to ride" montage.  There's some over-cartoonishness and overbearing Homer,
   but overall it's a good ride for the show.  (A-)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Writer Watch

Nicholas di Candia:  Writer Watch John Swartzwelder is the only person who
   wrote episodes in every season of The Simpsons.  He wrote some classic
   episodes like "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge", "Rosebud" and "Life on the Fast
   Lane", plus some generally disliked ones, like "Homer Simpson in 'Kidney
   Trouble'" or "Monty Can't Buy Me Love". He isn't currently on staff, he
   writes episodes with storylines that are given to him by the actual staff
   (which may explain why some of his more recent episodes aren't as memorable
   as some of the older).  His episodes tend to have a first act that has
   absolutely nothing to do with the central plot, but adds laughs.


>> Tonight's guest stars

Haynes Lee:  Henry Winkler is most famous as playing the clean cut Fonz biker
   character on Happy Days (1974-1984). The Fonz was unlike the character
   Ramrod he voiced in this episode.


>> "Smithers, have the Rolling Stones killed."

Speaking of guest stars, tonight's show also featured a guest musical act --
   NRBQ.  Many people identified them as the band playing the "Simpsons" theme
   live at the end of the episode.  As "Writersmjs" explains, their music was
   woven throughout the rest of the show.


"Writersmjs":  Yes, that was NRBQ singing "Me and the Boys", from their albums
   "Tiddlywinks" and "The Best of NRBQ".  In the same episode, they also sang
   "Lucille" when the family entered the 50's diner, "Mayonnaise and
   Marmalade" (written by Simpsons writers, for montage of Bart teaching Homer
   to ride the motorcycle), and "Want You to Feel Good, Too" as the band at
   the biker bar.  [Later, he writes, "The [closing theme] piece was shot in
   the Bowery Ballroom in New York."]


Paul Fredrickson identifies the "Mayonnaise and Marmalade" singer as Joey
   Spampinato, NRBQ's bassist (And singer.  And songwriter.)


J. Wilson notes that the initials "NRBQ" stand for "New Rhythm and Blues
   Quartet."  Now you know.


>> And the record for least amount of taste in a TV special is ...

Richard E. Green:  "The Guinness Book of World Records" show seemed to be
   parodying this book-turned-into-TV show that was on FOX last year, except
   the actual show was hosted by some random sports announcer looking for off-
   season work (see "The World's Funniest" and some of those clip shows for
   more of them).  The TV show actually had the largest tumor removed from a
   person, but MOST of the features on the show are not even RECORDS, just
   crazy stunts or first-time attempts at something, but they usually try to
   tact on some kind of record to make it on topic, such as "longest time that
   two people held together only by a curved pipe that the two people are
   holding in their mouths can stay balanced on top of each other".


Joe Klemm adds:  During the summer of 1998, the Fox network aired a series
   based on the Guinness Book of World Records.  The show featured segments
   that ranged from people attempting or make or break world records and
   profiles of different world records.  The show, thanks to the summer
   period, was such a hit that Fox kept it as part of the 1998-1999 season.
   However, with the return of new episodes of shows on other networks,
   Guinness didn't achieve the same success as it did during the summer, and
   it didn't make the 1999-2000 fall schedule.


>> Car Watch:  The Fabulous Fifties

Benjamin Robinson:  For his commercial, Wolfguy Jack drives a 1956 Ford
   Thunderbird, one of the classic two-seater models built between 1955 and
   1957.  In the background, there's a yellow-ish 1959 Cadillac, the one with
   the "Godzilla" fins, in parking lot.  Wolfguy didn't just pick these two at
   random -- both cars have become emblematic of 1950s America.

   Inside the café, one of the booths was either made from, or made to look
   like it came from, a Nash Metropolitan.  Look for orange car; I believe
   that was Skinner and Krabappel sitting in it.  The Met was an early attempt
   at catering to the burgeoning second-car market during the Fifties.  It was
   a two-seater, and was intended for use around the city, rather than as a
   family's only car.


>> The Beatles Unite

Nicholas di Candia:  The fifties restaurant had this headline, among other
   anachronisms.  In reality, the Beatles didn't use that name until 1960.
   The core of the Beatles got together in 1957 as The Quarrymen.  But the
   union of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr
   didn't happen until August 1962.


>> Road Warriors

Benjamin Robinson:  Motorcycles were introduced at the turn of the century,
   shortly after the invention of the four-wheeled automobile, and quickly
   gained an aura adventurousness and rebellion.  After the Second World War,
   that process quickened, as "gangs" of motorcycle enthusiasts began to form.
   While many of them just wanted to ride around, drink beer, and ride some
   more, some of the gangs got caught up in criminal activity.  Hollywood
   picked up on this, and cranked out a bunch of low-budget movies depicting
   all motorcyclists as leather-wearing hoodlums.  The films were similar to
   the Grade-B flick that Homer saw.  This became sort of a self-fulfilling
   image, as troublemakers came to be drawn to motorcycles, while law-abiding
   people shied away.  (Although a core group of dedicated, and lawful,
   enthusiasts continued to ride.)

   That began to change in the Sixties.  The Japanese began making inroads
   with smaller, less-threatening cycles.  Meanwhile, rebellion began being
   seen as a *good* thing.  As the Sixties generation grew up and gathered
   some discretional income, they bought motorcycles.  Partly, it was to get
   that image of adventure and "bad-ass-ness" (which did not thrill longtime
   bikers).  Partly, it was to reclaim their youth.  And partly it was because
   of an appreciation of the motorcycles themselves, in particular the flashy
   Harley-Davidson bikes.  Today's most sought-after bikes resemble those old
   vintage models, making the authentic 1955 H-D that Homer won all the more
   valuable.  (Perhaps even too valuable to use daily, as Homer does.)


Meanwhile, Haynes Lee warns:  Starting a club chapter is a very complicated
   process.  Starting one without permission will result in death.


"Jabbalvr" corroborates:  There was an incident when [Dan Aykroyd] drew the
   ire of some actual Hell's Angels by copying their insignias on some
   motorcycle jackets for a sketch [on "Saturday Night Live"].  The Angels
   became a lot friendlier after Aykroyd returned their "colors" and showed
   his respect.


Haynes Lee adds:  "Hell's Angels" was a famous 1930 movie about RCAF pilots.
   I don't know if that's what the motorcycle gang is named after but they did
   form shortly after WWII.


>> License to Ride

Ondre Lombard, in the "Goofs" section, noted:  The episode doesn't seem to
   make any indications that Homer applies and takes a test for a class-M
   vehicle to legally drive the motorcycle.


Jim Pearson responds:  Varies by state ... now we have more fodder for the
   "What State is Springfield In?" argument, eh?

   On the other hand -- come now, a Bad Boy On A Hog hardly needs a LICENSE!
   (Or a helmet, for that matter ... and the lack thereof seemed a bit
   careless ... but when Flanders was the only character wearing one ... it
   went from "careless" to "mocking a responsible decision," which surprised
   me.)


>> That's why she's Cycle Slut of the Month

Nate Birch keenly observes:  Wow, Marge is still pretty hot for a woman in her
   late 30's, she doesn't seem to work out though, and it seems like she eats
   pork chops every night, she's even had 3 kids ... but the real question is,
   what the heck is she doing married to Homer?


>> Will Mickey Rourke be there?

Joe Klemm:  Every summer, an annual biker rally takes place at Sturgess, South
   Dakota. Thousands of bike owners make the trip to South Dakota and hang out
   with their fellow bikers.  Recently, a wrestling league has chosen the
   biker rally as the site of an annual PPV event, thus making the rally more
   familiar to others.


>> It's still easier than dueling with SUVs

No, you can't fence with motorcycles.  Everyone knows that, including the
   writers.  The motorcycle fight was a deliberate error, which is why it's
   not included in the "Goofs" section.


David Chesler adds this interesting side note:  A light UJM (Universal
   Japanese Motorcycle, e.g. a mid-1970s Honda CB360) would weigh in at about
   360 pounds (yes, still too heavy to fence with or for Marge to toss up to
   Homer); 1000 pounds if full-dress cruiser size (e.g. Goldwing); a Harley
   chopper would be a little less.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Sleazy Rider


Jeff Cross:  Some alternate titles: "Easy Ri-D'oh!" and "Rebel Without A
   Clue", although the second was from a Tom Petty song


Andrew Levine (and Joe Green, a little later) suggests:  The Fabulous Biker
   Boys


Richard E. Green [who I assume is no relation]:  Where Springfield ISN'T --
   Michigan or South Dakota.


Aaron Hirshberg:  You can drive a motorcycle from Bakersfield to where the
   Simpsons live with relative ease.  Some clue!


Richard E. Green, again:  Act 2 timed in at 10:13 ... is this the longest act
   ever?  (I think that title previously went to one act of 3F22 ... but I'm
   too lazy to look it up).  [I wasn't.  Act 2 of "Summer of 4 Foot 2" was 11
   minutes, 9 seconds long -- Ed.]


Don Del Grande:  It's the first live action ending for a NON-HALLOWEEN SPECIAL
   episode.


Darrel Jones:  The whole Benjamin Franklin quote, from his "Poor Richard's
   Almanac", is "Fish and visitors stink in three days".  [Adam Bailey says
   it's, "smell."]  A rather appropriate saying, and I'm surprised Homer knew
   it.

Homer:		Ah, we'll go next month.
-- No time like the future for the past, "Take My Wife, Sleaze"

% True to Homer's word, the family goes to Greaser's one month later.  
% It is indeed a cornucopia of Fifties kitsch.  In addition to the
% standard chrome fixtures, pastel colors, and bouncy upbeat music on
% the jukebox, the booths are made out of period cars.  Waitresses
% roller-skate from one customer to another, just like they didn't way
% back when.  Newspaper headlines of the era, like "Beatles Unite!"
% decorate the walls.
%
% The restrooms carry the theme by being labeled "Cool Cats" and

% No dice -- that one's for the ladies, too.
%
% Jay North, who played "Dennis the Menace" on TV, sits in a booth to

Bart:	Dennis the Menace?
North:	Yes, I was America's bad boy.  I once hid my dad's hat.  
	[laughs]
Bart:	Uh-huh.
North:	And another time, I accidentally stepped in Mr. Wilson's 
	flower bed.  That was a two-part episode.  [laughs]
Bart:	I have to go.

% fascinated by the old-timey napkin dispenser, even though Lisa
% points out it's exactly the same thing as a modern napkin dispenser.
%
% Homer's fascination with the dispenser is interrupted by Wolfguy
% Jack's trademark howl.

Jack:	[howls, then coughs] Aw, man, oh, my throat doctor says 
	I'm not supposed to do that anymore.  Okay, is everybody 
	ready for our nightly dance contest?
Marge:	Dancing!
Homer:	Oh, no, you're not getting me on that dance floor.  Don't 
	try and make me.  [shakes his fist] If I have to get a 
	divorce, I will.
Jack:	Our grand prize tonight is a vintage 1955 Harley-Davidson 
	motorcycle.  [a turntable spins around to reveal a model 
	Fifties garb and a gleaming red motorcycle]
Homer:	Oh!  Oh!  I need a dance partner!  [points at Marge] What 
	about you?
Marge:	Okay, Daddio.
-- He just needed the right incentive, "Take My Wife, Sleaze"

% Wolfguy Jack cues up Johnny Bobby's "Mental House Rock," and the
% dance contestants prepare to twist the night away.  Homer and Marge
% can really cut a rug.  He spins Marge around the dance floor.  Then
% Marge manages to spin Homer in the same way.  Homer again spins
% Marge, this time by the hair.  (Ouch!)  The couple does a running
% backflip off a wall.  Then, Homer tosses Marge so far in the air,
% she flies out the roof, and has to re-enter by the front door.  For
% a finale, Homer spins Marge in place, mussing her hair (and probably
% polishing the floor a little, too).
%
% Wolfguy is mighty impressed.  "I've never seen such reckless

% were a good thing.  Homer and Marge are duly awarded the motorcycle.

% back off.

Jack:	Okay, hep cats, let's twirl some more platters at

	[three days later, he boards up the restaurant]
	Well, that dream is over.  Least we still have each other,

% Homer takes his prize home, where he sits in the front yard, making
% motorcycle noises and pretending to ride.  Bart, promising not to

% Homer reveals the truth:  He doesn't know how to ride.  After

	So I guess you are my hero
	And there's something you should know
	I want to make it clear,

	[Bart on his bike, and Homer on the motorcycle, ride side

	under him, flies through the air, and crashes through the 
	roof of a house.  The two share a laugh]
	If you weren't a man,
	And my father, too,
	I'd buy you a diamond ring,
	And then I'd marry you.

Father:		He's a rebel, I tell you, a rebel without a cause -- 
		just like that boy in that popular movie we saw.
		[Jimmy and his gang ride through a store, raising

Cop:		[arresting Jimmy] When will you teens learn to be 
		uncool like everyone else?
Jimmy:		Never, pops.

Ned:	No.
Moe:	The Christ Punchers.
Ned:	The Christ ... I, I don't think you understand my

Homer:	I'm the president the decision is mine.  We're Hell's

		campgrounds, section K, space 217.  I'm sorry I 
		can't be of more help.
Homer:		I guess I'll never find her.
-- Not unless you get some good leads, "Take My Wife, Sleaze"

% Marge's career makeover course continues.

Marge:		When you get a job interview, try not to call your 
		employer a punk, or a skank.
Meathook:	Makes sense.
Ramrod:		Oh, *don't* call them skanks.
		[Meathook's pencil snaps]
Meathook:	Miss Simpson?  I killed my pencil.
Marge:		Broke.  You "broke" your pencil.
Meathook:	I ... broke him.
Marge:		That's right.  And what else have we learned?
Ramrod:		[raises hand] Ooh, ooh!  That, uh, violence is 
		wrong.
Marge:		Excellent, Ramrod.  Civilized people solve their 
		disputes with words.
-- "Take My Wife, Sleaze"

% Just then, Homer (who must have audited Marge's civilization class)
% bursts out of the bushes and attacks the gang.  The gang leader
% isn't sure what the proper response is to Homer's violent argument,
% and Marge encourages him to talk it out with her husband.  Meathook
% assures Homer that his chapter of the Hell's Satans just wants to
% live in peace -- with Marge.  Homer nixes that idea.

No!  My wife is not a doobie, to be passed around!  I took a sacred 
vow on my wedding day to bogart her forever.
-- Homer Simpson, "Take My Wife, Sleaze"

% Meathook proposes the only civilized alternative, which in this case
% would be a fight in the circle of death.
%
% Homer and Meathook face off in the circle, which has been freshly
% swept by Marge.  As the gang eggs the two on, Homer and Meathook
% fight with chains.  Their chains get tangled up in each other, and
% Meathook hurls the tangled knot out of the circle, narrowly missing
% Marge.  Meathook picks up a big monkey wrench and takes a few swings
% at Homer.  Finally, the Homer resorts the ultimate dueling weapon --
% motorcycles.  Homer picks one up by the back tire and swings it at
% Meathook.  The gang leader picks up a motorcycle of his own. 
% Brandishing the choppers like swords, the two fight their way to the
% top of a stone staircase that conveniently happens to be located in
% the middle of nowhere.  Meathook finally drives Homer to the top of
% the stairs, which is bad for Homer because the next step is a long
% way down.

Meathook:	You know what I'm going to do after I kill you?  
		Take your wallet.
Homer:		Never -- it was a gift from "Newsweek."
-- And a prized family heirloom, "Take My Wife, Sleaze"

% Meathook deftly knock's Homer's bike out of his hands.  Marge tosses
% Homer another motorcycle.  He knocks Meathook back down the stairs
% and demands the return of his woman.  Defeated, Meathook gives her
% up.

Meathook:	I don't blame you for wanting her back so bad.  A 
		woman like that only comes along every couple of 
		miles.
Marge:		Oh ...
Meathook:	Hey!  Can we at least keep her till the orgy at San 
		Berdoo?
Homer:		What do you say, honey?
Marge:		No.
Homer:		[to Meathook, menacingly] No dice.
-- "Take My Wife, Sleaze"

% With the possession of Marge amicably settled, the Hell's Satans say
% goodbye before heading to their jamboree.

Marge:		Goodbye, everybody!
Biker 1:	Goodbye, Mrs. Simpson.
Biker 2:	Goodbye, Mrs. Simpson.
Meathook:	Goodbye, Marge.
Ramrod:		Bye-bye, Mrs. S.
Meathook:	We'll stop at the nearest town and mail our résumés.
Ramrod:		"Résumés" -- it still sounds weird to me.
		[the bikers roar off]
-- "Take My Wife, Sleaze"

% Homer and Marge ride home on Homer's Harley.  He stops off at Poppa
% Wheelie's to take care of some "unfinished business."  Seconds
% later, he dashes out of the bar with a keg of beer.  With Marge
% driving, the two hastily ride back to their good job, loving family,
% and house in the suburbs.
%
% In a rare live-action scene, NRBQ plays their rendition of the
% show's closing theme.

% [End of Act Three.  Time (including live-action ending):  21:02]
