% Television.

Live, from beautiful Malaki Island (``We're not just for lepers any more''),
it's ``Carnival of the Stars''!
-- Troy McClure hosts another stupid television show, ``Mr. Plow''

I'm your host, Troy McClure.  You may remember me from such films as
``The Erotic Adventures of Hercules'' and ``Dial M for Murderousness''!
-- Troy McClure hosts another stupid television show, ``Mr. Plow''

% Homer watches from Moe's Tavern.  Krusty's tiger-taming act runs into some
% unfortunate problems (``Not the face!''), so Bart and Lisa (watching at home)
% switch to that Mexican television program about the guy dressed in a bee
% suit.  Meanwhile, Marge calls and asks Homer to come home, since it is
% starting to snow.  Homer can't see through his windshield it is snowing so
% hard, and cannot stop in time to avoid rear-ending another car.  He gets out
% of the car, the car's air bag inflates, and Homer takes pleasure in the fact
% that the other car is damaged as badly as his own.  Until he realizes that he
% is standing in his own driveway.  He hit Marge's car.
%
% As the tow truck takes the fused cars away, the insurance adjuster completes
% his interview.

Agent: Now, before I give you the check, one more question.  This place
       ``Moe's'' you left just before the accident.  This is a business of
       some kind?
Homer: [thinks]  Don't tell him you were at a bar!  Gasp!  But what else
       is open at night?
       [aloud] It's a pornography store.  I was buying pornography.
       [thinks]  Heh heh heh.  I would'a never thought of that.
-- How not to throw an insurance agent off the scent, ``Mr. Plow''

% Homer hitch-hikes to Crazy Vlaclav's Place of Automobiles and tries a
% sub-mini-compact.

She'll go 300 hectares on a single tank of kerosene.
-- Crazy Vlaclav tries to sell Homer a car, ``Mr. Plow''

% Though Homer has trouble understanding the Cyrillic characters on the
% dashboard.  Next stop, the Springfield Auto Show.

Kids!  If we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free!
-- Homer takes the kids to a car show, ``Mr. Plow''

% Bart plays in the Bonnie and Clyde Death Car, and discovers money hidden
% in the glove compartment.  Lisa observes crash-test video by Fourth Reich
% Motors---and brings the demonstration to an early end when she points out
% the crash test dummies are real people.  Seated next to the Batmobile is...

Homer: Gasp!  Adam West!  [calling] Kids!  Batman!
Lisa:  Dad, that's not the real Batman.
Adam West: Of <course> I'm the real Batman.  [shows a glossy]
       Here's a picture of me with Robin.
Bart:  Who the hell is Robin?
-- Kid today, ``Mr. Plow''

Michelle Pfeiffer?  Ha!  The only true Catwoman is Julie Newmar, Lee
Meriwether, or Eartha Kitt.
-- Adam West muses, ``Mr. Plow''

% The reminiscences continue, and Homer draws the kids away, very slowly.
% And bumps into a Kumatsu Motors snowplough.  Homer imagines what he could use
% it for...

Homer, I've got to sneak these valuable artworks out of the White House,
but I can't get out of the driveway because of these protesters!
-- President George Bush moves out of the White House, ``Mr. Plow''

% Homer imagines plowing through the crowd.  Back in reality, Homer realizes
% he can't afford to buy it, but the salesman tells him he could use the
% plow itself to make money by plowing driveways.

Homer:    Well, I really should discuss this with my wife.
Salesman: [scoffs] Your wife? [cracks an imaginary whip]
Homer:    What, you think I'm going to buy a $20,000 truck just because you
          make that noise?
Salesman: [does it again]  [and again]  [and again]
Homer:    [on his knees]  I'll take it!
-- ``Mr. Plow''

% [End of Act One.  Time: 5:17]
%
% Marge learns of Homer's purchase.

Marge: I can't believe you bought that plow.  We can't afford it!
Homer: If you're going to get mad at me every time I do something stupid,
       then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things!
Marge: Good!
Homer: Fine!  I'll never, ever, ever do another stupid thing.  Good night!
       [angrily turns to leave and walks face-first into the side of the truck]
Marge: [concerned] Oh, Homey.  Didn't that hurt?
Homer: [quietly]  No.
-- I meant to do that, ``Mr. Plow''

% Homer finishes placing advertising flyers on every car in the parking lot,
% only to have them blown away by a gust of wind.  He spots Barney dressed
% in nothing but a baby bonnet and diapers trying to hand out flyers for
% ``Lullabuy$'', a baby store.  He muses, ``Well, at least I can't sink any
% lower.''  His diaper blows away.  Barney runs naked down the street in
% pursuit.  Upon turning the corner, he says, ``Hi, Ma!''
%
% Homer approaches the altar to read from the epistles of Saint Paul, but
% instead takes the opportunity to advertise his snow-plow business.  But
% not for long.
%
% Lisa suggests bying cheap commercial time on channel 92, and points Homer
% at an advertisement for CDs of Captain McAlister singing sea shanties.
% Homer is impressed.
%
% Late at night, Homer settles on the couch with the family to watch the
% commercial---at 3:17 in the morning.

It may be on a lousy channel, but The Simpsons are on TV!
-- Homer proudly introduces his television debut, ``Mr. Plow''

% Then proceeds a cheap commercial starring The Simpsons, selling, not
% candy bars or mini-vans, but Homer's snow-plow commercial.

Homer: [narrating a TV commercial]
       Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snowblowers?
       And the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?
Bart+Lisa: Uh-huh!
-- Homer's TV commercial as... ``Mr. Plow''

Commercial-Homer: Call now and receive a free T-shirt!
Homer: [watching at home, raises a ``Stockdale for VP'' T-shirt]
       He could still surprise ya!
-- but can he hear ya?  ``Mr. Plow''

My prices are so low, you'll think I suffered brain damage!
-- Truth in advertising, in Homer's TV commercial as... ``Mr. Plow''

% Bart asks, ``You <are> fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren't
% you, Mr. Plow?''  Homer answers out of the corner of his mouth, ``Shut
% up, boy.''  The commercial concludes with an incredibly inane jingle.
% Followed by channel 92's test pattern.  Homer waits for the phone to
% ring, then decides ``Ah, the waiting game sucks.  Let's play
% Hungry-Hungry-Hippos!''
%
% Homer plows the Kwik-E-Mart parking lot, just in time for Snake and his
% pal to knock it over.  Homer plows the Springfield Retirement College
% driveway, and the residents express their pleasure that they are no
% longer trapped inside.  Then they return inside.  Principal Skinner
% considers cancelling school due to snow, but Homer plows the way for
% the school bus.  Bart suffers the slings and arrows and snowballs of
% ungrateful classmates.  On the steps of City Hall...

Mr. Plow, for making it possible for people to get where they're going
without resorting to public transportation <or> car-pooling, I give you
the keys to the city.
-- Diamond Joe Quimby, ``Mr. Plow''

% Homer even earns a free beer from Moe in appreciation.  In response to
% Barney's musig, ``I wish I was a hero'', Homer tells him to ``get out
% there and be the best damned Barney you can be.''  Still clad in his
% bonnet and diapers, Barney rushes outside.  (And crashes into something.)
%
% At bedtime, Homer removes his robe, revealing that he is wearing the key
% around his neck.  Marge apologizes for being wrong about buying the truck,
% and asks Homer to wear the ``Mr. Plow'' jacket to bed, ``Just for me.
% For fun.''  Homer does so, gets into bed, and turns off the light.
%
% At 7am, Homer wakes up to falling snow, but is shocked to find that all the
% driveways have already been plowed!  A giant snow-plow cruises down the
% street:  It's Barney ``Plow King'' Gumble.  To stimulate healthy competition,
% Barney takes out a shotgun and takes out the tyres of Homer's truck.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:52]
%
% At Moe's Tavern, the gang watch Barney's ``Plow King'' commercial, in which
% he bashes a cardboard cut-out of Homer with a baseball bat.  He is joined
% by Linda Ronstadt.

Moe:    Linda Ronstadt!  How'd ya get <her>?
Barney: Oh, we've been looking for a project to do together for a while.
-- ``Mr. Plow''

% Linda Ronstadt sings the ``Plow King'' theme song.  Homer is hurt.
% ``How could you, Barney?  After all I've done for you.''  Homer flashes
% back to his high school days.  A handsome Barney Gumble studies for his
% SAT's, with hopes of getting into Harvard.  Homer comes in and offers
% Barney a six-pack.  Barney is worried about tomorrow's test.

I've got two words for you:  Mellow out, man.
-- Homer Simpson, ``Mr. Plow''

% Barney reluctantly takes a sip.  Then the entire can.  And gradually turns
% into the disgusting drunk we all know and l... we all know.
%
% Homer spots Ned and even Adam West letting Barney plow their driveways.
% Adam West hops into his Batmobile, snaps on his shoulder belt, and with
% some effort, manages to get his run-down Batmobile (complete with parachute
% brake) to putter down the street.
%
% Homer anxiously waits for the phone to ring.  And it does.  But it's the
% delinquent accounts department from Kumatsu Motors.

Yeah, they were gay.
-- Homer pretends to be Tony Plow, from ``Leave It to Beaver'', ``Mr. Plow''

% Lisa suggests another commercial, and Homer offers to do a rap.  The kids
% beg Homer never to rap again.
%
% Homer goes to the McMahon and Tate Advertising Agency for help.
%
% The family watch the results.  It's one of those weird almost-black-and-white
% ``artistic'' commercials that make no sense.
%
% Diamond Joe Quimby forcibly removes the key to the city from Homer's hands
% in an attempt to give it to Barney.
%
% Springfield is in the midst of a blizzard.

Kent:  Hardest hit by the blizzard is Springfield's forbidding Widow's Peak.
       Our own Arnie Pie is on the scene.
Arnie: [live remote, in a helicopter]  Everything's snowed in!  All I can see
       is white!
Kent:  [impatiently]  Arnie, please.  The ski conditions.
Arnie: [now upside-down]  Mayday!  Mayday!  I think I'm flying into a mountain!
       Tell my wife I lo... [picture fuzzes out]
Kent:  [chuckles] That's great, Arnie.
-- Weather report, ``Mr. Plow''

% Homer gets an idea.  He calls Barney with a disguised voice asking him to
% plow his driveway atop Widow's Peak.  Barney is in a hot-tub with Linda
% Ronstadt.

Homer:   [on the phone, disguising his voice]
         There's a $10,000 bill in it for you.
Barney:  Oh yeah?  Which president's on it?
Homer:   Uh... All of them.  They're having a party.  Jimmy Carter's
         passed out on the couch.
Barney:  Wow!
-- Don't ask where Jack Kennedy is, ``Mr. Plow''

% Linda Ronstadt offers to make a Spanish version of the Mr. Plow theme.
%
% Homer steals all of Barney's customers.

Woman: Could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt?
Homer: [sotto voce]  Kiss <my> asphalt.
-- ``Mr. Plow''

% News flash:  Barney was caught in an avalanche at Widow's Peak.  The
% shocking event was captured on film by a FOX camera crew filming ``In
% Search of Bigfoot.''  The scene of Bigfoot is ruined when the guy in
% the ape suit forgets to take off his watch before shooting begins.
% Off to the side is Barney studying a map.  He belches, and the sound
% induces the avalanche, burying him.  Homer assumes full responsibility
% and heads out to save his buddy.
%
% At the foot of the mountain, Marge makes one last plea for Homer not to
% go.  Homer assures her, ``This baby is as sure-footed as a mountain goat.''
% In true sitcom fashion, a faraway mountain goat loses its footing and
% descends the mountain the painful way.
%
% To cross a dangerous chasm, Homer braves a dilapidated rope bridge.
% Not until he's halfway across does he notice the sturdy modern bridge
% that runs next to it.
%
% Making its way along a precarious ledge, the truck loses its traction
% and teeters ever-so-precariously over the edge.  Homer carefully turns
% the radio dial towards the upper end of the dial, and this proves enough
% to tip the truck back to safety.
%
% Barney has resigned himself to his fate, but Homer arrives and rescues
% him.  The two are reconciled and agree to become partners.  Homer is
% pleased.  ``When two gbest friends work together, not even God Himself
% can stop them.''  A stern voice challenges, ``Oh no?''  The sun suddenly
% appears, melting the snow.  All of it.

Could this record-breaking heat wave be the result of the dreaded
``Greenhouse Effect''?  Well, if 70-degree days in the middle of winter
are the `price' of car pollution, you'll forgive me if I keep my old Pontiac.
-- Kent Brockman's Two Cents, ``Mr. Plow''

% Homer answers the phone:  It's the Repo Depot, calling to distract him
% while they re-possess his truck.  Which they do.  Marge looks on the
% bright side.  ``You have your health, you have your best friend back,
% and... [coyly] you do have that certain special something...''  She
% means, of course, the Mr. Plow jacket.  Homer fetches the jacket from
% the closet and makes his own weather prediction:  ``The forecast calls
% for flurries of passion, followed by extended periods of gettin' it on.''
% He turns off the light.

I hope everybody got the joke about ``Widow's Peak''.

If anybody says that the rope bridge scene was a reference to an Indiana Jones
movie, I'll scream.

A hectare is a unit of area, not length.

Kumatsu Motors was the company that took over Herb Powell's car company.
