    Maggie falls:
        2 - Walking towards the TV set.
        1 - After changing the channel back. (*)

    (*) This is a particularly funny fall since she very carefully extends
        her foot, only to fall when it misses the floor.

% Bart and Lisa sit at opposite ends of the couch, watching TV.

T: [weird music]  We'll be right back, after this word.

% Bart and Lisa immediately start fighting, cartoon style.  (All you see
% is a cloud of dust out of which assorted body parts briefly appear,
% accompanied by yells of ``Take that!'' and ``Auugh!'')

T: And now...

T: ... back to our show.
