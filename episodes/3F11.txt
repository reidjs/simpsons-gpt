=======================================================================

    Marge's new designer suit (discounted, natch) nets her and
    the family an invitation to the Springfield Country Club,
    where she finds it's a stress to dress to impress.  That's
    also where PGA's Tom Kite praises "natural" golfer Homer,
    who hits the links with Mr. Burns.  Voices: Julie Kavner,
    Tress MacNeille, Harry Shearer, Dan Castellaneta, Yeardley
    Smith.

>> COUCH SCENE

       The couch scene begins in "black light", then Homer turns on

	but with the accents on the last syllable?
    ... when Marge drinks her tea, her pinky is extended?

	last night, she does?
    ... Maggie is wearing a baggie with a collar?
    ... at each hole on the golf course, all of the tees appear to be
	on the same patch of grass and are all white?  (Maybe they're
	supposed to indicate just one teeing area - but then why have
	multiple markers on them?)

    ... the Chanel boutique was open at night?
    ... Burns knows Homer's name now?
    ... Marge either had $3300 in cash or charged $3300 on a credit
	card, neither of which seems possible given the events in past
	episodes?
    ... when Maggie sucks on a french fry, it makes the same sound as
	her pacifier?
    ... not once did anyone mention that Homer would still have to pay
	the (presumably expensive) fees in order to remain in the club?

Jose Lafaurie:
    ... Homer frowns along with the kids when Marge announces they are
	going to Ogdenville for the new TV?
    ... there are phone lines on the unpaved road?
    ... the spilled soda and the piece of paper outside the electronics
	store?
    ... the Carnivale' is not a Chinese TV like their old one?  (cf.
	7F12)
    ... when Lisa says "Just like Mary Hart" you see a cast-off pair of
	pants behind her?
    ... all the lights in the house are on at night, even the garage?
    ... Homer sleeps with his golf cap?
    ... a piece of toilet paper under one of the stalls?
    ... Burns says "schedule" like the British say it?
    ... Burns didn't find out if Homer "Nixon" was any relation like he
	said he would do?
    ... Homer completely disobeyed Marge and shouts "Woo-hoo" even
	before he won?
    ... Smithers runs in front of Burns?  (So he could cheat.)
    ... the balls Smithers used to cheat are not monogrammed with "MB"?
	(Following the rules of golf, the same ball must be played
	throughout the whole game.  Homer could have realized Mr. Burns
	was cheating a long time ago.)

Dominik Halas:
    ... Maggie's walker-thingie in the corner of the TV room?

Adam Monteiro:
    ... after Burns hits the golf ball at the eighth hole, you see it
	veer to the left?

=======================================================================
> Comments and other observations
=======================================================================

>> Opera Sounds Good when You're Vacuuming

Dale G. Abersold says, "The opera La traviata, a snippet of which was 
    played on the episode, is set in 19th century Paris, while the 
    screen showed a couple dressed in what appeared to be 18th century 
    garb.  In addition, "Sempre libera" is an aria for the soprano in 
    an otherwise deserted stage.  Of course, this probably bothered 
    only those of us who are fans both of The Simpsons and opera.  So, 
    three or four of us, world-wide." [five, counting me --ed]

>> The Grey Market (or, "Malk?!")

The joke of the cheap prices of high-prices and near-brand name TVs is
    explained by Benjamin Robinson: "When goods produced abroad are
    sold in the United States, they are usually brought in by a 
    factory-authorized distributor.  However, any distributor, not just
    the official one, can import goods and then resell them.  As it 
    turns out, many of them do just that, passing the savings along to
    the customer.  Although the name "grey market" suggests this is not
    on the up-and-up, it is perfectly legal.  Of course, there's a 
    catch: the factory warranty is available only through the factory 
    distributor.  Still, if you're on a budget and willing to take a
    gamble, the grey market may be for you."

>> Cars in this episode (from Robinson the Groening-mechanic)

Benjamin Robinson says, "Those of us who DON'T have fifteen reasons to
    prefer horses to cars will notice some clever car "casting" in
    this episode.  Marge's new friend drives a Mercedes 300-series
    touring wagon.  (I think the exact model number is 300TD or 300TE.)
    These cars are popular among the country-club set; they have more
    snob appeal than and Olds Vista Cruiser, plus plenty of space for
    antiques and brie.  Notice that the car shown in this episode has
    the aftermarket gold-tint trim.  Some circles, particularly old-
    money circles, consider that rather gauche.

    "Burns' quadricycle defies positive identification, but clearly
    comes from the 1895-1905 time frame.  Period touches include:

     - acetylene headlamps
     - skinny tires
     - bulb horn
     - tiller steering (the steering wheel hadn't been invented yet)
     - leaf spring suspension, with the "leaves" mounted left-right,
       rather than front-back."

>> Grifting (it's not that bad movie with Anjelica Huston?!)

Haynes Lee tells us, "To `grift' is an American corruption of `graft'
    which means to gain an unfair advantage. `Grifting' usually refers
    to cheating at cards or dice. It is very obscure and probably jargon
    that an old coot like Grampa would know about."

>> "Did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap?"

Tony Hill explains, "Kennedy and Lincoln having the same handicap is a
    ref to the Kennedy-Lincoln coincidences, such as Lincoln shot in
    theatre, killer hid in warehouse; Kennedy shot from warehouse,
    killer hid in theatre, etc."

>> Maybe we need a fund for Jewish clowns...

Benjamin Robinson explains Krusty's quote: "In the olden days, country
    clubs certainly were exclusive.  Blacks could not get in.  Neither
    could Jews.  (This is why Krusty wonders if "my kind" is welcome.)
    In fact, anyone who wasn't rich, white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant
    was left standing at the gate.  The clubs dropped these 
    restrictions as bigotry became less fashionable.  Or so they 
    claim."

>> The Spanish in this episode

   Ay, que agoni'a - Ow, the pain!
   Ay, Dios no me ama - Ow, God doesn't love me.
   El dentisto es loco - The dentist is crazy

>> Duh, was it "Inna-Gadda-Da-Vida"?? :-B

   In case you didn't know what the music playing for the trailers of
   this episode was, it's Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik", First
   Movement.  Thanks to Jose Lafaurie for pointing this out.

>> Why Bother Saving Money if You're Wasting It on Gas?

From Tony Hill: "The distance to Ogdensville is a parody on the recent
    U.S. practice of opening outlet malls at some distance from major
    cities so as not to offend manufacturers' customers.  Of late,
    outlet malls have been opening closer and closer to the cities."

>> Correlation between Bumblebee Man and "Chespirito"

As an occasional watcher of "Chespirito", I can testify that there are
    similarities between "Chespirito" and the Bumblebee Man on "The
    Simpsons".  "Chespirito" is a bumbling idiot dressed up in a bug
    costume (red, with a heart on his chest), often chased around
    by police officers and other characters with oversized objects.
    The episode that caught the Chespirito spoof the most was "Mr.
    Plow".  The music, situation, and intonations were dead-on.

>> Where is Springfield? (The Loser Question of the Century)

Tony Hill says, "Japanese internment camps were almost all in 
    California.  But... there are no Dairy Queens in California; and
    obviously Springfield isn't in Vermont or Washington state
    tonight."  I beg to differ though:  I live in Moreno Valley,
    California, and there is a Dairy Queen at the corner of Heacock
    and Alessandro, and another one in the Moreno Valley Mall.
    Look at it if you're around.

Also note that Lisa asked Marge how much her dress was with tax, and
    keep in mind that Oregon doesn't have a sales tax.  Can anyone
    recall where Ogdenville was positioned on Lanley's map in 9F10?

=======================================================================
[opinions on this episode was polarized big-time --ed]

Dale G. Abersold - Any episode centering on Marge is doomed to failure,
    and this one was not an exception; on the other hand, the golf 
    subplot was not bad.  In general, however, this episode seemed like
    it could have been written for any sitcom, with the characters 
    warped to meet the plot, rather than molding the plot to meet the
    characters.  D+/C-.

Erik Berliner - It's good to see the Simpsons returning to the
    character driven stories, There were some great laughs (Burns at
    the gas station, Homer in golf clothes, hicks, etc.), but mostly,
    there was a great picture of OFF realizing who they are, and
    realizing that they are happy with that.  I was truly touched when
    Marge (excellently chracterized) forbids the family to drive to
    the house, and Homer replies that just once, he'd like to be called
    "sir".  The subplot was funny, and added humor and levity to a good
    main story.  My Grade: A-

Ben Cohen - The entire episode, while delivering some singularly funny
    lines, was not The Simpsons that I once knew and loved.  The days
    of subtle humor, deserving and thoghtful references, cutting
    political satire, and revealing social commentary are gone.  Sure,
    it was better than some of this season, but realative to past
    years, this wouldn't be in the top 10%.  I'd give it a D+.

Chris Courtois - "Scenes From the Class Struggle in Springfield" was a
    fairly dull episode.  It didn't suck like the George Bush ep, but
    it didn't have much going for it either. The storyline has been
    done before on many other sitcoms, although the golf subplot had
    some funny moments. Crittenden is finally getting a handle on
    the characters, with the glaring exception of Lisa. Basically a
    few good gags surrounded by an uninspired story and a lot of flat
    gags. D+/C-.

Don Del Grande - It was a fairly straightforward "ordinary folk in
    society" story with a few good laughs, but it just came to a
    crashing halt in the last scene.

Dominik Halas - Another ho-hum episode from Jennifer Crittenden.  There
    weren't any horrible bits, but there was nothing particularly good
    about the episode, either.  The jokes seemed stiff and unoriginal,
    and the ending was too quick and unrealistic.  Grade:  D+.

Jason Hancock - A so-so episode.  I did not care for Marge's crabbiness
    and her demands for perfection.  But I loved Burns' Nixon
    impression, and the golf course scenes were hilarious.  At least
    now we know why OFF isn't an upper-class family.  Grade:  C+; higher
    if the focus was on Homer instead of Marge.

Tony Hill - A muted episode, IMHO.  I know we should be critiquing what
    was aired rather than what we THINK should have been aired, but 
    this one ended with a whimper.  Think of the oodles of things Bart
    and Homer could have done!  (Even Lisa could have screwed it up.)
    Never was a mention of the money.  I know I've complained that some
    eps are too predictible, but this was unpredictible in the wrong
    ways.  C+

Gary Huckabay - Generally, fairly forgettable.  C.  Nice to see Cletus,
    though.  I actually thought that the portrayal of Lisa was very 
    much within character, and admire the efforts of Ms. Crittenden to
    maintain such.  Lisa has her value set, but she has demonstrated an
    affinity/weakness for horses.  Can anyone else not get enough of Mr.
    Burns?

Jose Lafaurie - What a sorry episode!  Once again, Marge's personality
    was pushed to the breaking point of unbelievability.  It's like
    something straight out of junior high; all you want is acceptance?!
    I still can't blame the writers for trying; Marge is a pretty
    complex character.  As for the golf plot, it was pretty unfinished
    and went by too fast.  Didn't like the country club gig one bit.
    Although this whole episode kept me ROTFC (Crying), there were
    a couple of funny parts that made me look up and giggle: Tom Kite's
    unpredictable maliciousness, and Smithers' brain hemorrhage when
    he ate Burns' cake.  GRADE:  D

Norman J. Landis - ... I don't understand all the *really* negative
    reviews so far.  While I wouldn't classify this episode as a great
    one, I certainly had my share of laughs... This was a very
    straightforward episode, with a clear-cut plotline and consistent
    and solid character development.  Marge's desire for something
    "better" and Lisa's head being turned by the opportunity to ride
    horses was completely in keeping with previous character 
    development.  Overall Grade: B.

Haynes Lee - An overdue episode that gives Marge some more 
    characterization. The sub-plot of Homer versus Burns at golf is 
    seamlessly woven in.  B+

Adam Lipkin - I sat motionlessly and watched this one...laughed maybe
    three times tops. This episode just wasn't up to the Simpson
    standard. Not believable, not in character, not funny. C-/D+.

John Martin - Some real good jokes, along with a good split story line
    (Homer vs. Burns on the links, Marge and the snoots).  I didn't
    like the ending until they showed that the Simpsons would have been
    made members.  Great jokes with Apu's "hot dog hot dog" line, Mr.
    Burns' car, both scenes with Tom Kite, and Krusty's line "I knew my
    kind wasn't welcome here."  Overall, a B+.

John Murray - Grade B-.  An Ok episode with a poor plot with some great
    lines, but too few of them.  The general plot was really bad, but
    great lines from Burns, Grandpa and Apu made up for some of it.
    Burns quotes showing how old he was, Burns doing Nixon, Apu's crazy
    motorized pen, and Grandpa "fixing" the TV all had me ROFL.  Also 
    the Krusty scenes were great.

Keith Palmer - This episode suffered from bad characterisation 
    (Jennifer Crittenden should just give up on writing scenes with
    Lisa in them) and an abrupt ending, but contained some fairly
    pleasant gags, and wasn't as bad as it might have been.  Grade: C+

Mark Richey - Ho, hum. Another mediocre episode.  What would have been
    side-splittingly funny two or three years ago just sits there.
    For the first time, I'm really feeling that OFF is going downhill.
    Three years ago, the idea of the Simpsons at a country club would
    have been minted for all comic value possible.  However, except
    for the women's names, they completely dropped the ball.  While
    it's nice to see an episode focusing on Marge, she deserves better.
    Grade: C-

Benjamin Robinson - A comedy of manners that does not quite capitalize
    on its premise.  The final scene was nice, but getting there's a 
    long trip.  (C)

Dan Ryazansky - No, this episode did not have it. If the writers tried
    to make a point with this episode, well, it didn't work.  The whole
    Marge-as-upper-class thing was way out of her character. We didn't
    see Homer or Bart ruining the country club like I thought they 
    would.  No.  Something was missing from this episode. Without Homer
    vs. Burns, this episode would get a D-. With it, it's a C-. A
    generous C-. Nice to see the hicks back, though...

Christine Tiplady - I have to weigh in with the first positive review
    of this episode.  It was all worth it for the quality Lisa-time.
    . . . I liked the episode because I like family-focus vs. high-
    concept.  It was pointed out to me that the ep lacked "guffaws",
    but I prefer the kind of "touching" family-humor [i.e. Lisa jumping
    on the bed].  I don't care much for this type of lame-o happy
    ending, though.

Aaron Varhola - Jennifer Crittenden redeems herself. Marge and Lisa are
    characterized well, as they are affected negatively, becoming more
    selfish by their exposure to "society"; the ending seemed to be a
    cop-out until the acceptance twist. A solid episode. B+.

Yours Truly - I don't hold Crittenden with the same bad esteem as
    others in this newsgroup, but still this episode was a tad mediocre
    for my tastes.  They could have trashed the golf subplot (which
    I, unlike others, didn't like) and added a scene of OFF wrecking
    the country club ball.  Also, Dietter proves herself an incompetent
    director with mounds of animation errors.  I give this one a C+.

AVERAGE GRADE: C+ (2.24)

       it?
Burns: Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add
       savor to my inevitable triumph.
Homer: [pause] Yes.
-- No, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Homer drives the ball up high, and he yells "Woo-hoo!" while it
% flies in the air, but it lands in the sand trap: "D'oh!"  Burns
% adds, "Yes, you're in deep d'oh now."  It's Burns' turn, and
% he hits the ball far.  Smithers remarks "Perfect as always, sir.
% Right on the green."

% Homer tries to get the ball out of the sand trap.

Burns: Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club.
       The sand wedge!
Homer: Mmm... open-faced club sandwich.
-- One-track mind, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Marge hurries back to the Ogdenville Outlet Mall.

% Homer and Burns advance to hole eight.  "You're four strokes behind,
% Simpson," Burns reminds Homer, and proceeds to hit a hook.  But
% Smithers uses binoculars to see the ball get on the green.  Homer
% bats his club on the ground repeatedly in anger, wondering how
% Burns can hit so far, and the club flies away from his hands,
% hitting Krusty (being advised by Tom Kite) in the head.  Kite
% scurries away.

     Marge: Miss? Miss?  Do you have a Chanel suit or any other
	    high quality clothes?
Saleswoman: No, ma'am, but we do have a shipment of slightly burned
	    Sears activewear coming in this afternoon.
     Marge: Oh, I give up.  [walks away]
    Cletus: What time and how burnt?
-- At night, burnt to a crisp, 
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Burns and Homer continue their golf game, and Homer hits one far
% near the hole, against Smithers' head.  Homer and Burns run to his
% aid.

   Burns: Smithers, what are you doing up here?
   Homer: And what are you doing with this ball, and all those other
	  balls?
	   [many anagrammed golf balls pour forth from Smithers'
	  clothes]
Smithers: Uh, there are no other balls, just these, uh, reptile eggs.
	  Step away, they're endangered.
   Homer: [puts one in his mouth]  These aren't reptile eggs.  You've
	  been cheating!  No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball,
	  you put a fresh one on the green.
   Burns: [gasps] Cheating?  For me?  Why, Smithers, that's patently
	  unnecessary.  I'm one of the world's finest golfers.  Why,
	  in all the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a--
	  [realizing] Oh.
-- Megalomania is shot down again,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Smithers would prefer that Homer kept silent so that they could
% sponsor him for membership, but Homer scoffs and says that he
% wouldn't want to be a member anyway.  "But does your wife?," asks
% Burns.  Homer walks away dejected, stepping over Krusty in the
% process.

I knew my kind wasn't welcome here.
-- Krusty at the country club,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% At night, Marge searches one of the posher parts of Springfield
% for a Chanel suit, and stops at the source: Chanel.

% About to leave for the ball, the family observes Marge's new
% dress.  Bart and Lisa both agree that she looks great, and Lisa
% adds, "You can do anything with that sewing machine."  Marge
% retorts, "No I can't, come on, let's go."  Lisa badgers it out of
% Marge that she got it at the Outlet Store at a dollar (fibs, duh)
% before Marge screams "Why do you have to question everything
% I do?"  "You look nice, is all," Lisa says sadly, and walks
% away.

% The car pulls into the country club, and Homer drives up to
% the entrance.

	[Homer drives to the entrance of the country club]
Marge: Homer, what are you doing?
Homer: I'm driving up to the main building.  They got valet parking.
Marge: We can't drive this up there.  They'll see the dent.  They'll
       see the coat hanger antenna.  Stop the car, we're walking.
Homer: But Marge, valets!  Maybe for once, someone will call me "sir"
       without adding, "You're making a scene."
-- Yes, sir, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% But Marge will have none of it.  She pulls the keys out and they
% walk up the hill.

 Homer: I'm going to regale everyone with my anecdote.  You know, the
	one I tried to say on the radio?  Heh, heh.  Who's going to
	"bleep" me this time?
  Bart: I'm going to pose as an Italian count and get some old lady to
	leave me all her money.
  Lisa: I'm going to ask people if they know their servant's last 
	names, or in the case of butlers, their first.
 Marge: No, no, no!  Not tonight!  No vulgarity, no mischief, no
	politics.  Just be good!
	 [an uncomfortable pause]
  Bart: I'm sorry, mom.  I'll behave.
  Lisa: I won't say anything controversial.
 Homer: I just won't say anything, okay, honey?
Maggie: *suck* *suck* *suck* *suck* *suck*
	 [Marge glares at her]
	[silence]
-- Silence of the Laughs,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Marge huffs off to the main building.

You kids should thank your mother.  Now that she's a better person,
we can see how awful we really are.
-- Homer at the country club,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Marge hears this and her heart unhardens.  She runs back to the
% family and takes Maggie in her arms.

Marge: Homey, I like your in-your-face humanity.  I like the way
       Lisa speaks her mind.  I like Bart's--
	[Bart smiles, but it fades]
       I like _Bart_.
	[Bart smiles again]
-- I like your sheets, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% "And I like my old green dress."  Marge lets it out that she spent
% her savings on this gown.  But don't worry, she has the receipt
% (good for credit in Chanel).  Homer wonders if there's any beer and 
% gum there.

Let's go.  I wouldn't want to join any club that would have _this_
me as a member.
-- Marge waxes philosophical,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

    Lisa: It's okay.  Those snobs would have never made us members,
	  anyway.
	   [at the ball, a huge gala had been set up for OFF]
  Evelyn: Well, I wonder where Marge could be?  She's missing her
	  own initiation.
   Susan: I hope she didn't take my attempt to destroy her too 
	  seriously. [slurps her drink loudly]
   Burns: Where's Homer?  Oh, and to think I spent all afternoon
	  baking him this cake.
	   [a pink messy cake reading "Welcome Homer"]
Smithers: Mmm... [tastes the cake] Ugh!
   Burns: I pickled the figs myself.
-- Looks deceive, "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% Meanwhile, the family is at Krusty Burger, alone, while the acne-
% faced boy mops the floor.

  Boy: [mopping] Hey, did you guys just come from the prom?
 Bart: Sort of.
Marge: But, you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place
       like this.
  Boy: [nods, then realizes] Man, you're crazy.  This place is a dump!
-- If only they knew about the secret sauce,
     "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield"

% The boy continues mopping, muttering to himself, while an overhead
% shot of the Simpsons at their table closes the episode.
