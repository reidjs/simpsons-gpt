Blackboard :- `I will not carve gods'.
              `I will not carve go' at cutoff.

Lisa's solo:- upbeat with a funky rhythm.

Driveway   :- Homer says `D'oh!' when Lisa scoots past.
              Homer says `Waugh!' when the car closes in on him.

Couch      :- The family leap onto the couch and bounce on the
              springs.  At each bounce, the relative position of the
              family members changes.

    ... Sting voiced himself?  Other guest voices were
        Pamela Hayden (Martin), Russi Taylor, and Maggie Roswell.
    ... Maggie fell only once?  (When the townspeople rush past with shovels.)
        Though she did crawl to the door, suggesting that there was an
        unseen fall shortly before.
    ... the freezer was in SERIOUS need of defrosting?
    ... Jimbo sticks his head into the camera frame and waves during
        Kent Brockman's live report?
    ... Chief Wiggum consistently wore his badge on the wrong side of
        his chest?
    ... one of the policemen looks like Wiggum's son!
    ... Maggie was playing with the foil after the prayer?
    ... in the interview with Krusty the Klown, they kept cutting
        back to Kent Brockman for a shot of an attentive nod? {thf}
    ... Sideshow Mel's headset goes INTO his hair?
    ... McBain wore his gun to the recording session? {jrd}
        And was `Sing sing sing' a reference to Sing-sing prison?
    ... people were wearing little well-hats?  Merchandising strikes again.
    ... the oil spot in the driveway is back?
    ... Marge's hair is a bit askew once Bart's well crisis begins?
    ... the acorn by the Lincoln squirrel's head?  (I.e., a top hat.)

Dave Hall {dh}:
    ... Homer was eating while Bart opened his gifts?  Nelson was slurping
        on a drink.
    ... Bart placed a ``Property of Bart Simpson'' label on the kitchen
        ceiling and the Play/Rec. room floor?  (Bart's labels are gone from
        the kitchen throughout the rest of the episode.)
    ... the freezer contained nothing but ice cream?  (The freezer
        even has a light.  Compare the fridge light, which has burnt out.)
    ... Homer threw a loaded rifle to the floor to grab at Bart's throat?
    ... the pacifier hook on Maggie's crib?
    ... the dinosaur skeleton was nearest the surface, followd by the
        treasure chest, then the flying saucer?  You'd think the dinosaur
        would be buried the deepest...

> Rave Reviews
===============================================================================

John R. Donald {jrd}: I give it an A.

Ric Dube (dube@milton.u.washington.edu):  This was just about my favorite
episode since Bart The Daredevil.  Or Flaming Moe's.

Jamie Ide {ji}:  I thought it was a classic!  One of my favorites, anyway.

Shane P. Faulkner {spf}:  A great episode, Bart was at his devious best in
this one.

Ted Frank {thf}:  All-in-all, a good episode.  Homer tackled his second
rock star, and we got to see Sideshow Mel and the Capital City Goofball.

Eric Jablow {ej}:  I didn't like the episode much, although I&S were great,
and the playground scene with Lisa and the jump-ropers was superb.  Notice
the really fast turnaround time from the I&S animators?

Marc Colten {mc}:  Really a terrific episode.

Lawrence A. Schwimmer {las}:  Overall, a fully-packed episode!  I'm amazed
they managed to stuff so many things in (I&S, McBain, guest voice, Krusty,
TV commercial snaring Homer, media events, etc...)

Alan J. Rosenthal {ajr}:  A great one!  Sting was kind of bizarre; it's
funny how unkind they are to guest stars!  The measuring of Bart's height
was probably the best part.

Scott Amspoker {sa}:  [A great episode!]  Absolutely!

Yours truly {rjc}:  Lots of little laughs.  Bart's ``Uh huh'' while Homer's
hands are still around his throat.  ``He fell down a well, and...  he
can't get out.''  Not a classic, but still a strong showing.

===============================================================================
> Animation and continuity goofs
===============================================================================
Homer was standing in the doorway between the TV room and kitchen while
Bart was watching TV, but when Marge stuck her head into the TV room, the
kitchen disappeared and was replaced by a hallway.  Also, the telephone
cord would have to be really extra long to reach from the wall next to the
fridge all the way to the TV room entrance. {dh}

The lip sync during Homer's speech in bed was way off because the
animation was stolen from `Saturdays of Thunder' [8f07].  The scene where
the two cops tell Homer and Marge about Bart's fate might have been taken
from `Bart vs. Thanksgiving' [7f07].

When Bart opens his gift from Patty and Selma, there's an ashtray in front
of them.  But when Homer gives Bart the microphone gift, the ashtray is
gone.

When Homer opens the freezer door, we see three rectangular boxes of ice
cream.  But Homer only inspects two boxes before he quits.  Moreover, the
side angle of the freezer shows cylindrical cartons of ice cream!  (Though
I did like how Homer muttered, ``Mmm... Chocolate'' three times.)

Bart raised his desk lid, which has nothing on it, to hide/throw the
micro-phone in, yet in the next scene, the top of his desk appears to be
full of stuff. {dh}

Rod and Todd's radio antenna appears to change positions. {dh}

Both door mats are missing from the front door as Homer asked `What's up?' {dh}

The stump that Bart looped the rope around appears and disappears from
scene to scene. {dh}

The I&S cartoon is interrupted by a special report from Channel 6 News,
where Kent Brockman gives the report.  Except that in `Krusty Gets Busted'
[7g12], Kent says that the Krusty the Klown show is on a rival network.

In the establishing shot of Homer bringing stuff to the well, he brings a
baseball bat.  But when we move in closer, the bat is missing.  Not a
goof:  In the same shot, Quimby appears to be to the left of his security
guards, but is between them when he tells the cops to take Homer away.
This isn't a goof because he's actually standing in front of them; he
merely seems to be to their left because of the camera angle.

And, of course, a real radio microphone doesn't have the range that Bart's
did.  Dave Hall asks what brand of batteries Bart's radio used.  Sure lasted
a long, long time.

Dave Hall points out that Bart <did> use a fake ID.  In ``Bart vs.
Thanksgiving'' [7f07].

Groundskeeper Willy opened his flask, threw away the cap, downed a drink,
then placed the (uncapped) flask back into his pocket. {dh}

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> References

>>> J. P. Patches

Bill Baker {wab} explains this inside joke.  His story is so well-told that
I include it in its entirety:

J.P. Patches was a clown character played by Chris Wiedes who had a morning
kids show (much like the Krusty the Klown Show) on Channel 7 in Seattle.
He even had a daily shtick where he would look through his ICU2 TV set to
divine the names of kids who were having birthdays that day (he didn't
charge $8).  J.P. was <the> beloved figure to a generation of Seattle
kiddies....

The parallels get really weird if you remember Bart's disillusionment with
Krusty this season.  One of the things Krusty does off camera is smoke.
Well, my dad used to work at Channel 7 and share an office with Chris
Wiedes.  One day my Dad brings me in early to hang around the set while
they're shooting the show.  He drops me off in the cafeteria with (Yes!) the
idol of my youth, J.P. Patches.  Up close in person, I see that J.P. is an
old, tired guy in makeup and a mop wig slumped over a cup of coffee.  He
gives me a desultory hello and then pulls out a coffin nail (J.P. Patches
keeps cigarettes in his pockets?) and lights up.  There went the last of my
childhood innocence.  Then I sat through the show and discovered, through
the off-camera banter, that a lot of the seemingly innocent running jokes
and shtick, the catch phrases repeated by thousands of Seattle tykes, were
actually very adult inside jokes.  Oh well.

The more that I think about it, the more parallels I see between J.P. and
Krusty.  J.P. had a number of sidekicks like Sideshow Bob and Corporal
Punishment, and he played a lot of cartoons.  Of course, this is a
much-copied formula.

However, I did get a great picture of me at 14, long hair down past my
shoulders, with J.P. Patches standing with his arm around me.

>>> Jessica McClure

Some years ago [can anyone give a year?] a young girl named Jessica McClure
fell down a well, the aperture of which was too narrow for a grown-up to
fit down.  She became the focus of media attention for several days until
her rescue, upon which she immediately faded into obscurity.

Garry Shandling also spoofed this news item on his program.  Garry `fell'
down a well, hoping that the media attention would boost his show's ratings.

>>> Chuck E. Cheez

Chuck E. Cheez is a combination pizzeria/kiddie entertainment center on
the West Coast (though outlets have allegedly been spotted on the East
Coast and abroad).  It is a popular site for kiddie birthday parties.  The
similarities with Wall E. Weasel were unmistakeable.

    - the guy costumed as the mascot
    - the cage full of plastic balls (for the youngsters to frolic in)
    - Skee-Ball alleys
    - video games (relatively feeble ones)
    - the birthday party
    - the animated mechanical singers
    - kids running amok
    - the mediocre pizza  [Okay okay, maybe not the mediocre pizza. --rjc]

>> Stupid Springfieldians

Rolf Wilson {rw} complained that it never dawned on the townspeople to
send down somebody skinny (not necessarily a policeman), or to start
digging (until Homer did).  Nor did anybody shine a flashlight down the
well.

Of course, I think that was the whole point.  Everybody in Springfield is
a boob.  Only in Springfield (or perhaps Dick Loudon's Vermont town of
Norwich) could Bart fool everyone for so long.

>> The TV commercial

One of `The Simpsons' strong points is their relentless lampooning of the
less admirable aspects of modern television.

John R. Donald {jrd}:  I love the detail.  Through the window, kids are
throwing a ball around.  When the TV `magically' disappears and the radio
toy-thing reappears in its place, the kids have suddenly stopped throwing
the ball, and are in slightly different positions.  It would have been
easier, from the standpoint of the cartoonist, to simply continue the
action in the background, but in order to imitate the cheesy commercial,
the continuity is purposefully messed up.

Jamie Ide {ji} identifies the song as ``Convoy'' by C. W. McCall.

Ron Carter {rc}:  Part of the commercial is a direct lift from Ronco's Mr.
Microphone ads ``Hey honey, we'll come back later...''  And Homer's
response ``That guy is in for some lovin' later...'' is hilarious...

Yours Truly {rjc}:  My favorite part was the first line.  ``Why sit in
front of the TV, when you can be...''  Playing volleyball outside with
your friends getting some fresh air?  No!  ``... on the radio!''

>> Itchy and Scratchy

(Most of this section will be deleted when J. D. Baldwin incorporates it
into his I&S Guide.)

>>> Cat Splat Fever

Scratchy comes into the bedroom (which contains two beds, one with `Itchy'
on the headrest, the other with `Scratchy') and finds a note: ``Good bye
cruel world.  Itchy.''  Scratchy looks out the window and sees Itchy
calmly hop into the well outside.  Scratchy rushes outside and leaps into
the well to save his friend.

As he falls, Scratchy passes by Itchy, sitting calmly on a brick that
happens to be jutting out from the wall of the well.  Itchy waves bye-bye
as Scratchy falls past.  Scratchy screams and flails his arms, landing in
the open mouth of a waiting alligator.  After a few chomps, the alligator
swallows Scratchy and submerges.  The water turns red.

A Scratchy-angel rises from the water, but as it passes Itchy, the mouse
pulls a gun and fires at the cat's head, blowing a hole clean through his
left eye.  Scratchy's halo rises upward out of shot, but the rest of
Scratchy falls with a scream.  Itchy waves good-bye.

After the cartoon, a panel containing Itchy and Scratchy's heads
bracketing a yellow ribbon appears on the screen, captioned, ``Dedicated
to Timmy O'Toole.''

>>> Didja notice...
    ... the picture of Itchy and Scratchy on the wall?
    ... the alligator chomped Scratchy four times instead of just
        swallowing him whole, as is traditional for cartoons?
        Itchy and Scratchy, at the forefront of cartoon violence. {thf}

>> The jumprope rhyme

One plus one plus three is five.
Little Bart Simpson's buried alive!
He's so neat, he's so sweet.
Now the rats have Bart to eat!

How many days until Bart croaks?  One, two, three, four, ...

>> Miscellaneous

For those who didn't know, in the early days of coal mining, canaries were
placed in the mines as a sort of early-warning system.  Being much smaller
than humans, they were more sensitive to the presence of poison gas.  (Note
also the reference to a song by The Police.)

% grip, and it falls to the bottom.  Groundskeeper Willie hears a plaintive
% ``Help!  Help!'' coming from the well.  He takes a swig from his liquor
% flask and runs through traffic, returning with his plow.  Bart
% chuckles, ``Sucker!''
%
% Word travels quickly through town, and before you know it, the well
% is surrounded by the police, curious onlookers, and Kent Brockman.
% Bart identifies himself as Timmy O'Toole, an orphan who was turned
% away from Springfield Elementary by Principal Skinner on account of
% his shabby clothes.  Skinner denies this accusation.

The circumference of the well is 34 inches, so, unfortunately, not
one member of our city's police force is slender enough to rescue the
boy.
-- Kent Brockman's report, ``Radio Bart''

% (During Kent's report, we see Eddie bring a box of donuts from the
% food stand.  The other cops are already munching away.)  Chief
% Wiggum scolds his men, and when asked why <he> doesn't go down,
% he says, ``Well, I'm too... important.''
%
% Kent explains that Timmy's foot is caught under a rock, so they
% can't simply pull him up, lest he become injured.
%
% A falconer explains that his bird will fly the boy to safety.
% He releases the bird, which flies away, never to return.
%
% A man shows a fishhook and a bar of chocolate.  ``And then I'll
% clean him for free.''

Although we can't reach the boy, we <can> freeze him with liquid
nitrogen, so that future generations can rescue him.
-- Dr. John Fink's plan to rescue poor Timmy O'Toole, ``Radio Bart''

% The Simpsons sit on the TV couch, metal trays set up in front of them.

Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from Your bounty...
-- Marge's TV dinner prayer, ``Radio Bart''

% Marge asks the Lord to keep an eye on poor Timmy, and Bart laughs.

Homer: That Timmy is a real hero!
Lisa:  How do you mean, Dad?
Homer: Well, he fell down a well, and... he can't get out.
Lisa:  How does that make him a hero?
Homer: Well, that's more than you did!
-- ``Radio Bart''

% On TV...

Channel 6's own Krusty the Klown has gathered members of the entertainment
community, who normally steer clear of fashionable causes...
-- Kent Brockman's news report, ``Radio Bart''

% Kent Brockman interviews Krusty regarding his new project, a video
% called We're Sending Our Love Down the Well.

I called my good friend Sting.  He said, ``Krusty, when do you need me?''
I said, ``Thursday.''  He said, ``I'm busy Thursday.''
I said, ``What about Friday?''  He said, ``Friday's worse than Thursday.''
Then <he> said, ``How about Saturday?''  I said, ``Fine.''  True story!
-- Krusty makes his music video, ``Radio Bart''

% Kent interviews Sting and Krusty, then we see the resulting video.

Sting:  There's a hole in my heart as deep as a well for that poor little boy,
        who's stuck halfway to Hell...
Sideshow Mel: Though we can't get him out, we'll do the next best thing...
McBane: We go on TV and sing, sing, sing!
All:    And we're sending our love down the well...
Krusty: All the way down!
All:    We're sending our love down the well...
Krusty: Down that well!
-- Krusty's music video, ``Radio Bart''

% Kent asks Krusty what he's going to do with the royalties.  Krusty explains
% that first, they have to pay for promotion, shipping, distribution, the
% limos they rented...  Whatever's left over, they throw down the well.
%
% The field around the well has turned into a Timmy O'Toole amusement park.
%
% Lisa watches another ridiculously violent Itchy and Scratch cartoon,
% this one with a well theme, and dedicated to Timmy O'Toole.  Meanwhile,
% SLH has gotten his hands, er, mouth on Bart's microphone, and growls
% emerge from the well.  The cartoon is interrupted for a special report,
% and Kent asks Dr. Marvin Monroe for an explanation.  Monroe explains that
% the child is returning to a feral stage.  He shows an artists's conception,
% which looks like a young wolfman.  Lisa sees Bart struggling to
% recover the microphone and puts two and two together.  Bart finally gets
% the mike and explains (in his Timmy voice) that he was trying to chew his
% foot off, then pretends to go to sleep.  Lisa tells Bart that when the
% townspeople realize that it was a hoax, they're going to want to kill him.
% Bart asks how they'll find out.  Lisa says, ``I bet you were stupid enough
% to have left a `Property of Bart Simpson' label on that radio.''  We take
% a wild ride through Springfield, down the well, and focus on the label
% Lisa described.  (Bart:  ``D'oh!'')
%
% That evening, the two cops read the Cinderella story down the well for
% Timmy, then go for a coffee break.  While they're gone, Bart ties a rope
% to a tree stump and rappels down the well.  (He's wearing a flashlight
% taped to his lucky red hat so he can see where he's going.)  The cops
% return, and Eddie says, ``Hey, I almost tripped over this thing,'' and
% unhooks the rope from the stump.  Bart screams as he falls...
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:27]
%
% Bart lands with a thud at the bottom of the well.  Poetically enough, his
% foot is trapped under a rock.  (``What did I do to deserve this?'')
% Bart yells for help and admits to his practical joke.  The cops decide
% to pull their own prank:  They leave.
%
% The two cops tell Homer and Marge that Bart is trapped down the well.
%
% Homer and Marge pay a visit to the well, which has drawn a small crowd.

Don't worry, son.  Just 'cuz you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you
can't live a rich and full life.
-- Homer's reassuring words, ``Radio Bart''

% Homer tosses down Bart's Krusty doll, which lands on Bart's head.  Bart
% complains, ``Ow!  Knock it off, you bald boob!''  Homer threatens, ``Hey,
% don't make me come down there!''
%
% Chief Wiggum says they've located a piece of machinery in Shreveport,
% Louisiana, but there's no room in the budget to bring it to Springfield.

Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well.  If he'd done it
at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo.
-- Chief Wiggum tells Marge it's all in the timing, ``Radio Bart''

% Kent interviews Homer and Marge...

Kent:  The time has come for finger-pointing, and most of them are
       squarely aimed at the boy's parents.
Homer: It's not our fault!  We didn't want the boy, he was an accident!
Marge: Homer!
Homer: Uh...  Could you edit that last part out?
Kent:  Mr. Simpson, we're live, coast-to-coast.
Homer: D'oh!
-- `Radio Bart''

% The next morning, girls have already made up a jumprope rhyme about Bart.
% Lisa tells them to stop, and they do.  But once she's gone, they continue.

And our <new> number one hit, ``I Do Believe We're Naked'', by
Funky-See Funky-Do, replaces ``We're Sending Our Love Down the Well'',
which plunges all the way down to number 97.
-- Casey Kasem's countdown, ``Radio Bart''

% At a press conference...

Ever since I called for the rescue of that Simpson lad, I have taken a lot
of heat.  So, I am flip-flopping!  I say, let him stay down there!
-- Mayor Diamond Joe Quimby, bending ever so gently, ``Radio Bart''

% Roving Reporter Dave Shutton composes his story, ``Town to Well Boy:
% No more free food''.  He gets a hot lead and speeds off.  The Springfield
% Shopper headline reads, ``Squirrel resembling Abraham Lincoln found.''
%
% Marge and Homer pay a late-night visit to the well.

Marge: Bart honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're
       down in the well.  [tosses it]
Bart:  Mom, it's too big.
Homer: Don't worry, you'll grow into it.
-- Bart is trapped in a well, ``Radio Bart''

You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years.
I guess now I'm paying the price.  But there's so many things
I'll never get a chance to do.  Smoke a cigarette, use a fake ID,
shave a swear word in my hair... [sobs]
-- Bart's remorse, ``Radio Bart''

% Homer has had enough and grabs a shovel to start digging; Marge fetches
% a wheelbarrow.  Groundskeeper Willie says to himself, ``Now why didn't I
% think of that?'' and tears off his shirt, revealing an impressive physique.
% He joins Homer with a shovel.  A man appears out of nowhere with a pick-axe.
%
% Kent Brockman interrupts with a special bulletin:  The Lincoln Squirrel
% has been assassinated!
%
% Pretty soon, the entire town has joined the digging effort.  Apu discovers
% a dead canary, and everybody rushes out in panic.  Dr. Hibbert concludes
% that the canary died of natural causes, and everybody goes back.
%
% Sting continues shoveling...

Marge: Sting, you look tired.  Maybe you should take a rest.
Sting: Not while one of my fans needs me.
Marge: Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums.
Homer: Shhhh.  Marge, he's a good digger!
-- Digging Bart out of a well, ``Radio Bart''

% Once Sting breaks through, Homer and Marge push him out of the way so they
% can check on Bart.  Homer tells Bart, ``Don't worry, son.  They're going
% to make sure no one ever falls down this well again.''  After the field
% is restored to its former glory, Groundskeeper Willy hammers into the ground
% about thirty feet from the well a small sign that reads simply, ``Caution:
% Well.''  ``Thaht should dew it.''
