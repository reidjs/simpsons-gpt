Blackboard:     I WILL NOT SCARE THE VICE PRESIDENT

                I WILL NOT SCARE THE VI              at cutoff

Couch:          The family rides into the living room in bumper cars.  Marge
                (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa all converge on Homer, bumping
                him into the back wall.  [Recycled from BABF10]

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... Lisa's Malibu Stacey doll has a Pepperdine notebook?

Matthew Anscher:
   ... the show's lack of any time-space continuum has put Homer and Barney in
       high school in 1976 (the year the song "Kung Fu Fighting" came out)?
   ... Francine looks a little bit like Krusty the Clown's daughter Sophie?
   ... this is the first time Martin Prince has had a major line in a long
       time?
   ... Apu and Manjula didn't take offense at the novelty gloves slipped on
       Shiva's hands?
   ... this is the second time this season that one of Homer's "solutions" has
       caused mass unemployment?
   ... Lisa's theory didn't explain why bullies preyed on non-nerds, such as
       Bart?

Don Del Grande:
   ... when Nelson had a talk with Lisa, he had his arm around her?
   ... Dr. Hibbert's wife had a recent baby?
   ... two urban legends were mentioned: "Pi is exactly 3" and "cats suffocate
       babies"?

Eva Ghitelman:
   ... Francine's parents are nerds?

Joe Green:
   ... the bus's gearshift knob looks like an 8-ball?

Darrel Jones:
   ... Ralph's idea of a "new kid" really is a kid (baby goat)?
   ... Smithers wore braces in high school?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the hippie flowers when the scene shifts from the present to the
       1970's?
   ... the school gymnasium is now named after Dr. Marvin Monroe?

Haynes Lee:
   ... Otto has a green novelty foot on the school bus accelerator?
   ... Nelson's octopus mangling Willy, Skinner and Krabappel?
   ... shadow outlining Maggie's back?
   ... Wendell finally puked after a long absence?
   ... yuppie thrown out of car has a cell phone?

Alie Molino:
   ... Marge gets a sock stuck in her hair while trying to get Bart and Lisa
       ready for school?
   ... the kid with the headgear on the bus has a "Frankie Say: Relax" T-
       shirt?
   ... the baby safety saleswoman has an unnaturally large head?  (And,
       according to Homer, an unnaturally large "caboose" as well.)
   ... despite being branded a loser in high school himself, Homer bullied
       Smithers?
   ... the end of Wendell's vomit, around his mouth, is gray?
   ... Willie's videotaping fetish may be encouraged (or assuaged) by the
       cameras at Springfield Elementary?

Mike Reed:
   ... this is the second John Frink/Don Payne-written episode to feature an
       NRBQ song?
   ... this is the first time since season 8 we've seen an Itchy & Scratchy
       short at least twice in one season?
   ... Homer knows offhand the Poison Deliver phone number?
   ... not only did Francine not beat up Lisa at the pool, but she waved to
       her?
   ... Skinner and Krabapple make no attempt to stop Nelson from beating up on
       Tatum?  ["Why bother?" asks Nathan DeHoff, "It's not like Tatum was
       getting hurt."]

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Marge's fists shake a little when she declares that she won her "race"
       with Otto?
   ... as the baby-proofer smacks the bottle on the floor, she once hits her
       own hand?
   ... someone remembered to animate Milhouse putting his pills away, rather
       than just having them disappear?  Nice attention to detail!
   ... one of the scientists in the audience at the Big Science Thing says
       that Lisa is still in the "larval stage"?
   ... someone repeats "let's not listen to her" even after Lisa successfully
       demonstrates her theory?
   ... Lisa doesn't laugh as Francine beats up the scientists?  (Well, neither
       does Maggie, but that's expected.)

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Steve Alpert:  I think that the staff still needs to find good endings, but at
   least the beginning was good.  I was laughing several times throughout, and
   although this episode wasn't as strong as last week, it certainly was by no
   means a poor episode.  The bully needed a girl voice though. Has Maggie
   Roswell been put on steroids?  [Maybe, maybe not.  The voice was done by
   Kathy Griffin, though -- Ed.] Would've been a B+, but because of the bad
   voice, it gets a  (B-)

Don Del Grande:  The only king that kept this episode from going nowhere was
   that the long ending sent it into a downward spiral.  At least the subplot
   had the occasional good gag, but it got buried much too early.  (B-)

Joe Green:  In spite of a few farfetched plot elements, this episode was very
   consistent and funny.  "The Simpsons" has, IMHO, made a gradual creative
   comeback over the course of Season 12, and this show was another good sign.
   (A-)

Darrel Jones:  An excellent wacky episode, IMO.  Some won't care for the
   wackiness, or Homer getting pierced by the nail gun, but I loved Francine.
   Homer's "Hurt your children!" rampage was hilarious, too.  Earns an A-
   (8/10) for effort.  (A-)

Chad Lehman:  Very surprised.  Just a little expository dialogue.  Very, very
   cool!  Best of Season 12.  It doesn't have the emotional depth of say,
   8F06.  But it was very cool.  Possibly my first "A" grades since season 9.
   (A)

Alie Molino:  Wow!  Two, two, two plots in one! ... which hasn't happened for
   a couple of episodes.  Homer's Baby Safety campaign and Lisa's
   Anti-Aggression study got pretty equal airtime.  However, Homer's baby
   safety campaign was not wrapped up quite neatly.  This episode had a lot to
   say, and is disguised as a moral message episode, but doesn't quite end up
   as one.  What are we to learn from this week's episode?  Spray ourselves
   with salad dressing?  Wrap ourselves in bubble wrap?  (However, what you do
   on your own time is none of my business).  Lots of twists and turns, a nice
   smattering of laughs, but not one of my favorites this season ...  (B-)

Michael Nusair:  Ahhhh, another episode that was good -- but not great.  There
   were quite a few funny parts, and the plot was good.  The nail-gun scene
   probably went on a bit too long, though.  Also, it was strange to see one
   of Homer's schemes actually be successful.  But I guess he needs an income
   of some sort, now that he obviously doesn't work at SNPP anymore. Anyway,
   this episode certainly wasn't a classic, but it was entertaining, funny,
   and had a pretty good plot.  You can't ask for too much more than that
   these days.  (B)

Mike Reed:  I don't know what to think, frankly.  It had a few good laughs,
   but, aside from the I&S short at the beginning, nothing really stands out
   in my mind.  It was nice to see Database and Drederick Tatum again, but
   overall, I'd rate this episode a little forgettable.  (B-)

Kelly Stewart:  I thought this started as an incredibly funny episode with
   some great lines.  I liked the opening sequence with Itchy and Scratchy
   cereal, "your baby is dead!" (tasteless and classic), and one of Ralph's
   all time great lines ("We're a totem pole hu-ya hu-ya") ... LOL.  But what
   the hell happened after the midpoint of this show?  it's like a new set of
   writers came in and botched it.  Homer as a safety freak?  Nerd sweat?  The
   second half of this episode was so bad I wanted to cringe.  (B-)

Todd Willis:  Damn, this was a pretty good episode despite the fact that a
   similar plot had already been done twice.  The first two acts were gold and
   reminded me of me of some of the older episodes.  The third act brought the
   show down with the whole "Nerd Sweat" thing, but the writers still did a
   decent job of keeping the third act funny.  (B+)

Fox Wolf:  I really don't know what to think about this episode.  The first
   act was all around great, the second act was also very good, but it's the
   "nerd sweat" thing that just killed the episode.  It was so good and had so
   much potential, but then that entire thing ... well, the two great acts do
   very much overpower the third, but I still can't get that bad third act
   aftertaste out of my mouth.  (B+)

Yours Truly:  It's a Lisa-centric episode, yet Lisa's subplot is strangely
   uncompelling.  The premise -- Lisa must deal with the new school bully --
   isn't bad, but Francine the bully is too generic.  She just shows up, beats
   on Lisa, and moves along, often without saying a word.  It robs some energy
   from the plot because both sides of a "good girl vs. evil girl" conflict
   have to be interesting.  We also have the usual problem an ending which
   leaves too many things unexplored.  On the other hand, I did like a subplot
   revolving around Homer's baby-proofing crusade.  (The scene where a
   professional tries to open a supposedly easy-open bottle is hilarious.)  I
   give it a C+, albeit a fairly strong one.  (C+)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B (2.99)   Std Dev.: 0.5410   (14 reviews computed)

>> Those Eternal Threads

 - Where is Springfield?

Gerard Motola:  Tonight's Simpsons featured the LA "river" [the aqueducts
   Marge and Otto raced through] ...


Handsome Pete:  That's what I thought for a long time.  Mountains, desert,
   ocean, all kinds of weird characters plus KrustyLu studios.  But this is
   contradicted by that episode when "Hollywood" came to Springfield to make
   the Radioactive Man movie.  Hmmph.


Paul Tomko disagrees:  All large cities have these drainage canals, though
   some are in underground tunnels.


>> Musical References

Alie Molino:  While Marge is trying to get the kids ready for school, "Sword
   Dance" plays?


Joe Green:  "Kung Fu Fighting" by Carl Douglas -- Homer sings this while
   beating up Smithers.

   "Safety Dance" by Men Without Hats -- Homer sings this after hearing
   himself mentioned on TV.


Craig "King" Pineapple:  "Always Safety First" by NRBQ plays during Homer's
   baby-proofing montage.


>> Meta-Reference Corner

Joe Klemm:  Francine's attack towards the screen at the end may be targeted
   toward us Simpsons fans who post their comments on the Internet.


>> Folklore Alert

Haynes Lee presents:  Cats suck the breath from babies, sometimes killing
   them.  Proven false. <http://www.snopes2.com/critters/wild/catsuck.htm>

   Alabama redefined the value of pi to 3 to bring it in line with Biblical
   precepts.  Alabama's state legislature redefined the value of pi from
   3.14159 to 3.  Proven false. <http://www.snopes2.com/religion/pi.htm>

   T. Indiana House Bill #246 of 1897 is a piece of gibberish that could be
   interpreted to mean pi = 3.2, 4, or 160/49. Killed in state Senate.  This
   is true.

   Some state (e.g., KS, OK, etc.) once considered a bill setting pi = 3 (or
   some other arbitrary, non-transcendental number).  False, although with
   some elements of truth. <http://www.urbanlegends.com/legal/pi_indiana.html>


>> But if he goes, who will run the country?

Benjamin Robinson writes:  Recently elected Vice President Dick Cheney has
   been in the news a lot lately, but not in a good way.  The new veep has a
   history of heart problems dating back to when he was in his thirties, and
   shortly before this episode aired in the U. S., Cheney was briefly
   hospitalized for chest pains.  (He quickly treated and released.) Thanks to
   tonight's blackboard gag, we know why!


>> She might fit in if she had one of those spiffy shirts

Alie Molino has this to say about the "Frankie Say: Relax" shirt:  This is a
   reference to shirts put out by the band "Frankie Goes to Hollywood" during
   the 1980s.  They're best known for the song "Relax."  Some of the T-shirts
   they sold did indeed say "Frankie Say: Relax," and most of the people who
   wore them wore them ridiculously oversized.


Nelson Fu adds:  The kid on the bus from last Sunday's episode was wearing a
   T-shirt that said "Frankie says RELAX."  Everyone knows that real Frankie
   Goes to Hollywood shirts always said "Frankie say RELAX" to denote that the
   band was considered one big group as opposed to a single person.

   Are we to supposed to believe that (phhhbtt) kids of Springfield Elementary
   are so poor that they have to buy counterfeit 80's retro wear?  I hope
   somebody got fired over this.


>> Name that victim

Jerry Steinhofer asks:  When Homer was recalling when he was a bully ...
   didn't the nerd he was abusing look like Smithers?


Nathan DeHoff:  Wasn't Smithers' age pretty well established in "The Old Man
   and the Lisa," when he stated that he was born [some number that I forgot]
   years after the stock market crash in 1929?  I believe that his age came
   out to be around 44 or something, while Homer is at least five years
   younger than that.  I guess they COULD have been in school together, but I
   wouldn't exactly buy a seventh-grade Homer beating up on a twelfth-grade
   Smithers (and they looked like they were closer in age to each other in
   that scene anyway).


"Surly" points out:  Let's not forget that that episode was a few years ago,
   adding that many years then could have made Smithers the same age as Homer.
   They don't age in the show, despite the number of birthdays they have.


Nathan DeHoff replies:  Yeah, trying to figure out how old a character is
   based on years is a tricky task, since the characters don't age.  Still,
   Smithers is almost definitely older than Homer.  He's "in his early
   forties," according to Troy McClure in the 138th Episode Spectacular, while
   Homer is between 36 and 39, depending on which episode you go by.
   Characters might not age, but they don't get younger, either.


Haynes Lee advances a different theory:  I think that's Artie Ziff that Homer
   was beating up as he has black hair.


"Dragon":  It was not Artie Ziff.  Artie Ziff has a very small face and a big
   afro.  It was Smithers.


Paul Tomko:  That was Smithers?  It looked like a generic nerd to me.  [...]
   It couldn't have been Smithers.  Smithers was already old enough to be an
   announcer at the gymnastics meet where Homer's Dad makes him screw up.


Alie Molino:  I thought that Smithers was supposed to be an announcer from the
   high school. If they have their own radio stations, high schools usually
   use students as the on-air talent.


Nathan DeHoff:  Maybe it was Waylon Smithers' brother, and Artie Ziff's
   cousin.  (That would also make Smithers Artie's cousin, but who says he's
   not?)


Taking another angle on the question, "Petros" writes:  The thing is, what
   that a "real" memory or one of Homer's famous wishful thinking memory
   revisions?  I always figured he was the victim of bullies in HS, not the
   bully.


Benyamin Powers:  There are different levels of nerds ... of course in a high
   school the gays are the lowest level ... even lower than Homer.  (The views
   of every high school class system do not reflect those of this typer.)


>> Aw ... baby with a nail gun

Dag Nabbit writes:  Most compressor driven nail guns (pneumatic) are easily
   and quite often "rigged" to fire without the tip needing to be depressed
   (as a veteran of many nail gun fights).  But you [John Jensen] are 100%
   [right] about the Paslode gas-powered nailer in Lethal Weapon.  Since the
   safety device (i.e. tip) actually engages the motor (run by battery),
   rigging this to fire automatically is impossible without the battery or
   motor dying very quickly.

   And of course, lacking a barrel or any kind of stabilizing device on the
   nail, they don't fly strait ... unless wizardry is involved.


>> Buddhism:  The safety-conscious faith

Red Halcyon asks:  When Homer suggests to Apu and Manjula that they switch to
   the round, non-pointy religion of Buddhism, they both react adversely.
   What's the conflict between these two religions?


Chad Lehman answers:  It's like suggesting a Christian convert to Judaism, or
   Hare Krishna, or something.


Kristian Ronge elaborates:  A major conflict is that Buddhism does not have
   the cast system, whereas Hinduism has.

   The basic practical consequence of this is that in Buddhism, salvation
   (well, not really, but the state of Nirvana) is reachable by people from
   all walks of life.  In Hinduism only people born into the highest cast
   (Brahmans(?), I forget) can do so.

   Poor Hindus (of lower cast) therefore tend to convert to Buddhism (the
   second biggest "local" religion in S.E. Asia), in ever increasing rates.
   ["Actually, Islam is the second biggest religion in SE Asia now, looking at
   Indonesia," says Brian Beck -- Ed.]


Tilman Menshevik writes:  Actually, within the context of the Indian
   subcontinent, it should be noted that historically the revival of the old
   religions in what is now called Hinduism enabled them to recoup their
   previous losses to Buddhism and reduce the latter to comparative
   insignificance except at the fringes (Sri Lanka, Tibet etc.). In the
   republic of India, only about 1 percent of the population (according to the
   encyclopedia I used) are Buddhists, who are thus outnumbered not only by
   Muslims (18 percent, and predominant in Pakistan and Bangla Desh), but also
   by Sikhs and Christians. So in its own native area, Hinduism actually was
   more successful with the lower ranks of society than Buddhism. Also, it
   should be noted that just as Buddhism managed to integrate elements (and
   gods) from older religions into itself, so Hinduism managed to
   "accommodate" Buddhism into its system -- for a worshipper of Vishnu, the
   Buddha is simply one of the ten avatars of that Vishnu.


>> Fun with math

Benjamin Robinson:  The square root of 1,000,000 is 1,000.  Whew -- that
   solves that mystery!


Tom Restivo:  Not quite ... there are TWO square roots to 1,000,000:  +1000
   and -1000.


>> Car Watch the safe way

Joe Green observes:  The car that almost runs over Ralph is a Volvo, most
   likely made in the late '80s or early '90s.


>> Attending science presentations can be hazardous to your health.

Benjamin Robinson:  One of the scientist big-wigs at Springfield's Big Science
   thing was Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General of the United
   States. (The Surgeon General directs government policy on health issues.)
   Koop was the man with the full beard and no moustache -- a comedian once
   joked he looked like the captain of an Amish battleship.  He's more famous
   for being the Surgeon General who publicly declared smoking to be a major
   health hazard, and it was he who put those ubiquitous warnings on cigarette
   packages.


>> Why CABF11 was great

Didn't like this episode?  Chad Lehman explains why you are wrong:  Classic
   Simpsons always took exaggerated ideas, and ran with them.  Family shock
   centers, beer commercials aimed at kids, or whatever.  Everything in their
   exaggerated world was normal to the Simpsons.  That made the jokes "tongue-
   in-cheek", and satirical.  We had to understand why the situation was
   funny, from the context .  There was a cigarette ad aimed at kids by
   Radioactive Man. Nowhere is there a narrator character, pointing out how
   reckless and downright wrong it was.  It was a part of The Simpsons'
   exaggerated world.  In their world, it was normal.

   Classic Simpsons plots are defined by either a sarcastic (satiric) or
   serious theme.  8F06, 9F09 and 3F02 had serious themes, though they were
   still funny because of the smaller sarcastic (satiric) themes within.
   9F01, 9F15 and 7F22 were very good examples of sarcastic resolutions to the
   main theme.  These two flavors of episodes both fit under the "show us,
   don't tell us" or "exaggerated America" concept.

   CABF11 fit nicely into the sarcastic theme resolution.  Lisa could easily
   have discovered a realistic reason for Francine's behavior, and the episode
   would still have been funny.  "Nerd sweat" wasn't just another silly thing,
   common in recent Simpsons episodes.  It was an extremely ridiculous
   solution to the question posed by the plot.  Why can't you reason with
   bullies?

   Lisa, as the force behind "nerd sweat", was the perfectly ironic choice.
   She's the level-headed one.  A season 10 or 11 episode would have her
   <vocally> outraged at such a simplistic idea.  But by using Lisa as the
   normally "trustable" character, peddling the idea of "nerd sweat", the
   commentary is sarcastic.  The greatest scientists in the world agreed.
   Lisa had solved the problem!

   The solution was ridiculous.  Lisa is someone we can trust.  These are two
   clues that someone's pulling our leg.  Lisa's character is the poker-face
   behind which the joke was hidden.  The fact that some people won't get that
   it's a joke makes the joke funnier.  The poker-face is sure to fool many
   people.  The sarcasm goes over their heads.

   Another very sarcastic plot resolution came in 7F23.  Everything works out
   for Ned Flanders, in a too-perfect way.  They come together at the end in a
   parody of "It's a Wonderful Life" that mocks the simplistic idea, more than
   pays homage to the movie.  Yet, the episode showed heart.

   The writers could have written a serious solution to 9F01's plot, where
   introspection makes Homer choose church over free-time.  8F06 could have
   ended sarcastically, with Homer getting third and fourth jobs to support
   large animals for each of the other family members.  But the themes would
   have remained the same.  Comic Book Guy saying "Oh, that's a REAL useful
   invention" in sarcasm means the same as "That's not a very useful
   invention" in seriousness.

   Yeah, I can see why "nerd sweat" appeared like one of the many other just
   plain "silly" elements from recent episodes.  "Nerd sweat" was silly, but
   it meant something.  It was a simplistic answer to the theme, which made it
   satirical.  Fireworks used to clean up a house is just plain silly, IMO.
   If anything, it was light social satire about Homer's devotion to laziness.
   Anything to avoid real work.  Meh.

   CABF11 could have also been written with a serious theme, exploring Lisa's
   emotional stability in the wake of a bully.  We could have seen her gather
   strength from within, and from others, to learn to accept the bully.  But,
   this wouldn't have been the same episode theme.  That theme would be "as a
   girl, how do you stand up to a bully?"  That's a different episode, all
   together.

   This idea would follow the "serious" theme model, but it is really no
   greater than the sarcastic model.  After all, we could very well see an
   episode that does just that in the future -- one that explores Lisa's inner
   strength.  This is why we should ignore episode continuity at all times.
   The threat of a "salad-dressing" antidote shouldn't prevent us from seeing
   this future ep.

   Great episode.  More, please.


>> Coming Attractions

Mike Reed faithfully transcribes:

   Voice-Over: Homer goes on a baby safety crusade!
   Homer: I'll draw bunny faces to scare Maggie away.
   Marge: She's not afraid of bunnies.
   Homer: She will be!
   Voice-Over: Will he be safe or sorry?
   Homer: Daddy's going to protect you from all the scary, sharp things.
   (hands her the nail gun) Hold this. (she staples his hand to the desk and
   his ears to the wall, laughing)


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show (hey, it's been a while since we
   had one of these) is:  Nerd on a Wire


Joe Green suggests:  Smells Like Preteen Spirit


According to Fox (by way of Bill LaRue), this episode scored a Nielsen rating
   of 8.7 (14 share).  This works out to 16.1 million viewers.  Among adults
   aged 18 to 49, the rating was 7.7 (19 share).

   The network goes on to boast, "In its 12th season, THE SIMPSONS is posting
   solid gains compared to its performance the same weeks last year,
   increasing +7% among Adults 18-49 (7.7/18 vs. 7.2/17), +7% in Adults 18-34
   (9.4/24 vs. 8.8/23), and +8% in Total Viewers (15.6 vs. 14.5 Mil)."  The
   show was also the second-  or third-highest ranked program for the week,
   depending on which demographic group you look at.


John Jensen:  Francine didn't say much the whole episode

   -- Oh yeah
   -- tastes like yours
   -- let me out of here!
   -- you're dead, nerd!
   -- knock this Dr. Dork. [{jlm} says it's really, "suck fist" -- Ed.]

   and that's it.


Haynes Lee:  The way Scratchy was opened with the H-cut is like those old six-
   pack small cereal boxes.  The box is literally  used as the cereal bowl.
   Can make a real mess.


Mike Reed:  I think this is the closest they've come to actually showing puke
   on the Simpsons.

-- "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Bart and Lisa are also running late.  They're still in the pajamas,
% and the school bus is only two blocks away.  Marge takes matters
% into her own hands.  She grabs both kids, hauls them up to the

% right in front of the school.  Bart and Lisa get onto the bus, which
% rolls forward a few feet to the "official" school bus stop.
%
% Before the children have the chance to get off the bus, Otto
% remembers that he forgot to pick up a new student.  He closes the

%
% The children wonder what the newcomer will be like.  Terri

%
% They're all wrong.  The new girl is nothing like they imagined. 
% She's a red-head, not fat but sturdily built, like a house or a

		comes loose]
Marge:		[gasps] She got it open!
Baby-proofer:	You see how quickly your baby could have been 
		drinking this [reads label] Similac Baby Formula?
Homer:		[anguished] No!  [takes the bottle and stomps on it] 
		This is such an eye-opener.  I always pictured the 
		kids dying in the living room.

% Later, the baby-proofer tallies up the cost of the safety equipment
% the Simpsons would need to protect Maggie from household hazards. 
% Homer considers the estimate momentarily, and then throws the baby-

		[runs out into the street] Babies of Springfield, we 
		need your help!  Please -- skin your knees!  Put 
		dice up your nose!  Let cats sleep on your face!
-- Homer's safety crusade comes to and end, "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% The Simpsons attend a convention of scientists.  Lisa is to present
% her findings about bullies.  She and Marge are a little intimidated
% by the crowd, which includes the inventor of the walkie-talkie (and
% someone who isn't his wife).
%
% Frink calls the crowd to order.

Frink:		Scientists -- scientists, please.  Looking for some 
		order.  Some order, please, with the eyes forward 
		and the hands neatly folded and the paying attention 
		... [shouts] Pi is exactly 3!  [the audience gasps 
		and falls silent] Very sorry it had to come to that, 
		but now that I have your attention, we have some 
		exciting new research from young Lisa Simpson.  
		Let's bring her out and pay attention.
		[the audience applauds as Lisa walks onstage.  The 
		crowd sees that she's a little girl, and doubts that 
		she has anything useful to say]
Lisa:		[clears throat] My study is called, "Airborne 
		Pheromones and Aggression in Bullies."
		[the crowd gasps.  Someone says, "I'm afraid"]
		For as long as there has been smart people, there 
		have been bullies to prey on them.  From Galileo 
		[shows a slide of the astronomer getting beaten up] 
		to Sir Isaac Newton, [another slide] and even in the 
		animal kingdom.  [shows a slide of a large dog 
		victimizing a smaller one]
		But why do the brawny prey on the brainy.  Is it 
		jealousy?
		[the crowd seems to think so]
		No!  The reason is chemical.  [the crowd murmurs]
Scientist 1:	Wait, that's impossible.  Chemicals are our friends.
Dr. Koop:	She's a witch!
-- But is she hazardous to your health?  "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Lisa asks for a chance to demonstrate.  She reveals her test 
% subject, Francine, locked in a cage.  (Lisa thanks Francine's
% parents for the caging help.)

I have isolated the chemical which is emitted by every geek, dork, and 
four-eyes.  I call it "poindextrose."
-- Lisa Simpson, "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Lisa applies some poindextrose to her wrists, and lets Francine get
% a whiff.  The bully goes into a tizzy.  Lisa asks Frink to open the
% cage, which he does, using a long pole to finagle open the latch. 
% Francine runs right at Lisa, who spritzes herself with something
% from an atomizer.  Francine stops just in front of Lisa, and looks
% around, puzzled.

Scientist 2:	My God, she's stopped in her tracks.
Scientist 1:	The little girl's invented some sort of bully 
		repellant.
		[the crowd murmurs, astonished]
Lisa:		Actually, it's just ordinary salad dressing.  [crowd 
		gasps]
Marge:		So that's where that went.
Lisa:		The pungent vinegar and tangy Roquefort block the 
		smell receptors, rendering the bully harmless.
		[the crowd applauds]
Frink:		Congratulations, Lisa.  You are truly the standout 
		at this year's science thing.  [hands Lisa an 
		envelope]
Lisa:		[looking at the envelope's contents] A gift 
		certificate from J. C. Penney's?
Frink:		Yes, you'll love their slacks, nn-hey.
Marge:		Oh, honey, we're so proud of you.  [kisses Lisa]
Homer:		So all her bullying was just to get some attention.
Lisa:		No, Dad, didn't you listen to anything I said?
Homer:		Just to get some attention.
-- "Bye Bye Nerdie"

% Frink calls for help.  Francine has begun bullying the scientists. 
% Despite having advantages in both size and numbers, the scientists
% are easy pickings for her.  Francine's parents assure Lisa that
% their girl will eventually tire herself out.  They and the Simpsons
% (except Lisa) laugh.  Francine knocks a few heads together, then
% starts sniffing around.  Her gaze locks on the camera.  She tenses,
% then pounces.  She's coming right at us!  Aieee!  Run for your
% lives, everyone!
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time:  20:12]
%
% "Safety First," the song playing in the background during Homer's
% baby-proofing of the town, is reprised over the closing credits
% (until it's time to promote next week's show).  No Gracie Sound, not
% even the "Shh," this week.
