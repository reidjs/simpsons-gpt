   [If you use these summaries to determine if you found the right capsule,
   here's a TV Guide-like synopsis:  After using his credit card to buy
   another dog, Bart must choose between his new wonder-pooch and the bumbling
   but loyal Santa's Little Helper. -- Ed.]

> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
==============================================================================
=  When Lisa turns her German Verb Wheel, the two windows in it disappear and
   reappear.  {ddg}

-  A glass of milk and a bowl with cereal in it only appear in front on Lisa
   when she opens her German wheel.  {ljs}

-  In the shot before we see the envelope containing Bart's credit card, Bart
   was holding a fork, with only a bowl a few inches away from Bart.  When
   Marge lowers the envelope, Bart has a filled bowl with a spoon in it, and
   there is a glass next to it, and a knife as well as a fork, most of which
   appears out of thin air.  {ol}

*  The letter from MoneyBank informs Bart that "occupant" (the addressee) has
   a good credit record.  But for MoneyBank to say that, they would have to
   make a specific record check on a specific member of the Simpson household,
   not just anyone there.  {ol}

=  Bart begins filling the credit form with his "Occupation," but when he
   writes down his name, we see that Bart has filled out his Soc. Security
   number, Date of Birth and Phone Numbers.  {ol}

=  If Bart was buying comic books A through Z, how come he only has a pile of
   the _Z_ comics to put on the counter?  {ol}

-  The hardcover Radioactive Man box set disappears.  {ljs}

+  Almost certainly the number to the Home Shopping Channel Bart bought that
   worthless I&S cel from was 1-800.  He should know what a 1-800 number is.
   {ol}

-  Bart's cordless phone has only nine buttons instead of the standard twelve.
   {jh}

==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Yes, we've seen the "Bart doesn't appreciate Santa's Little
   Helper, but misses him badly after he's gone, so he goes to great lengths
   to retrieve him" plot before, but I like how this episode approached the
   subject, there were many funny moments, and best of all, the ending was
   completely unexpected.  (B+)

Stephan Bonneville:  Not a bad outing.  Homer was a bit too immature, but the
   return of that one-eyebrowed baby was a nice surprise.  Milhouse going on
   about his goldfish was hilarious, and the scene with Willie (I 'ate him!)
   was also well played. A bit predictable, but good enough to earn a  (B)

Vince Chan:  Sigh, another 8th season episode.  The writers seem to be more
   interested in plot than humor.  Although the first part of the first act
   was very well done.  The rest of the episode seemed to lack humor, but the
   few seconds before the credits were pretty good.  The whole episode overall
   could have been better.  (C+)

Trevor Claffey:  Overall, a fairly weak episode; not much of a story to begin
   with, and a weak, (no pun intended) "pot-luck" ending.  What was with the
   lack of a subplot?  What happens to the credit card?  Not helping:
   stereotyping of the blind.  However, some funny jokes and the extra-long
   intro that, this season, has also been used in 3G01 and 3G03, make this
   episode worth watching.  Although I said that there was not much of a
   story, much of the classic "Bart-does-something-utterly- forbidden" plot
   (getting a credit card) pays off in this episode and the bit of story it
   has.  Not bad, but not all that good either.  (C)

Chris Courtois:  It's hard to say exactly what was wrong with "The Canine
   Mutiny", other than it just wasn't that funny or interesting.  This episode
   just limped along from one mildly amusing gag to another.  Even with a
   complete opening sequence this episode needed padding (Marge listening to
   the radio/frying pan).  And I'm really getting tired of the writers
   explaining the jokes to me, just in case I didn't get it (Bart remarking on
   "ate"/"hate" with Groundskeeper Willy). A few good gags saved it from the
   scrap heap, but overall this was one of the weakest shows Season 8 has
   offered up.  (Note I didn't say "worst episode ever" - this one wasn't
   close).  (C-)

Jonathan Haas:  Finally, a solid Season 8 episode!  As an utterly forgettable
   season nears its close, it's good to have at least one episode that
   qualifies as an instant classic.  The subplot is still apparently a thing
   of the past, but everything else about this episode was top-notch.
   Groundskeeper Willie was hilarious, as was the Comic Book Guy.  And for a
   change, the ending was a) hysterical, and b) a complete surprise.  Let's
   just hope that "Canine Mutiny" is not a fluke in a deteriorating series,
   but a sign that the Simpsons are back on track for good.  (A+)

Jason Hancock:  An average outing that didn't quite click with me, mainly
   because the SLH/Bart relationship has been done several times before -- I,
   like many on this group, would like to see Snowball II get a chance for
   once. Nonetheless, there were a few good moments in this one (like the pot
   scene in the end).  (B-)

Ryan Johnson:  A pretty good episode.  The only thing I didn't like about the
   episode were the animal death scenes.  The animal fire was in *really* poor
   taste.  Lots of funny little bits (the car-toons, and the repo depot) made
   up for it though.  (B)

Joe Klemm:  This is hands down one of the funniest episodes this season. The
   Mafia burial scene and the dog burning scene had me ROTFL and the Jammin'
   butchering by the cops at the end is a definite candidate for the next
   Simpsons album.  However, the only change I would make would be to add
   Colleen/Road Rovers jokes in it, since the dog is a collie.  (A+)

Ondre Lombard:  This one was a real snoozer.  Not in the fact that it wasn't
   funny, but the story just wasn't that intriguing or interesting.  Bart's
   mistake with SLH was quite predictable, and so was the fact that SLH's new
   owner would turn out to be blind (a plotline I've seen a number of times
   before).  I'm also disappointed at the cheapness of making blind Mr.
   Mitchell possess narcotics. Ron Hauge is turning out to be a typical
   Hollywood hack, with his ho-hum "twist" on an outrageous plot--Bart with
   the credit card.  I'd give the episode a lower grade, but C is quite
   sufficient for this forgettable tale. (BTW, the pun-title doesn't seem to
   relate to the story in any way.)  (C)

Abhi Ray:  I found this episode average.  The story's been done too many
   times.  Plus, stories involving SLH are too predictable.  "Bart's Dog Gets
   an F" was the worst episode ever for me.  "Dog of Death" was OK.  "2 1/2
   Dozen Greyhounds" was pretty good, but this episode just wasn't exciting.
   The best scenes were Bart trying to find who had SLH and the ending was
   hilarious.  (B)

Mark Aaron Richey:  A rather bland and boring episode.  Couldn't Bart have
   bought something more interesting than a bunch of tacky junk from a mail
   order catalog. And the "Lassie" parody really wasn't that very funny.  The
   finale involving blind Mr. Mitchell seemed to be awfully cliched, even with
   the marijuana twist finale.  (C-)

Sally Rosen:  Wow...I'm not sure what to say...Even if that marijuana bit at
   the end was funny, I don't think it was appropriate.  Luckily those
   bastards down at FOX have no conscience.  If they did, shows like "When
   Animals Attack" and "World's Scariest Police Chases" would never be shown.
   Oh well, not a total failure, but not even close to a great episode.  If
   not for that marijuana bit at the end, this episode would've been an F.
   (B-)

Yours Truly:  This show is typical of most recent episodes in that it stresses
   story fundamentals over outright laughs.  Fortunately, it's still funny
   enough to be amusing.  A fine twist near the end prevents a potentially
   sappy ending.  Overall, one of the better Santa's Little Helper episodes.

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Cat lovers demand equal time!

Benjamin Robinson:  Don Del Grande noted that this is the fourth Santa's
   Little Helper episode, while Snowball II has had none to her credit.  I
   submit this is because cats are less emotionally expressive than dogs, and
   thus harder to write for.  This bias isn't exclusive to "The Simpsons,"
   either.  Consider that many more movies have been made about dogs than
   cats.


Don Becker replies:  Good point, but Snowball II does get her share of
   mentions, though usually it's alongside, or because of, SLH (like the
   episode where she and SLH are walking on their hind legs and learn to say
   "I love you" to get OFF's attention.


>> The man behind the dog

According to "The Simpsons:  A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family," Dan
   Castellaneta provides Laddie a voice.  I am sticking with the original
   credit of Frank Welker, as he has traditionally done the animal voices on
   the series, and because Laddie sounds a little like the vice-presidential
   dog in "Homer's Enemy (4F19)."  Anyone who can reliably testify as to the
   identity of the voice behind Laddie is invited to write to
   <capsules@snpp.com>.


>> Writer Watch

Dale G. Abersold:  Previously, Ron Hauge wrote the highly-regarded "Homer's
   Phobia" [4F11], as well as writing for such Nickelodeon shows as "Ren &
   Stimpy" and "Kablam!"


>> Unless your last name is "Simpson," you may already be a winner!

Mark Aaron Richey:  Publishers' Clearinghouse -- One of two major mail-order
   magazine companies that pitch magazines while offering big cash prizes,
   usually around $10 million (American Family, which uses Dick Clark and Ed
   McMahon as spokesmen, is the other).  Recently, both companies have started
   sending out notices saying that, unless you order a magazine, you will be
   dropped.  My family hasn't ordered a magazine from Publishers Clearinghouse
   in about four years, and we still get stuff from them, all promising to
   drop us from the mailing list.  Meanwhile, we did order a couple of
   magazines from American Family about nine months ago.  All of their
   subsequent mailings have warned that we were about to drop us unless we
   ordered some magazines.


>> Hier wird Deutsch gesprochen!

Herr Dale G. Abersold:  Lisa's and Homer's German was correct (although
   Homer's pronunciation of "hungrig" was Americanized).  Strange that Lisa
   went straight from the first person singular to the third person ... she
   left out "du isst."  Not so strange, however, that Homer instinctively knew
   the German word for "to eat."


>> Don't leave home without Santos L. Helper

Benjamin Robinson:  Bart's adventures in revolving credit aren't as far-
   fetched as they first seem.  Lately, card issuers have been sending pre-
   approved card offers to just about anyone with a street address.  The
   results are sometimes humorous, with card offers going out to such
   obviously inappropriate candidates like small children.  I don't know of
   any dogs getting their own credit card [ah, but read on -- Ed.], but at
   least one offer was extended to a lady's -cat-.


Howard MacGregor provides this humorous real-life example:  I liked Bart's
   credit card caper because my brother has legitimately held an American
   Express card in his dog's name for some years now. I won't give the exact
   name because somebody might fink him out to American Express but it's very
   much like this (and actually even more obvious): Rover Ourmutt.

   The way Rover Ourmutt got the card was via the phone company. My brother
   had wanted an unlisted number but that was going to cost a monthly fee so
   he had the original listing done as Rover Ourmutt. Bell had all their
   financial/credit  stuff on my bro tied to Mr. Ourmutt. AmEx Canada later
   apparently bought good risk names from Bell and followed Bell's credit
   rating to issue the card automatically.  He [...] uses it frequently so the
   dog (now long gone) has always maintained a good credit rating.

   One time a restaurant waiter of little humor spotted the name and thought
   he'd earn a reward by turning my brother in.  He phoned the American
   Express hotline and was promptly told to return the card to Mr. Ourmutt. So
   maybe American Express has a sense of humor - as long as they get paid.


>> Bart's credit application form

Mark Aaron Richey ruminates on Bart's form-filling technique:  On the credit
   card application, Bart put his Social Security number as 123-45-6789.  I'm
   impressed that he knew the right form for SS#'s.  He also put, as his birth
   month, either a 3 or a 7.  It looks like a 7 (which would make sense, if
   Lisa was born in August), but that would mean that Bart makes his sevens in
   the European style, with a line through the middle, which really doesn't
   seem likely for him.  On the other hand, he could have just plucked that
   date out of midair.


>> But do they publish cartoons?

Mark Aaron Richey:  "The New Yorker" -- an upscale literary magazine
   containing (mostly negative) movie, book, and play reviews, short stories,
   and non-fiction pieces.  In other words, Lisa's type of magazine, but Bart
   and Homer wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole.  The mascot of the
   magazine, Eustance B. Tilley, had a cameo in [3F22] "Summer of 4 Ft. 2"


>> Jesse Owens

Mark Aaron Richey (yes, him again):  One of the greatest track runners of all
   time, he won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, much to the
   chagrin of Hitler, who had planned to use the Games to prove his theories
   of Aryan superiority.  Trivia note: the 200 Meter silver that year went to
   Mack Robinson, Jackie Robinson's brother.


>> The secret society for Ivy-League dogs

Dale G. Abersold:  "Skull and Bones" is an exclusive secret society at Yale;
   it first gained attention when it was revealed that George Bush was a
   member.  Supposedly, initiation rituals include nude wrestling and other
   activities too, uh, unsavory to mention here.  Monty is evidently not a
   member, since members don't even mention the name of the society in public.


>> 57 Auburn Street

Al Ju:  The address of the blind guy in tonight's episode was 57 Mt. Auburn
   Street.  Mt. Auburn Street is a central street running through Cambridge
   very close to Harvard Square.  I don't know if the exact address is
   supposed to refer to any location, although I think that location is very
   close to the Lampoon's address.


TomR@fred.net writes:  Thanks to search engines, we see that the Harvard Boys
   were Hub-centric in its in-joke, but NOT to Harvard or the Square

   "Mt Auburn Club

   57 Mt. Auburn Street, Watertown, 617-923-2255.  For those who like to look
   and watch while exercising, there is the upscale Mt. Auburn Club facility
   in Watertown.  Indoor and outdoor tennis courts, squash courts, swimming
   pools, Stairmaster and a well-equipped exercise room, steam and sauna."

   Watertown, BTW, is the next city over from Cambridge.


Michael Giovinco replies:  57 Mt. Auburn St. As [Al Ju] pointed out this is a
   street in Harvard Square, and might be near the Harvard Lampoon.  Close --
   it is actually the Harvard Lampoon's address.  I lived across the street
   from it for 3 years and while the Lampoon probably doesn't publicize their
   address freely (i.e. probably not available on the web or in phone books),
   I've read the '57' on the Lampoon castle which sits in the middle of Mt.
   Auburn.  In my opinion, this is what they were referring to - not some
   health club in Watertown.

   [Editor's note:  Benjamin W. Dreyfus is also convinced this is the
   Lampoon's address.]


>> "Hold on Chief... it might be medicinal."

Jonathan Haas weighs in on the issue of marijuana use:  This is a reference to
   the recent controversy surrounding marijuana's medical uses.  Among other
   things, it's allegedly effective in treating glaucoma.  By relieving
   pressure inside the eye, it can stave off blindness (hence, "without it, I
   could go even blinder!")  It also reduces nausea and stimulates appetite,
   which makes it a popular treatment among those suffering from AIDS-related
   wasting syndrome.

   In the United States, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, meaning
   that it is not available even with a doctor's prescription.  After numerous
   efforts to get that classification changed, many groups advocating medical
   marijuana got fed up and put the question before voters directly.  In 1996,
   voters in California and Arizona passed initiatives to legalize marijuana
   for medicinal use.  (The Arizona initiative also permits doctors to
   prescribe other illicit drugs as well.)  The Clinton Administration leapt
   into action, warning doctors that they'd face revocation of their licenses
   if they prescribed or even recommended marijuana.

   In over 5,000 years of use, marijuana has yet to cause a single death.
   (Contrast this with alcohol and tobacco, each of which causes an annual
   death toll in the six figures in the United States alone.)  The federal
   government's war on this substance (described by a DEA judge as 'one of the
   safest therapeutically-active substances known to man') is, in this humble
   writer's opinion, unconscionable.

   By the way, some may view the "it might be medicinal" as placing
   Springfield's location in California or Arizona, as these are the only two
   states that have medical marijuana laws at the moment.  However, it's
   possible that it was just a ploy to give Bart an excuse to run along so the
   adults could share a smoke.  (I think it's pretty obvious that that's what
   happened, don't you?)

   [disclaimer: I don't smoke pot.  But I've got nothing against those who do,
   and I wish the government would stop jailing them and ruining their lives
   for an activity that hurts nobody.  -- JSH]


>> What does "bogart" mean, anyway?

Benjamin Robinson:  This is answered, in all places, the Beavis and Butt-Head
   FAQ.  (What, you didn't read the B&B FAQ before posting to
   alt.tv.simpsons?)  And your guess about it relating to Bogart's smoking
   habit is about right.

   In the movies, Bogart constantly had a cigarette dangling from his lip.
   Marijuana users who pass a single joint around picked up on this fact. When
   someone hogged a joint, they'd say, "Hey man, don't Bogart that." The use
   expanded to someone who hogged anything ("Hey man, don't Bogart that issue
   of 'Simpsons Illustrated'") and spilled over to the drug-free world.

   Too bad that line didn't make it over to the credits; it would have been
   the perfect thing to say.


>> And you thought they used the long opening to please the audience

Ondre Lombard noticed this while transcribing the episode:  The episode itself
   ran about 20 minutes and 29 seconds.  Pretty short.  Perhaps why this is
   the first 4F episode to use the long opening.  (The first non-Al Jean and
   Mike Reiss commissioned episode to feature the long opening since 2F08,
   "Fear of Flying").  Conclusively, I assume this episode will be left
   largely uncut in syndication due to its length.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

Dale G. Abersold:  Beverly Sills (briefly mentioned during Lisa's pep-pill-
   powered tirade) is a legendary American operatic soprano and television
   personality.


Joe Klemm:  The game Bart is playing in his room is Pachinko.  It is a popular
   game in Japan.  In it, people shoots balls, trying to get them in holes to
   get more balls, which can be used to buy things.


Ondre Lombard:  Funny how Rev. Lovejoy got karma for making his dog urinate on
   Ned's front lawn, with Santa's Little Helper "unholying the holy water."


Benjamin Robinson:  The song playing on the frying pan-radio was, the original
   version of "You Really Got Me."  (Don Becker points out it's the Kinks'
   version.)  "Jammin'" played as the ending credits.


Paul Ziemba:  Bob Marley was a good choice of music for the ending, because
   reggae is associated with Rastafarians, who are known to use marijuana.

% "Yeah.  That's him, all right."  So, SLH is loaded into a Repo van.
% "Sorry, boy.  I didn't plan this.  It just sort of happened," is
% Bart's parting words to SLH as the Repo van drives away.  Laddie licks
% Bart's hand and trots off, while Bart looks down glumly.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 8:33]
%
% On another morning, Marge gives Bart the OK to just once feed Laddie
% from the table.  Homer comments that Laddie seems a bit snooty.

Marge:    Homer, are you wearing a tie to impress Laddie?
Homer:    Do you think he noticed?
Marge:    [rolls eyes] [sneakishly puts on lipstick to impress Laddie]
-- A family not fit for a dog, "The Canine Mutiny"

% Lisa asks, "Where's Santa's Little Helper?"  Bart quickly explains
% that the took him to a kennel two towns over, just to get settled with
% Laddie.

Well, we wrecked the first dog.  We've gotta treat this one right.
-- Marge, after Bart attains Laddie the Wonder Dog, "The Canine Mutiny"

% When the family can't agree on who gets to walk Laddie this time,
% Lisa suggests the entire family walk the dog.  At the Springfield Dog
% Park, the Simpsons and Laddie mingle with the high class dogs.

Kent:     Hey, that is one fine looking animal you got there.
Homer:    Wow.  TV's Kent Brockman!  [shakes Kent's hand]
Kent:     Ha ha!  Hey, this fellow's not available to stud, is he?
Homer:    You want some puppies, eh, Mr. Brockman?
Kent:     No, no.  Jessica's been fixed.  She just needs a little [tsk
          tsk] attention.
-- Two Dozen and One Collies, "The Canine Mutiny"

% Mr. Burns even admires Laddie.  Otto comes over and sees if Laddie
% can catch a Frisbee.  Laddie, ahead of the flying Frisbee, catches it
% and throws it back with his mouth. (The Frisbee bounces off Homer's
% head).  Milhouse admires the dog, saying he's better than SLH.  Bart
% sadly comments that he's the only one who loved SLH, and Milhouse
% agrees.

Remember the time he ate my goldfish, and you lied to me and said I
never had any goldfish?  Then why did I have the bowl, Bart?  Why did I
have the bowl?
-- Milhouse, "The Canine Mutiny"

% "Yeah.  He was a great dog," Bart concludes, and walks away while
% everyone hangs out with Laddie.
%
% In his pyjamas, Bart really begins to regret giving up SLH, and
% imagines that SLH, along with a few other dogs, are being thrown into
% an incinerator for the purposes of speeding up a cruise ship.  "Nah,
% that's not too likely.  But still.  You're gone.  Where are you, boy?"
% Bart looks outside his window, and a boat's horn can be heard.
%
% Homer and Bart watch TV when Laddie walks in and gives Bart novelty
% card #00041 that says, "Time for a walk."  Bart is annoyed that he
% needs so many walks.  Homer says, "I'd take him, but those cards are
% non-transferable."
%
% Bart tiredly walks the dog.  Laddie hears a woman screaming for help
% and pulls Bart forward.  Next thing you know, Mayor Quimby is honoring
% "Heroic Dog" Laddie, who saved Gerald -- the baby with one eyebrow.
% After Laddie receives a medal, Bart asks, "NOW can we go home?"  But
% then Wiggum approaches, saying he wishes the police had a dog like
% Laddie.  Bart gives Laddie to Wiggum.  Wiggum starts gushing like a
% little boy and hugs Laddie.
%
% At the breakfast table, Maggie dumps a bowl of oatmeal over her head.
% Marge asks Homer to clean her up.

Homer:    Laddie!  [whistles]  Come'ere, boy!
          [invitingly]  Who wants to lick a messy baby?
-- How Homer cleans up Maggie, "The Canine Mutiny"

% When Laddie won't show up, Bart tells him he gave Laddie away.

Marge:    What's the matter, Bart?  Weren't you happy with him?
Bart:     No, he just wasn't the right dog for me.  I'm sure he'll be
          happy as a police dog.
Homer:    [angrily] He better know how to keep his mouth shut.
-- Bart gives Laddie the wonderdog away, "The Canine Mutiny"

% Understanding Marge decides they'll just get Santa's Little Helper
% back from the kennel, but then Bart breaks down and admits he gave SLH
% away too.

You gave BOTH dogs away??  You know how I feel about giving!
-- Homer, "The Canine Mutiny"

% "I'm sorry!  I know it's wrong, I messed everything up and now I
% don't have any dogs at all!" sobs Bart.  Homer tries to calm Bart
% down, and offers to get him a new dog, but Bart doesn't want a new
% dog.

Homer:    Well, crying isn't gonna bring him back, unless your tears
          smell like dog food.  So you can either sit there crying and
          eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell
          enough like dog food to make your dog come back -- or you can
          go out there and find your dog.
Bart:     You're right!  I'll do it.
          [Bart runs out the kitchen]
Homer:    Rats.  I almost had him eating dog food!
-- Homer encourages Bart to retrieve Santa's Little Helper,  "The
   Canine Mutiny"

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:54]

Bart:     I'm going to get the dog back!
Homer:    [off-camera, distant] The good dog or the bad dog?
Bart:     The bad dog.
Homer:    Ah good.
-- Bad dogs, bad dogs, whatcha gonna do..., "The Canine Mutiny"

% At the Repo Depo (where Moe's floor was repossessed because he hasn't
% paid his bills), the repossessor tells Bart that he sold SLH to "some
% guy wearing a dress."
%
% Bart goes to Patty and Selma's place first.  Patty didn't buy Bart's
% dog, and she has to go rescue Selma, because she thinks she swallowed
% a Band-Aid.
%
% The next "guy wearing a dress" -- Groundskeeper Willy.

Willy:    Yeah, I bought your mutt.  And I 'ate him!  [raises a huge
          bone of meat]
          [Bart gasps]
          [tears meat off the bone] I 'ate his little face, I 'ate his
          guts, and I 'ate the way he's always barkin'!  [tosses a bone
          behind him]
          So, I gave him to the church.
Bart:     [relieved] Ohh, I see.  You _hate_ him, so you gave him to
          the church.
Willy:    Aye.  I also 'ate the mess he left on me rug!
          [Bart turns around, stares at Willy]
          Ya heard me!
-- I don't wanna know, "The Canine Mutiny"

% At the Church Thrift Shop ("Nobody Beats the Rev"), Lovejoy recalls
% his brief ownership of SLH, and lists the bad things he did under his
% care.

He unholied the holy water!
-- Agnes describes what Santa's Little Helper did at church to Bart,
   "The Canine Mutiny"

% ...so Rev. Lovejoy gave SLH to a parishioner.  Lovejoy gives Bart the
% man's address.  Agnes nastily tells Bart to get out, then adds "Angel"
% after Lovejoy stares at Agnes askance.
%
% At the house of Mr. Mitchell, Bart finds SLH in his backyard, sitting
% as if he's in a trance while being splashed with water by the
% oscillating water sprinkler.  Bart buzzes the man's intercom to talk
% to him about his dog.  He tells him to wait just a minute.  In the
% meantime, Bart spits into his hands, wipes it onto his eyes and starts
% rehearsing his act of pathetic begging.  Mr. Mitchell turns out to be
% blind.

Mr. Mitchell: Hi there.  How can I help you?
Bart:         _You're_ the guy who owns the dog?
Mr. Mitchell: Yep.  His name is Sprinkles.
Bart:         Sprinkles?!
Mr. Mitchell: Yeah, he's my best buddy, eh.  'specially since my parrot
              decided to stop talking.
              [the parrot in question is now a dead skeleton in a cage]
              Polly?  Polly, wanna say hi to my guest?  Eh?  Fine, be
              that way.
-- Bart's dog's new owner turns out to be blind, "The Canine Mutiny"

% Mr. Mitchell asks Bart how he can help him, but Bart says forget it
% and leaves.
%
% In the worst way possible, Bart explains his plan to steal SLH from
% Mr. Mitchell to Lisa, inspiring her to remark, "Bart, that is a new
% low."  Lisa promises not to tell Homer and Marge only because she
% wants SLH back, but she asks Bart to try not to freak out Mr.
% Mitchell.  Bart can't promise to try, but promises to try to try.
%
% Dressed entirely in black, Bart clips through Mr. Mitchell's backyard
% fence, but finds SLH is inside the house.  Bart sneaks in through the
% doggy door at the back of the house.  He finds SLH and tells him how
% much he missed him.  SLH's barking alerts Mr. Mitchell, who walks down
% the stairs arming himself with his cane.  Bart tries to escape, but
% ends up forced to hide.  Mitchell gets SLH to help him find Bart, who
% hid under the piano, but is forced to move elsewhere when SLH starts
% licking him.  He runs into the closet (which happens to be right next
% to the exiting door), and Mr. Mitchell traps him.
%
% Mr. Mitchell torments who he believes to be the burglar he trapped in
% the closet.  Bart tells him he's just a kid and he came to get his dog
% back. Mr. Mitchell is surprised to hear "Sprinkles" is Bart's dog.
% Later, Bart explains his entire story.  Mr. Mitchell clarifies the
% bottom line, which is, "You want a blind man to give up his only
% companion."  "Yes, please," Bart replies.  Mitchell decides to let the
% dog decide.  Both start calling for Sprinkles, er, Santa's Little
% Helper, who after a while, starts chasing his tail, but finally goes
% to Bart.  Mr. Mitchell sadly congratulates Bart. Bart says he wishes
% they both could have dogs, then the door is busted down.

[busts down the door, rings the doorbell]
Hello!  Police!  Aw man, if this one's not the right house, I quit!
-- Chief Wiggum answers blind Mr. Mitchell's call for burglary,  "The
   Canine Mutiny"

% Mitchell tells him it was a false alarm, and in comes Laddie, who
% seems to get friendly with Mitchell, but then he sniffs his pocket and
% finds a package of marijuana.  Before Wiggum can get too hasty, Eddie
% remarks that they could be medicinal.

Without it, I could, uh... go even blinder! ... Right?
-- Mr. Mitchell, after the cops find his marijuana, "The Canine Mutiny"

% Wiggum sends off Bart.  Reunited, Bart walks off with Santa's Little
% Helper.  Meanwhile, another squad car drives up to Mr. Mitchell's
% house, with two other cops inside and a prostitute.  They all have a
% party, and "Jammin'" by Bob Marley starts.  Wiggum starts singing
% along.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 20:29]
%
% Wiggum's singing along with Bob Marley's "Jammin'" plays over the
% credits.
