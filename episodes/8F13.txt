In the USA, cut from clouds directly to driveway (to make room for FOX's
promotional material).

Blackboard :- `I will not aim for the head'.
              `I will not aim forth' at cutoff.

    The blackboard was aired in Canada.
    Dave Hall {dh} says that the `r' and `t' were definitely closer
    together in the cutoff line.

Driveway   :- Homer says `D'oh!' when Lisa scoots past.
              Homer says `Waugh!' when the car closes in on him.

Couch      :- In the mad dash for the couch, everyone except Maggie
              clonks their heads together and collapse unconscious.
              Maggie gets the couch all to herself.

    ... Homer closed his eyes when he swung the bat?  So much for
        ``keep your eye on the ball''.
    ... Smithers wore his badge even when not at the plant?
    ... when Bart and Lisa are taunting Darryl, Maggie puts her hand

   ...Karl signed his name with a `C'?  [So I guess Homer can't spell
      Karl's name; see [7F15]. --rjc]
   ...in Homer's flash-back, he tried to open the door by placing his foot
      on the door while pulling on the door knob?  (Think about it.)
      [Ah, but this is <always> how cartoon characters try to open locked
      doors. --rjc]
   ...Maggie, waving hands, reaching up for Homer?
   ...something wrong with Barney's picture?  Answer: No beer mug near, or in
      hand.

===============================================================================

Scott Amspoker {sa}:  I thought the episode was not up to par until
this moment [Burn's ``Well, DUH!''] which cracked me up.  The rest
of the episode was top notch.

Alan J. Rosenthal {ajr}:  A good one!

Yours Truly {rjc}:  Another strong showing.  I was guessing that the `Shhh...'
of the Gracie Logo would be an umpire yelling, ``Play ball!''  And every time
I see Homer's game-winning hit-by-pitch in the faded B&W clip, I laugh out
loud.

A slow-pitch softball team has ten players.  Though it looks like they were
playing fast-pitch, which team has nine players, just like baseball.  Don't
even try quoting rules until you find a set of rules that requires you to
chug a beer before leaving first base.

They are playing for the city championship, but we've been led to believe
that Shelbyville is a neighboring town.  (See, however, the discussion in
the capsule for `The Way We Was' [7F12].)

From one angle, Burns is giving the signs while standing on the third base
foul line.  But from another angle, he's on the grass.

In the closing song, the pitcher after Apu pitches overhand.

> Dave Hall's continuity report:

Introduction shot of Burn's office doesn't show Burn's baseball chart of
`dead-ringers'.

Smithers dropped the bag when Mike Scioscia shot at him, yet in the wide
shot, Smithers is still holding it.

Homer's fork disappears for one scene during dinner.

The Brain and Nerve Tonic doesn't appear in Burn's back pocket until he was
about to take it out.

There are no street lamps during Steve Sax's nighttime drive.  He also
sprouted a seat belt after being pulled over.

Ozzie Smith didn't have a camera when he entered the `Mystery Spot'.

Smither's ID card disappeared from his jacket for several scenes.

Although Burns and Smithers were sitting in the corner of the dug-out,
Burns walked off camera to the same corner to yell at the hypnotist.

Strawberry wiped a tear from his eye using his right hand, yet before and
after shots shows a mitt on that hand.

Pan shot shows Lenny and Karl on base when Strawberry goes up to bat, yet
after Burns calls Strawberry back, Lenny and Karl appear in the dug-out.

> Media coverage
===============================================================================
Brian Mathason (BKM106@psuvm.psu.edu) points out the following article, which
appeared in the 27 Jan 92 issue of Sports Illustrated:

    Homer's Odyssey (nine major leaguers get animated on the Simpsons)

    Homer Simpson pinch-hitting for Darryl Strawberry? And more amazing:  a
    selfless, surehanded Darryl Strawberry?  This must be a world of the
    make-believe.

    Don't have a cow, it is.  In an episode of the Simpsons that will air on
    Feb. 20, Mr. Burns, Homer's boss, assembles a lineup of formidable ringers
    for his company softball team.  Jose Canseco and Ken Griffey Jr. join
    Strawberry in the outfield, while Roger Clemens and Mike Scioscia form
    the battery.  Around the horn the Springfield Nuclear Plant team boasts
    Don Mattingly, Steve Sax, Ozzie Smith, and Wade Boggs.

    ``Virtually all the writers on the staff are rotisserie league junkies,''
    says Simpsons creator Matt Groening.  (This explains why---since fielding
    doesn't count in Rotisserie baseball---Boggs is drawn with a glove on his
    right hand.  The real Boggs throws right handed.)  Last spring, in an
    overt act of collusion, the writers conspired to create the ultimate
    Rotisserie team and write a show around it, using the actual major league
    players to provide voice-overs.  Throughout the summer, whenever one of
    the Springfield nine visited Southern California on a road trip, he would
    come into the studio to read his lines.

    ``I was surprised that the players were so amiable,'' says writer John
    Swartzwelder, whose script poked fun at their images.  It portrays
    Strawberry, for example, as a spry fielder and team leader who throws
    around such words as ``hustle'' and ``attitude''.  Mattingly is booted
    from the team for failing to trim his sideburns.  And Boggs is punched
    out by a patron at Moe's Tavern after a dispute over who was England's
    greatest prime minister.

    Not everyone appreciated Swartzwelder's sense of humor, however.  ``One
    of the players' wives objected to her husband's having an affair with
    Mrs. Krabappel, Bart Simpson's teacher,'' says Groening, who was then
    forced to say ``No way, Jose'' to the plot twist.

    As a rule, prematurely bald characters are not outstanding baseball
    players.  Take Charlie Brown.  Or Barry Lions.  Yet with two outs in the
    bottom of the ninth and the score tied, Homer, who bats right handed, is
    called upon to pinch hit for the left-handed Strawberry against a
    southpaw.  Homer then strides to the plate as if it were piled high
    with glazed doughnuts.

    Does Simpson strike out or get a hit?  We won't spoil it for you, but
    rest assured that the climax is touching.  You may even find yourself
    reaching for a Homer Hanky.

                - John Walters

For those who don't know the term, in Rotisserie League baseball, you choose
nine major league players and score points based on their performance.

Ron Carter {rc} produces this article from the 23 Feb 92 Rocky Mountain
News sports section:

    SPORTS PEOPLE  Life tends to imitate art in major leagues

    If you saw last week's episode of `The Simpsons', the
    one in which several major league stars are recruited to
    play on Homer's office softball team, then you saw Don
    Mattingly get kicked off the club in a dispute about a
    haircut and watched Darryl Strawberry feud with a teammate.

    Just simple parodies of what happened last season, right?
    Wrong, the show's staff says.  ``That script was written and
    ready to record in July,'' co-producer Jon Vitti said.

    Mattingly really did get benched because he wouldn't get
    a haircut.  And Strawberry did get into a snit with teammate
    Kal Daniels.

    There also was a script, Vitti said, that called for Jose
    Canseco to have marital problems.

With help from Kent A. Neier (neierka@victoria.cs.rose-hulman.edu)
               Ted Frank {thf}

    Jose Canseco and Darryl Strawberry have a reputation for being selfish
    and insensitive.  Canseco is also accused of being money-grubbing
    (at one point being among the top five highest-paid players), and he
    was romantically linked with Madonna for a brief while.  (His wife
    didn't take kindly to this.)

    The chant of ``Darryl...'' was a taunt started by the `fans' at Shea
    (the home stadium of the New York Mets, Strawberry's former team).
    It has since spread elsewhere.

    Don Mattingly got into trouble with management when they insisted
    he trim his long hair.  George Steinbrenner is the former general
    manager of the New York Yankees (Mattingly's team) who was known
    for being unreasonably demanding.

    Roger Clemens has had run-ins with the police, belying his position
    as a security guard.  His clucking like a chicken is a reference
    to Mark `The Bird' Fidrych, a pitcher for the Detroit Tigers in the
    early 80's.  He would peck around the mound just like Roger did,
    and talk to the ball.  (He would also hand-sculpt the mound at
    the beginning of each inning.)  Fidrych's attempted comeback involved
    a well-publicized series of visits with a hypnotist.

% machines and cool dials and stuff.  Like an oil refinery, or hydro-electric

%
% At Graceland, the tour guide shows Elvis's three television sets.
% There, Smithers approaches Ozzie Smith.
%
% Smithers rings a doorbell, and the door is answered by Don Mattingly,
% who was doing the dishes.  Mattingly eagerly invites Smithers in.
%
% Smithers invites Steve Sax, who was performing with the Steve Sax Trio.
%
% At a company meeting, Burns introduces security guard Roger Clemens,
% janitor Wade Boggs, lunchroom cashier Ken Griffey, Jr., and Steve Sax,
% Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia, and Jose
% Canseco (for whom he'll make up jobs later).  The employees are
% impressed until they realize that the players are joining the softball
% team.  Lenny complains, ``Mr. Burns, with them on the team, you won't
% need us!''  Burns replies, ``Well, DUH!''
%
% Burns orders Scioscia to sign up, but Mike is excited about working the
% solid contaminant encapsulator.  ``One more outburst like that and I'll
% send you back to the big leagues.''

Homer:  You're Darryl Strawberry.
Darryl: Yes?
Homer:  You play right field.
Darryl: Yes?
Homer:  I play right field, too.
Darryl: So?
Homer:  Well, are you better than me?
Darryl: Well, I never met you... but... Yes.
-- Any questions? ``Homer at the Bat''

% At dinner, Homer grouses that the whole team worked hard to reach the
% championship game, only to be replaced.  Meanwhile, Maggie feeds her
% Brussel sprouts to SLH.

Marge: What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better
       than you?
Homer: Marge, forget it.  He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger
       than me, and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.
Bart:  You make me sick, Homer.  You're the one who told me I could do
       anything if I just put my mind to it!
Homer: Well, now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's
       a crock!  No matter how good you are at something, there's always
       about a million people better than you.
Bart:  Gotcha.  Can't win, don't try.
-- Lesson for the day, ``Homer at the Bat''

% The team is on the field for practice.  Burns is wearing an old-style
% uniform with ``Zephyrs'' on the front.  He lectures the players that
% they all have to earn their spot on the team.  And instead of beer,
% they are instead to drink a special nerve tonic which promotes health
% (though has also been known to cause gigantism, but only in rare cases).
% Ken Griffey, Jr. takes a sip and is hooked.  Time for the training to
% begin, and all groan when Smithers brings out the medicine balls.
%
% In the training room, everybody is working out, except for Homer, who
% is in one of those steam reducing gizmos.
%
% At the plate, Burns demonstrates how to bunt.  But when the ball hits
% the bat, Burns goes sailing into the backstop.

Smithers: What are you going to do with the million dollars, sir?
Burns:    Oh, I dunno.  Throw it on the pile, I suppose.
-- Burns has bet $1 million on the softball team, ``Homer at the Bat''

% To help seal the victory, Burns hires a hypnotist.

Hynpotist: You are all very good players...
Team:      [entranced] We are all very good players...
Hypnotist: You will beat Shelbyville...
Team:      We will beat Shelbyville...
Hypnotist: You will give one hundred and ten percent...
Team:      That's impossible.  No one can give more than one hundred percent.
           By definition that is the most anyone can give...
-- You own a mansion and a yacht...  ``Homer at the Bat''

% Back in the field, a fly ball is hit to Homer, but Darryl Strawberry
% leaps upwards out of frame to catch the ball.  When Homer complains,
% Darryl says to Burns, ``Some of these players have a bad attitude, Skip.''
%
% At the plant...

Mike Scioscia: [pushing a wheelbarrow of glowing green goop]
Karl:  [pulls up beside him with his own wheelbarrow of glowing green goop]
       Hey, Scioscia.  I don't get it.  You're a ringer, but you're here every
       night in the core, busting your butt hauling radioactive waste.
Mike Scioscia: Well, Karl, it's such a relief from the pressures of playing
       big-league ball.  I mean, there, you make any kind of mistake, and
       boom, the press is all over you.  [accidentally spills his goop]
       Uh oh...
Karl:  Ah, don't worry about it.
Mike Scioscia: Oh man, is this ever sweet...

%
% It's the day before the game, and Burns gives his team some final advice.
% (Darryl Strawberry chimes in sycophantically.)

Now, before I post the starting line-up, I want to assure those of you
whose names are not on the list... that I'm very disappointed in you.
-- Monty Burns, softball team manager, ``Homer at the Bat''

Homer: Please please please, I want to make the team.  [catches Roger Clemens]
       Clemens, did I make the team?
Roger: You sure did!
Homer: I did!  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  In your face, Strawberry!
Roger: Wait a minute, are you Ken Griffey, Jr.?
Homer: No.
Roger: Sorry.  Didn't mean to get your hopes up.

% [End of Act Two]
%
% In his office, Burns gloats that there's no way he could lose his bet.
% ``Unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate
% misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow.  But that will never happen.
% Three misfortunes, that's possible.  Seven misfortunates, there's an
% outside chance.  But nine misfortunes?  I'd like to see that!''
%
% His wish is the writer's command.
%
% Steve Sax is pulled over by the two cops.  When they see that he's from

%
% Mike Scioscia lies in a hospital bed, a nearby Geiger counter clicking away.

Dr. Hibbert:  Uh, Mike, try to lift your arm.
Mike Scioscia: Can't... lift... arm... or... speak... at... normal... rate...

% Thanks to acute radiation poisoning, he's out of the game.  Ken Griffey,
% Jr. is wheeled in, his head swollen to gargantuan proportions, thanks to
% the nerve tonic.
%
% Jose Canseco is walking down the street when he passes a burning house.
% The woman outside pleads for him to rescue her baby.  Being the kind,
% generous soul that he is, Jose rushes into the burning house and emerges
% with the child.  She then hears her cat, and Jose rescues it as well.
% She hears her player piano.  Jose pulls up his collar and heads back in
% again.
%
% In bed...

Homer: Oh, one thing I'm good at and I can't do it any more.
Marge: Homey, you're good at lots of things.
Homer: Like what?
Marge: Like snuggling?  [snuggles up to him]
Homer: Yeah.  but none of my friends can watch me.
-- It's an indoor sport, ``Homer at the Bat''

% At Moe's Tavern...

Barney: And I say, England's greatest Prime Minister was Lord Palmerston!
Wade Boggs: Pitt the Elder!!
Barney: Lord Palmerston!!!
Wade Boggs: Pitt the Elder!!!!  [pokes Barney]

% Burns again tells Mattingly to get rid of his sideburns.  Mattingly tries
% to explain that he isn't wearing sideburns, but Monty won't hear anything
% of it and sends him off.  Smithers gives Burns the reports on the missing
% players.  Ozzie Smith is still falling.  (He takes a snapshot on the way
% down.)  Jose Canseco is still rescuing household appliances from the
% burning house.  (``The dryer goes on the right.'')  Roger Clemens thinks
% he's a chicken.  Burns threatens the hypnotist, who merely pulls out
% his watch.  (``But I did a <good> job... a <good> job...'')  Burns is won
% over.  Mattingly arrives, his sideburns shaved up almost to the top of his
% head.  But Monty isn't impressed.  ``I thought I told you to trim those
% sideburns!''  He throws him off the team.  (Says Mattingly to himself,
% ``I still like him better than Steinbrenner.'')  Monty gives an inspiring
% non-speech to his players, who rush onto the field.  All except Homer, since
% Darryl Strawberry is suited up for the game.
%
% Lisa and Bart taunt Strawberry with the infamous ``Darryl...'' chant.
% Marge scolds the kids, but Lisa explains that they're professional athletes,
% ``It rolls right off their backs.''  Darryl Strawberry sheds a tear.
%
% The peanuts vendor appears and throws his wares haphazardly about.  One
% bag land on the field, another in the parking lot.
%
% Monty asks Smithers to massage his brain when he realizes that it's his
% managerial skills which will have to save the day.  He orders Strawberry
% to hit a home run.  And he does.  (``I told him to do that.'')
%
% Marge videotapes Homer on the bench, but when Homer reaches down to scratch
% himself in that place baseball players (and Roseanne Arnold) always
% scratch themselves, Marge quickly turns the camera away.  ``Children, tell
% me when your father stops scratching himself.''  Time passes.  ``Kids?''
% Bart replies, ``We'll tell you, Mom.''
%
% The game is tied, it's the bottom of the ninth, the bases are loaded,
% there are two outs, and Strawberry is due to bat.  Even though Darryl
% has hit nine home runs, Burns sends him to the showers because Strawberry
% and the pitcher are both left-handed.  (``It's called playing the
% percentages.'')  He sends Homer, a righty, to the plate instead.  Burns
% reviews the signals with Homer.  Burns' explanation goes on and on, and
% Homer's mind wanders.  ``I wish I was home with a big bag of potato
% chips.  Mmm... potato chips...''
%
% Homer steps to the plate.  Marge and the kids cheer.  Everyone else boos.
% Monty goes into a totally bizarre sequence of signs from the third base
% coach's box, and while Homer merely stares, confused, the pitch hits him
% in the head, knocking him unconscious.  But the good news, is that by
% getting hit by the pitch, Homer wins the game.  ``I guess he'll be happy
% when he comes to,'' notes Marge.  The runner from third has to push
% Homer's body aside to step on the plate.  The team carry Homer's unconscious
% body off the field on their shoulders.
%
% Everybody is gathered together for a team picture.
%
% [End of Act Three]
%
% The scene, a baseball stadium.  The picture fades to black-and-white, and
% acquires the streaks and graininess of an old movie.  Terry Cashman sings
% ``Talkin' Baseball'', but with new lyrics suited to the episode.
%
% Instead of ``Shhh...'', we hear the crack of a bat.
% The Gracie theme is played by a stadium organ.
%
% The Twentieth Century Fox logo is unchanged.
