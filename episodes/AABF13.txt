Couch:          It's role-reversal time.  Bart and Lisa, as bigger, adult
                versions of themselves run to the couch.  They are followed by
                Homer (carrying a Maggie doll) and Marge, who are now the
                kids.  Homer tries to pick up the TV remote, but Lisa slaps
                his wrist.

Don Del Grande:
   ... Maggie is eating with her hands?
   ... either Springfield is more than 2200 miles from Atlanta, or Homer drove
       the wrong way for a while?
   ... somehow, Homer managed to drive 220 miles an hour, if he drove 2200
       miles in 10 hours?

       is less than the 72-oz. steak he rejected as too small.)

Matt Rose:
   ... that the giant steaks were perfectly round in shape?

Evan Ross:
   ... Lisa refers to "sub sandwiches" which means she uses a Northern
       dialect?

*  If the Slaughterhouse just opened, why is it such a big deal that only two

   Slaughterhouse has other locations, and it's just the Springfield one that
   just opened." -- Ed.]  {jg2}

   steak.  {rdb}

=  Red blinks while he's dead.  [See "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]  {bc}

*  How did Homer turn the truck on the first time he got in?  The most logical
   thing is that Red had the keys with him.  If someone took them when he
   died, I don't think that someone would put them on the truck.  {jv}

+  I doubt Marge would let Bart leave with Homer if he had school that week.
   (Note that in "Lard of the Dance (5F20)" that she didn't know Bart was with
   Homer.  Here, she saw him leave.)  {bjr}

   three days.  (That must have been one fast post office.)  {nmd}

   one before, but in 2F08, Homer says he's tired of eating hoagies.  {ddg}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Homer acts like a boor, goes on another "wacky" adventure,
   and somehow things work out.  I did like the subplot: it was similar in
   spirit to the "egg" subplot from "Sunday Cruddy Sunday," but on the whole
   more successful.  (The scenes with Milhouse and, later, the Jehovah's
   Witnesses were definitely the funniest of the episode).  But in the end,
   this episode was harmless and forgettable.  (C)

Miranda Buckle:  I loved this episode!!  I was squealing with disgust in the
   scene at the slaughterhouse, and my favorite quick joke was the 2001
   reference with the auto-driver thingey.  I was also chuckling at how the
   folks at the slaughterhouse handled Red's death, you know, "He's not
   breathing!!  Aren't people supposed to breathe?!"  I also really liked the
   whole sequence when Marge waited for someone to ring the doorbell!  And
   that guy who never sells anything has been appearing a lot recently, hasn't
   he?  The plot was wacky and unpredictable, and the humor was over the top.
   (A+)

Ellen Cohen:  Slightly ho-hum, even by MY standards.  There were some funny
   moments, especially the "whoop-tushy" line and the whole automatic truck
   driving thing ... but other than that, I've seen better.  On the other
   hand, I've seen worse as well.  I got more laughs from "Futurama".  (B)

Ben Collins:  Boy, this episode sucks.  It's the worst force-fed display of
   Jerkass Homer ever, even worse than "Kidney Trouble."  Not even the Homer
   in episodes like "Make Room for Lisa" and "I'm With Cupid" would take
   pleasure in pursuing a little boy with a truck or abandoning his wife.  The
   episode also suffers from a bad case of Recycled Gag Syndrome, almost all
   of them from episodes this season.  The subplot couldn't be more stupid,
   pointless and meaningless. "Maximum Homerdrive" fails to deliver.  (D-)

Nathan M. DeHoff:  Yes, it was yet another "Homer has a wacky adventure"
   episode, with an unrelated Marge and Lisa subplot to eat up some time.  On
   the face of it, it doesn't sound like a very good episode.  I actually
   enjoyed this one, though.  The plot was silly, but it flowed smoothly, and
   the coincidences that occurred were so ridiculous as to be funny.  Homer's
   motivation was also somewhat nobler than much of what we've seen in the
   past (and it wasn't really his fault that Red died).  The subplot had the
   potential to be boring, but it was saved from this fate by the appearance
   of Señor Ding-Dong and the Jehovah's Witness bit (quite possibly the
   funniest scene in the episode).  There were some dull parts, and Bart
   didn't do as much as he could have, but, as far as "Homer has a wacky
   adventure" plots go, this one was pretty good.  (B+)

Yuri Dieujuste:  Tonight's episode was decent plot-wise, but it was seriously
   lacking in humour.  IMHO, there were no funny areas of the story line.
   Marge's subplot, unlike Make Room for Lisa, was poorly crafted.
   Thankfully, Futurama was better.  (D+)

Jordan Eisenberg:  Kinda' boring.  Since I'm getting used to the idea of The
   Simpsons using formulaic plots and wacky premises, naturally an episode
   would have to come along that's even more disturbing.  The way Red's death
   was handled was so dark it made me cringe, and the way Homer treated Marge
   crossed the line from Everyday Asshole Homer to Cartoonish-Super-Asshole
   Homer.  Some nice jokes and incidental dialogue saved it from complete
   pointlessness, as always.  Other good points are that there were no real
   slow parts, and not too many recycled jokes.  But I didn't truly hate Gil
   until now.  (C-)

Curtis Gibby:  {Double sigh}  I really try to ignore the nay-sayers here who
   tell us that season ten is all the same crap.  [...] The plot was
   horrible-- just another zany Homer-fest.  (Yeah, I know ... all that crap
   about giving me hundreds of hours of quality entertainment ... who am I to
   complain?)  Anyway, I don't think this episode was quite as bad as "Kidney
   Trouble"-- more on the level of "Screaming Yellow Honkers."  Subpar for
   this season, horrible for the series.  (D+)

Andrew Gill:  Can't we have a simple bonding episode where bonding actually
   occurs? The entire episode was almost entirely zaniness, and just left me
   feeling flat.  Can't we have one episode where the laws of physics are
   observed from beginning to end?  I hate to do this, but I'm giving this
   episode my standard grade for non-effort:  (F)

Joe Green:  Despite occasional funny bits (the Jehovah's Witnesses scene was
   the only one I laughed really hard at), the episode suffered from excessive
   "Homer-centricity" (again), a pointless Marge and Lisa subplot (again) and
   unnecessary plot twists (again).  Aside from that, it sadly reflects the
   fact that OFF is losing touch with its wryly satirical roots and the
   characters are becoming unlikable parodies of themselves.  (C-)

Darrel Jones:  I thought the first two acts were about average for the series,
   but Act Three picked it up.  I really loved Homer vs. the other truckers,
   the codes were good for a laugh, and Homer's "trip home" had me LOL.  Plus
   the ending (with Señor Ding-Dong) was fantastically silly.  (B+)

Ondre Lombard:  I have sort of a love-hate opinion of this episode.  There
   were gags here that made me laugh out loud for a change (who knows how well
   they'll stand in time, though) and then there were jokes that fell really
   flat.  For the most part, I preferred the doorbell subplot to the nonsense
   with trucker Homer, and Homer's story is set up with a grossly carried away
   sequence of gags related to cruelty to livestock (the whole tastelessly
   inhumane slaughter joke got old quick).  By now, I get the impression that
   the staff believes the show can go on as long as they can keep coming up
   with more inane jobs for Homer to undertake.  While the doorbell subplot
   provided this episode with some strength, it's still a weak and uneven  (C)

Patrick McGovern:  I think this was a satire, actually.  Why?  Notice the
   "little things". Marge saying "You're always going on these adventures!",
   and Homer's out-of-control jerkass things were all plays on how Homer's
   character was "deteriorating".  Why does this work and Homer to the Max
   doesn't?  Because it's subtle.  So subtle that many people mistook it for
   true jerkassness.  I don't know what that says about Homer's character this
   season or the quality of the satire.  [...] While it's certainly not the
   best thing I've seen, or not even this season, I thought it was subtly
   clever and most importantly-funny.  (B+)

Abhi Ray:  This episode was nearly abominable.  Homer being a trucker has to
   be the dumbest most inane job hat he's had yet.  Is there anything funny
   about this premise? Hardly.  The setup with the slaughterhouse was too dark
   to be funny.  The climax with the truckers chasing Homer for squealing
   about their scam was kinda good, as well as the conclusion to the doorbell
   subplot and saves this episode from an even lower grade.  Still, Maximum
   Homerdrive was full of unSimpsonesque jokes and an unSimpsonesque story,
   making this the 10th worst episode of all time.  (D+)

Matt Rose:  Typical of later-season Swartzwelder material in that the humor
   was lacking but we got to see some nice Homer-Bart bonding, which was about
   the only thing really redeeming about it.  Not much to laugh at; they can't
   seem to progress beyond the most obvious gag anymore, and it's very very
   sad.  This "Homer gets into some crazy crazy job" was getting tiresome last
   season and yet it's still being rehashed over and over.  The subplot with
   the whole doorbell thing was a snooze.  Even Futurama was disappointing -
   has Groening lost his touch completely?  Half-grade deduction for using a
   Spice Girls song - SHAME ON YOU STAFF!  (C-)

Evan Ross:  Eh.  This episode is following the trend of late, good ideas but a
   weak follow-through.  Some jokes were pretty good, but others were just not
   the kind we get used to on the Simpsons.  The entire deal with Homer just
   getting up and going, along with Marge not trying to stop him, made this
   episode feel forced and rigid.  "Futurama" needed a strong lead-in, and
   this ep. couldn't do it.  (C+)

Eric Sansoni:  There was a good balance of screentime among the characters,
   very few jaw-dropping bad jokes, and lots of decent ones in "Maximum
   Homerdrive."  The characterization had more thought behind it than usual
   for this season.  The cross-country trip provided some interesting visuals,
   and the obligatory appearance of everyone in the town happened for a fairly
   good reason this time. Up against Futurama, the original Matt Groening show
   held up surprisingly well for me tonight.  While not nearly as smoothly
   plotted as Futurama, it was just about as funny.  (B)

Simon Treanor:  This episode was quite similar to "Sunday Cruddy Sunday",
   particularly in subplot.  Unfortunately though, it wasn't as good.  There
   were some great jokes, and the "Slaughterhouse" restaurant was pretty
   funny, but it was just another Homer-adventure episode, and Homer's
   behavior was as bad as people say.  (C+)

Javier Vera:  This episode was simply the typical above-average episode from
   the last seasons, the plot was original, yet it needed a little work.
   There were some hilarious moments, i.e. no one ringing at Marge's bell.
   The sub-plot was one of the very best I've seen lastly.  In general, the
   episode was good, but it could have been more better if the writers would
   have work more on the main plot, the sub-plot being better than the main
   plot.  (B)

Yours Truly:  A ho-hum episode, neither as gratingly unfunny nor memorably
   hilarious.  (Or for that matter, all that memorable.)  The restaurant
   opening was the best part, with the remainder of the show being too zany
   for my taste.  As with "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday (AABF08)," Marge and Lisa
   have a quiet adventure of their own while the boys are out of town, and
   like that show it doesn't really go anywhere.  (C)

>> Musical References

Darrel Jones:  "Wannabe" by the Spice Girls played on Homer's radio.


Mary Ceol:  "12 Bar Blues" by NRBQ was playing in the diner where Homer and
   Bart ate.


>> Writer Hunt

Jordan Eisenberg rails:  Why is John Swartzwelder writing so many episodes
   this year?  He's probably one of the least favorite writers around here,
   yet this is his fourth episode this year.  But then again, Mike Scully is
   an unpopular Executive Producer and he's going to become the longest-
   running one the show's ever had next year.  It's criminal, I tell ya!


Eric Sansoni:  Actually, Swartzwelder has consistently written 4 or 5 episodes
   per year throughout the series' run.  He's actually credited as writer for
   almost 20% of the series, probably twice as much as the next most prolific
   writer.  I think it just feels like he's written more this time, because
   the whole season has been so lacking in content, it feels like it's barely
   started yet.

   BTW, I don't think Swartzwelder is particularly unpopular.  A lot of fans
   passing through seem to mention him as a favorite writer.  I think this is
   just because he's written so many episodes.  Somewhere in there he's bound
   to have written some of anyone's favorite episodes, so he is more likely to
   be named a favorite writer than someone who's only written 3 or 4 episodes.


Ondre Lombard:  Sometimes lately I don't like Swartzwelder because he can
   create a bad episode with some good elements.  I'd rather good jokes and
   good ideas go towards a decent episode instead of a lame one.


>> Those Immortal Threads

 - Where is Springfield?

Andrew Gill:  Springfield is more than 2100 miles from Atlanta.


John Jensen:  They started off with 3 days to get to Atlanta (later confirmed
   as 2,200 miles).  That would put Springfield in the far Northwest of the
   US, Like Washington or Oregon.


Ted J. Mills notes:  Maybe Springfield is much less than 2100 miles from
   Atlanta, but Homer spent two days driving in the wrong direction.


>> Lisa:  Been there, done that

Mike Smith:  "Maximum Homerdrive" is the first time an episode title parodied
   a title that is OFF-related, since it's a parody of "Maximum Overdrive', an
   1986 film written and directed by Stephen King (From his short story,
   "Trucks").  What is OFF-related, of course, that Yeardley Smith (who voiced
   Lisa) co-starred in that movie (And, what bad memories of THAT!)  The
   movie, BTW, is remade as a 1997 made-for-cable movie called, simply,
   "Trucks"!

   [Wait ... someone *remade* "Maximum Overdrive"?  I'm speechless -- Ed.]


Matt Rose adds:  "Maximum Homerdrive" is obviously referring to "Maximum
   Overdrive", a dreadful 1986 film directed by Stephen King and starring
   Emilio Estevez, Laura Harrington, Pat Hingle, and a relatively unknown 22
   year-old actress named Yeardley Smith (yes, the same one).  In this movie,
   a comet causes machines to come to life and terrorize the human race.  The
   main focus is on a group of travelers who all seek refuge at a truck stop
   in North Carolina.  Yeardley plays a *very* annoying young newlywed
   character with a foul mouth (quite amusing :).  If you like Yeardley (or
   maybe if you like AC/DC), you might want to see it.  Otherwise, avoid this
   film like the plague.  Come to think of it, I'm actually quite disappointed
   that this episode failed to make reference to this movie in any other way,
   seeing how there is a blatantly obvious opportunity to do so.  Perhaps
   Yeardley begged them not to?


>> Now that's good eatin'!

Are you hungry?  I mean *really* hungry?  John Jensen has the place for you:
   There really is a restaurant in Texas called the Big Texan that has a
   contest for eating a big steak dinner.  But it's the 72 oz. one that Homer
   scoffed at (not a 16 pounder!)  Eat the whole thing in an hour and it's
   free.  FAIL and it's about $50.  Amarillo, Texas, for those interested.
   Billboards all the way across the state.  Or ask any trucker ANYWHERE.  I
   mean from any state.  It's known across the country.


Paul Tomko:  The billboards are in Oklahoma as well.  The say things like
   "Only 400 more miles to the Big Texan."  They might even be as far away as
   Missouri.  I don't recall at the moment.


>> A blink before dying

Todd P. Emerson proposes two theories of how Red could blink after dying:  1.
   Post-mortem reflex.  Sometimes certain  muscles can contract and/or expand
   after death, which would explain the blink.  And after hearing stories my
   grandfather would tell me about one of his earlier jobs, there is NO WAY in
   hell that I would ever work at a job that required handling recently-dead
   bodies.  The embalming process alone can produce some interesting bodily
   contortions, and I'll have none of that!

   2.  Red's blink might have been a joke about how some actors trying to play
   "dead" can't seem to help blinking, twitching, or breathing. Nothing ruins
   a good death scene like seeing an actor trying not to look like he's
   breathing!


>> Wish you were her

John Jensen tells us about Bettie Page:  Believe it or not, she is to date the
   most popular pinup girl of all time.  You think a lot of gas stations have
   calendars of Pam Anderson?  She has nothing on Bettie Page.  And since
   Playboy made her career, they are constantly going back to the well for
   more.


>> "Wait!  Maybe we don't have all the answers"

Yuri Dieujuste:  Jehovah's Witnesses are an individual religion that is found
   usually in large cities.  Some basic things about their religion are that
   they do not celebrate birthdays, they use a special version of the Bible
   that has words such as priest erased, and they do not believe in religious
   hierarchy (priest, bishop, pope).

   I must agree with them that they do not have all of the answers.  No
   religion ever does!


David Brunt adds:  They also don't believe in blood transfusions, organ
   replacements, etc.


>> Well, at least they're not as annoying as Cabbage Patch Dolls

Benjamin Robinson explains the truckers' new scam:  After the drivers figured
   their scam was exposed, they brainstorm for ideas on how to make a living.
   One of them suggests smuggling Beanie Babies, which isn't a bad choice.
   For those of you who just got out of their cryogenic chambers yesterday,
   Beanie Babies are small, floppy, stuffed dolls with cutsie names like
   Peanuts the elephant, Harvey the wonder hamster, and Weasel the major
   network television executive.  By themselves, the dolls aren't that
   remarkable, but each doll in the lineup is made only for a limited time.
   Once that model's run is over, no more are produced.  The idea was to keep
   children interested enough to check back with the toy store periodically,
   and it worked [*].  If anything, it worked too well.  Adults began picking
   up and hoarding the toys, rare examples of which were valued by collectors
   in the thousands of dollars.  The scent of money even attracted thieves who
   stole the toys right out of the stores.  In my area, a flea market guard
   was jumped by two men with hammers who beat him and stole a quantity of
   Beanie Babies.  Kind of makes you wish your kids would go back to Barbies
   and GI Joes.

   [*] The "limited run" idea has worked before, with Matchbox and Hot Wheels
   toy cars.  The number of models sold at a given time is fixed. When a new
   car is made, and old one is retired from the line.  Adults also collect
   both makes of toy cars, but not with the ferocity of Beanie Baby Boosters.


Joe Klemm adds:  Bootlegging them would be impossible since many different
   companies are making their own bean bag stuffed animals and counterfeit
   versions of the Ty Beanies are sometimes easy to spot if you read a Beanie
   guide.


Todd Sempel:  They may be easy to spot, but Beanie Babies still get
   bootlegged.

   [Since this was written, the Ty corporation has shut down production of
   Beanie Babies altogether -- Ed.]


>> Maximum Car Watch

Courtesy Benjamin Robinson:  The coroner's hearse is a 1959 Cadillac.
   (Cadillac doesn't make station wagons, so all Caddy hearses are actually
   modified by an outside company.)  Appropriately, the cops sometimes refer
   to the coroner's hearse as a "meat wagon."

   Among other cars at the drive-in, Homer blocks the view of a Volkswagen Old
   Beetle.

   Señor Ding-Dong's van is a Chevy, at least according to him.

   I'm not really up on my big rigs, so I can't say of the "Red Rascal" is a
   Mack truck or not, but Red Barclay's Mack cap suggests that it is.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Honk If You're Homer

   Pig!"  [Yes, it's a Yeardley Smith reference ...]


Jordan Eisenberg's Alterna-alterna-alterna-title:  "The Little Simpson That
   Could"


John Jensen (who is a trucker in real life):  There aren't that many teamster
   jobs around anymore.  Nearly all are LTL, not truckload.  (Yellow, ABF,
   Roadway are the big 3).  And they are making $20 an hour, not 40.  But
   still nothing to sneeze at.


Charles McNulty:  Karen Carpenter's doorbell chimed the first six notes of
   "We've Only Just Begun."  I wonder if hers was also installed by Señor Ding

Homer:	Wow, it's even more wonderful than Lisa said.

Marge:	How clever.  The kids' menu is on the beak.

% In another part of the restaurant, Burns picks a cow to dine upon.

% changes his mind after the cowhand kills it.  Finally, Mr. Burns 
% decides that what he really wants is a glass of milk.
%
% Homer, too, is ready to order something.

Homer:	Wait a minute.  Is this the biggest steak you've got?  
	Seventy-two ounces?  I thought this was supposed to be a 
	steakhouse, not a little girly, underpantsy, pink doily, 
	tea-party place.
Waiter:	Well, there is one steak that's available only by special 
	request.  We call it, uh, Sir Loin-A-Lot.  It's, uh, the 
	size of a boogie board.
Homer:	Ooh, I'll have that one.  And to drink ... meatballs.
Waiter:	Very good, sir.  [rings a triangle] Ladies and gentlemen,

% Lacking the proper tools, Marge instead yanks out a wire from the 
% doorbell's innards.  Bad move -- the playing gets louder and faster, 
% until it wakens the neighborhood.
%
% On Highway 7, a fleet of big rigs closes in on Homer and Bart.

Homer:	[seeing the trucks in his rear-view mirror] Look, son.  
	It's one of Nature's most beautiful sights -- the convoy.
	[one of the trucks accelerates, and hits Homer's trailer]
Bart:	He hit us!
Homer:	Oh, I should have known.  They're hazing us, to initiate 
	us into the truckers' fraternity.
	[the truck is hit again]
	[yelling out the window] Thank you sir, may I have 
	another?
	[the truck is hit again]
Bart:	Dad, they're trying to kill us.
Homer:	Oh, why do all my trips end like this?
-- Don't look at us, "Maximum Homerdrive"

% A trucker jumps on to Homer's hood.  Homer repels him with a blast 
% of water from the windshield washers.  Another man leaps onto 
% Homer's trailer, and tries to cut a tire with a knife.  The blade 
% bounces off the rubber, and the man drops the knife on the road.  
% For a second, it looks like Homer has lost his pursuers, but it 
% turns out that several truckers have blocked the road ahead.
%
% Homer is determined, as a favor for Red, to get his load through.  
% It's time for a showdown.

Homer:		We'll get through that barrier somehow.  Old Blinky 
		here will find a way.  [drives at top speed towards 
		the barricade]
Autodrive:	I'm afraid I can't let you do this, Red.  The risk 
		is unacceptable.
Homer:		I'm not Red, I'm Homer.
Autodrive:	Gotta go.  [it ejects from the cab and parachutes to 
		safety]
Homer:		Aaah!
Bart:		Dad, do something.
Homer:		[buckles up]
Bart:		Something better.

% Homer brakes and steers sharply.  The truck starts to jackknife, and 
% then launches into the air, doing a graceful barrel roll over the 
% blockade of trucks before landing on its wheels.
%
% The other truckers, needless to say, are impressed.

Trucker 3:	Now that man is a genuine steel-belted, gear-jamming 
		rig jockey.
Trucker 5:	Mmm, that's a fact
Trucker 6:	Boy, howdy.
Trucker 4:	You can say that again.
Trucker 7:	Yup.
Trucker 4:	You know boys, I've been thinking.  Maybe it's time 
		we ditched the high tech gizmos and went back to 
		driving like our daddies did.
Trucker 5:	Drunk?
Trucker 4:	No, no, no.  Using our hands and our wits.  Yeah, 
		sure, it's hard work, and it's lonely as hell, but 
		it has meaning and dignity.  Huh?  What do you say?
		[long pause from the other men]
Trucker 3:	Nah.  Let's just find some other scam.
Trucker 5:	Hey, how about bootlegging Beanie Babies?
Trucker 7:	Sounds good to me.
Trucker 6:	I like that.

% The boys roll into Atlanta, delivering Red Barclay's shipment of 
% artichokes and migrant workers on schedule.  Mission accomplished.  
% The dockmaster asks Homer where Red is, and Homer says he last saw 
% Red in a big plastic bag.  "Yeah, that sounds like Red, all right," 
% says the dockmaster, as if this sort of thing frequently happens.

Homer:		Well son, I guess it's time to go home.
Bart:		Any thoughts on how we're going to get there?
Homer:		No, but I'm sure the good Lord will provide.
		[in the background, an engineer argues with a man in 
		a military uniform]
Engineer:	Are you crazy?  I'm not driving a trainload of 
		napalm to Springfield.  [throws his cap on the 
		ground and walks off]
Homer:		[heavenward] Thank you.  [picks up the cap and 
		boards the train]

% Things in Springfield aren't going so smoothly.  The doorbell is 
% continuing to play.  An irate, sleep-deprived, mob of townspeople 
% has gathered at Marge's doorstep.

Marge:		I'm really sorry everybody, but I've tried 
		everything.  I'm afraid we're just going to have to 
		learn to live with it.
Wiggum:		No, no, no.  No dice.  [draws his gun] All right, 
		chimey, this time, the bell tolls for thee.  [aims 
		at the doorbell.  From offscreen, a whip cracks 
		Wiggum's gun out of his hand] Huh?
		[The camera pans to reveal Señor Ding-Dong, standing 
		on top of a van]
Bumblebee Guy:	¡Ay, ay, ay -- Señor Ding-Dong!
Lisa:		I thought you were just a marketing gimmick.
Ding-Dong:	There was a time when that was true, but now, I am 
		so much more.  [cracks the whip at the doorbell, 
		silencing it.  The crowd cheers]
Marge:		Oh, my!  Gracias, Señor.
Ding-Dong:	Denada.  If you ever need me, just ... ring.  [gets 
		in his van, and tries to start the motor.  It 
		doesn't cooperate]
		Does anyone have any jumper cables?  [tries again] 
		Oh, you stinking Chevy.

% Fade to black, as Sr. Ding-Dong rides off into the sunset.  Or sits 
% there at the curb.  Whatever.
