    first column reads...

        I did see Elvis.

    You hafta freeze-frame it.  It flashes by real fast.

    Note Bart's contorted face when he says `ro' in `robot'.
    This is actually a regular feature of Bart's animation.

> Quotes and scene summary
===============================================================================
% At night, Bart and Homer walk down the streets of downtown Springfield.
% Bart carries the head of a statue.  Homer reassures Bart, ``You know, Bart,
% when I was your age, I pulled a few boners.  But I think you'll find that
% people are pretty decent if you give them half a---''  They turn the
% corner and find an angry, torch-wielding mob.   Running out of places
% to run, Homer and Bart run onto the town square, which sports a headless
% statue.  Each tells the other to go, but both refuse to leave the other
% to die.  ``We'll die together, like a father and son should.''
%
% The mob closes in, and Bart climbs to the top of the statue.

Bart:   Murderous mob, I beg you to spare our lives, at least until you've
        heard the story of how we ended up with the head of our belov\'ed
        town founder.
Barney: How long will this story take?
Bart:   Uh... About twenty-three minutes and five seconds.
-- Does that include commercials?  ``The Telltale Head''

% They agree. It all started Sunday morning.  Marge calls the kids downstairs.
% The three kids come down, all dressed adorably.  (Bart uses the banister
% express.)  Marge gives them a quick inspection.

Marge: Bart, assume the position.
Bart:  [turns and leans against the wall, legs spread]
Marge: [frisks Bart]
-- Leaving for church, ``The Telltale Head''

% Marge finds a slingshot and a Radioactive Man comic.  Meanwhile, Homer
% hops nervously on the couch, watching football.  His team fumbles,
% and the opponents recover it for a touchdown.  Marge is upset that Homer
% wagered $50 on the game, but Homer insists it's not gambling.  The
% win is guaranteed.  (His team fumbles again, recovered for a touchdown.)
%
% In the car, Marge politely complains/scolds that she always has to drag
% everyone to church.  Homer tunes the football game on the car radio.
% When his team scores, he honks the horn and flashes his headlights.
% In the back seat, Bart also grins widely, listening to his Walkman.

Announcer: This could be the most remarkable comeback since Lazarus rose
           from the dead!
Homer:     Laza-who?
-- Driving to church, ``The Telltale Head''

% They arrive at the First Church of Springfield.  Bart dances silently
% to the music.

Marge: [confiscates Bart's personal stereo]
       Were you going to listen to rock music in Sunday School?
Bart:  Maybe.
Marge: Can you believe this, Homer? ... Homer?  Homer?
Homer: [in the car, bashes his head on the steering wheel in frustration]
Marge: [goes to the car]  Homer, were you planning on sitting in the
       car until the [football] game is over?
Homer: Maybe.
-- Great minds think alike, ``The Telltale Head''

% Marge tosses the radio into the car, and Homer pockets it.
%
% In Sunday School, Miss Allbright tries to explain to the kids that
% animals don't go to heaven.  Heaven is for people.

Milhouse:  Will there be cavemen in heaven?
Sunday School Teacher:  Certainly not!
Bart: Uh, ma'am?  What if you're a really good person, but
      you get into a really, really bad fight and your leg gets
      gangrene and it has to be amputated.  Will it be waiting for
      you in heaven?
SST:  For the last time, Bart, yes!
-- Playing by the rules, ``The Telltale Head''

% Meanwhile, Reverend Lovejoy gives his sermon, titled, ``Gambling:  The
% Eighth Deadly Sin.''  Slowly push in on Homer in the congregation, wearing
% Bart's headphones and listening to the football game.  The audio changes
% to the play-by-play.  Reverend Lovejoy's arm motions serve to illustrate
% the football action.  Homer's team sets up for a game-winning field goal.
% Homer and the congregation pray.  The kick is good, and Homer stands up,
% yelling, ``It's good!  It's good!''  All eyes turn to him.  ``It's good...
% to see you all in church.''
%
% Meanwhile, Miss Allbright is completely exasperated.

Sunday School Teacher:  [very tired]  The ventriloquist goes to heaven,
      but the dummy doesn't.
Bart: [raises his hand]  Ooh-ooh-ooh!  Me!
SST:  Bart?
Bart: What about a robot with a human brain?
SST:  [at the breaking point] I don't know!  All these questions!
      Is a little blind faith too much to ask!?!
-- ``The Telltale Head''

% The service has ended.  In the car, Marge scolds Homer, then...

Marge: Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in Sunday School today?
Lisa:  The answers to deep theological questions.
Bart:  Yeah, among other things, apes can't get into heaven.
Homer: What?  Those cute little monkeys?  That's terrible.
       Who told you that?
Bart:  Our teacher.
Homer: I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but
       what about those really smart ones who live among us?
       Who roller-skate and smoke cigars?
-- And work in nuclear power plants, ``The Telltale Head''

% The car stops for a traffic light in front of a movie theater.

Bart:  Cool, man, Space Mutants 4.  Let me off!  Let me off!
Marge: No way, Jose.
Homer: Marge, they're only space mutants.
Marge: Uh uh.  I know what those movies are like.
       Killing innocent people, eating human flesh.
       You'll just get a lot of bad ideas.
-- ``The Telltale Head''

% At home, Bart approaches Homer, who is resting on the couch.  Bart asks
% for $5, and Homer winkingly hopes Bart doesn't spend it on a certain
% movie.  Bart goes upstairs, undresses in the hallway, enter his room
% naked, puts on his shirt and shorts, grabs his skateboard, and swings
% out the window, without once breaking stride.
%
% Bart skateboards cheerily to the theater, where he is greeted by Jimbo
% and Kerny, the worst kids in town.  Momentarily distracted, Bart
% crashes into a lamppost.  ``Didn't hurt.''  Dolph pops his head out
% the side door of the theater.  ``The coast is clear.''

Bart:  You guys are sneaking in?
Kerny: Yeah, only saps pay to see movies.
Jimbo: Hey, Bart, come on!
Bart:  But sneaking into movies is practically stealing, man.
Kerny: Practically?
Jimbo: It <is> stealing.
Bart:  Well, okay.  I just wanted to make sure we aren't deluding ourselves.
-- An irrefutable argument, ``The Telltale Head''

% [End of Act One.  Time: 8:04]
%
% The movie plays to a nearly empty theater.  The Space Mutant makes its
% surprise appearance.  At the same time, the usher grabs our quartet and
% tosses them out.  Says Dolph, ``We'll take our business elsewhere.''
%
% The quartet go into the Kwik-E-Mart, where Bart buys some Squishees with
% the $5 Homer gave him.  While Apu fills the order, the others shoplift
% like mad.  Bart pays for the drinks, and finds that the guys have left.
% He finds them in the parking lot, enjoying their booty.  They thank him
% for covering for them while they used the ``five finger discount''.
%
% They go into the town square, where Dolph, Kerny, and Jimbo throw rocks
% at the statue of Jebediah Springfield, town founder.  Jimbo hands Bart
% a rock, and he throws it.  A local shopkeeper chases them away.
%
% The gang lie on their backs, admiring the clouds.  Various shapes seen
% include a cherry bomb, a guy with a switchblade stuck in his back,
% a schoolbus going over a cliff with kids screaming, and a headless
% statue of Jebediah Springfield.  Jimbo, Kerny, and Dolph think it'd
% be cool if someone cut his head off.  When Bart leaps to Jebediah's
% defense, the other razz him.  ``Man, I thought you were cool.''  Bart
% trudges off.
%
% Bart pays another visit to the statue, and gets an idea.
%
% Back at home...

Homer: [reading The Bowl Earth Catalog]
       Wow, look at these bowling balls, Maggie!
       Can you think of a better way for Daddy to spend his
       hard-won fifty bucks?
       [turns the page]
       Gasp!  Now I've seen everything.
       Black, marbleized with a liquid center.  The Stealth Bowler.
       The pins don't know what hit 'em.
-- ``The Telltale Head''

% Bart comes home.

Bart:  I was wondering.  How important is it to be popular?
Homer: I'm glad you asked, son.  Being popular is the most important thing
       in the world!
Bart:  Like, sometimes, you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad,
       so other kids will like you better?
Homer: You're not talking about killing anyone, are you?
Bart:  No.
Homer: Are you!
Bart:  No!
Homer: Then run along, you little scamp!  [musses Bart's hair]
       A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
-- ``The Telltale Head''

A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
-- Homer, ``The Telltale Head''

% At 3am, Bart, clad in black ninja garb, sneaks out of his room.  He
% accidentally steps on the cat, but grabs it and covers its mouth before
% it can scream out.  He release the cat outside and climbs out the window.
% Bart reaches the town square and unsheathes...  A hacksaw!  He climbs
% the statue and saws off the head.  We pull back from the town square
% as the sawing continues.  (*clunk*)  ``What have I done?''
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:33]
%
% In bed, Bart wakes up and is startled by the head next to him.  Marge
% calls him down to breakfast, where Homer and Lisa enjoy their morning
% meal.

Homer: Ooh, look at this one!  The Hammer of Thor!
       It will sends your pins to... Valhalla?  Lisa?
Lisa:  Valhalla is where Vikings go when they die.
Homer: Ooh, that's some ball!
-- Reading The Bowl Earth Catalog, ``The Telltale Head''

% Bart arrives, carrying a large knapsack containing something heavy and
% metallic.  The radio reports the ``act of senseless vandalism'', and
% all are shocked.

We have no witnesses, no suspects, no leads.
If anyone has any information, please dial `O' and ask for the police.
That number again:  `O'.
-- Chief Wiggum's press conference, ``The Telltale Head''

% Even the reporter is unable to hold back his tears.
% Bart asks why everyone's so excited.  It's just a statue.

Just a statue?  Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue?
Is the Leaning Tower of Pizza [sic] just a statue?
-- Homer, ``The Telltale Head''

% Bart hears the school bus and says, ``Come on, Lis.''  Lisa sadly
% leave for school.
%
% In the tavern, Moe tries to get everyone to cheer up.  Barney asks
% for a beer, ``And make sure there's a head on it.''  Moe thinks this
% is funny.  No one else does.
%
% At the Springfield Retirement Home, Grampa Simpson joins the outrage.
%
% Bart pays a visit to Jimbo, Kerny and Dolph, who say they wish they could
% see the guy who cut off the head.  Bart unzips his knapsack.  Kerny
% continues, ``We'd break every bone in his stupid little body!''  Bart
% quickly zips the knapsack shut.  Bart reminds them of their wish from the
% previous day, but Kerny explains, ``That was just cloud talk.''
% Jimbo asks what's in the bag.  Bart hears a voice.  ``It's the head
% of Jebediah Springfield...'' Bart dashes off, past a crowd which has
% formed around the now headless statue.  Bart tries to convince himself
% that the voice is just his imagination.  In the crowd is Monty Burns,
% who breaks down in tears.  Smithers, as always, is by his side.  He holds
% a hanky to Burns' nose.  ``Blow, sir.''  (*honk*)
%
% Bart returns home, and Lisa invites him to watch Krusty the Clown.

There is someone out there in Krusty-Land who has committed an atrocity!
If you know who cut off Jebediah's head, I don't care if it's your brother,
your sister, your daddy, or your mommy, turn him in!
[brightly]  Krusty will send you a free slide whistle,
just like Sideshow Bob's!
-- ``The Telltale Head''

% Bart digs a hole in the backyard and carries on a conversation with the
% head.  The head suggests that a hero can be a young boy who admits his
% mistake.  Bart tosses the head into the hole. ``Yeah, well, I'm a little
% short on courage right now.''  The head asks Bart to think about it.
%
% The rest of the family watch a documentary.

[Caption:  SPRINGFIELD: A CITY HELD HOSTAGE.  DAY ONE  (dramatization)]
Jebediah Obadiah Zachariah Jedediah Springfield, he was.
[A cheesy documentary.  Jebediah chops wood.]
In 1838, along the way, he met a ferocious bear.
[What is obviously a man in a bear costume appears.
 Jebediah discards his axe and wrestles the bear.
 The caption `dramatization' reappears.]
And killed him with his bare hands.  That's B-A-R-E hands.
[Jebediah wins.]
We've recently uncovered evidence that the bear, in fact, probably
killed <him>.
-- ``The Telltale Head''

% Bart appears, with the head.  Homer approaches Bart menacingly.  ``Why?
% You little...''  Bart explains, ``Somehow I got the idea that being
% popular was the most important thing in the world.'' Homer reacts.
% Marge asks, ``Where did you get a ridiculous idea like that!?''  Homer
% nervously asks Marge to take it easy on the boy.  Marge concludes that
% that Homer was more than a little responsible.  Homer leaves with Bart
% to return the ``head thing'' to the authorities.
%
% At night, Bart and Homer walk down the streets of downtown Springfield.
% Bart carries the head of a statue.  Homer reassures Bart, ``You know, Bart,
% when I was your age, I pulled a few boners.  But I think you'll find that
% people are pretty decent if you give them half a---''  They turn the
% corner and find an angry, torch-wielding mob.   Running out of places
% to run, Homer and Bart run onto the town square...
%
% Various mob voices exclaim, ``All right!''  ``We know this part!''
%
% Dissolve back to the present.  Bart concludes, ``If you still want to tear
% apart this young Sunday School student as he stands on the brink of
% salvation, I await your wrath.  But I'd like to add one thing.  It wasn't
% until after I'd removed the head that we realized we were taking our
% heritage for granted.  That's a crime, too.  One I think we are all guilty
% of.''  The crowd is won over.  Says Krusty, ``Somehow, I don't feel like
% killing any more.''  Neither does Ms. Krabappel.
%
% Homer tosses Bart the head, and with a quiet ``Forgive me, sir'', Bart
% replaces it.  The head replies, ``No problem, Bart.''  All are touched.

Burns:    [overcome with emotion]  I love you, Smithers.
Smithers: The feeling is more than mutual, sir.
-- ``The Telltale Head''

% Church bells peal, and the crowd cheers.
