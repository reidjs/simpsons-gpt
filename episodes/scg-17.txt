[========================[Season Seventeen Summary]=========================]

Story cut episodes: All but GABF18, GABF19, GABF17, GABF20, GABF21, GABF22,
                    HABF05, HABF06, HABF13.
Compressed episodes: All but HABF07, HABF08, HABF14.
Expanded episodes: GABF16, HABF08, HABF10, HABF14.
Changed content: HABF08.
Missing credits: HABF01, HABF10, HABF12.
Original breaks: GABF18, GABF19, GABF17, GABF20, GABF21, GABF22, HABF05,
                 HABF06, HABF13.
Altered openings: HABF04, HABF07, HABF08.

Total time cut: 5:11 (5 min 11 sec) (lengthened intro time not counted)
Story time cut: 4:53 (4 min 53 sec)
Total time gained: 10:04 (10 min 4 sec)

Notes: Once again, the TV rating bug is not seen (perhaps it is no longer
       included in the video signal because of the new way Fox broadcasts
       them originally), but the V-chip can still access the ratings. (GABF20
       is marked as TV-14-DL in syndication, even though it was originally
       TV-PG. It's possible that it got switched accidentally, as the higher
       rating matches HABF06.) The XDS production code display is still gone.

       Cuts and compression styles are all over the place this season; about
       half a dozen episodes start compression after the running credits,
       with a similar amount using the season 16 method of starting it
       immediately but ending before each act is over. Fortunately, cuts are
       still less frequent, but some can be large (record-breaking even)!
       Expansion makes a small return as well, along with 2 lengthened intros
       (both of which use components from HABF04, which itself uses a shorter
       opening in syndication, go figure).

       Returning this season for the first time since season 9 (recall that
       this was most frequent in seasons 7 and 8, with one each in 6 and 9,
       for a total of 13) are some original commercial breaks! With a handful
       of exceptions, episodes are originally broadcast with a commercial
       after the opening, and a continuous flow from the third act to the
       credits, but in syndication this is usually reversed, causing trouble
       for special credits, and usually wildly different ways of handling
       them. This season, 9 episodes have the original breaks (see above),
       but it's a pretty boneheaded selection, since a few of them didn't
       need it (no overlapping music or action, even for a fraction of a
       second), while many were more deserving, and in fact, three episodes
       (HABF01/10/12) were just plain butchered, using the season 15 tactic
       of placing a commercial break before the credits (cutting off the
       music) and sticking the standard theme in during them. I don't want to
       know who was calling these shots.

Tidying up: 4/6/09, adjusted HABF05 timing typo (thanks Tim)

       * The establishing shot of Lisa's window (before "this stinks") is
       * shortened a bit, with a slight overlap of the music onto her line.
       * I'm marking it as a big piece of compression, though.


 ~~~~~    ACT II   <0:28>   (0:33)   8:31 / 9:04

         Lisa turns the TV on.
       % In a new shot, head-on, Lisa and Homer watch, and Marge sinks down
       % and tries to sleep, groaning.

       %  Announcer: [vo] Now, Rerun Land takes you back to 1965, with
       %             Bonanza!
       %  Character: See here, Cartwright, your boys have been eatin' my
       %             apples.

       %
       % (They all stand motionless as the theme plays.) As the music
       % continues, we see the Simpsons again. Lisa is smiling and Homer has
       % popcorn now.
       %
       %      Marge: Oh, Lisa, do you really want to watch this?
       %       Lisa: [turns it off] Mom, I think there's a danger *this* time
       %             they might lose the Ponderosa!

         Bart's bed crashes into the room.

       ! Fairly awkward cut, since Lisa wouldn't turn the TV on for no
       ! (narrative) reason, and Homer's popcorn induces a continuity error.
