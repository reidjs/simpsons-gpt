> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Couch:          Vend-A-Couch is there.  Homer inserts a quarter and pushes
                button.  Nothing happens and he pounds saying, "D'oh!"  {hl}

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... Snowball II trapped between the first and second floors?

Dale G. Abersold:
   ... this is the first episode written by Donick Cary?
   ... one of the stain-glass saints is "St. Donickus"?  (Yes, Donick Cary
       wrote a pretty good episode, but I thought sainthood was a posthumous
       honor).

Jesse Burgheimer:
   ... Homer is also pretty bad at "chunking" memory, as noted by his phone
       dialing skills?
   ... Homer is more fearful of his face on the box than he is of the Japanese
       Mr. Sparkle commercial?  (Which was indeed pretty frightening...)

Vince Chan:
   ... church starts before 8:45 AM?
   ... the clock in the library said 4:10?
   ... Homer dialed 19 numbers?
   ... the Leftorium had left handed umbrellas?

Mike Colgan:
   ... the Japanese in this episode is almost 100% accurate?  (As most viewers
       don't know Japanese, this seems trivial, but the Simpsons' production
       team put some research into the dialogue.)  [See "Comments" section for
       more -- Ed.]

Nathan DeHoff:
   ... Moe apparently has his floor back?  (The shot of Moe's didn't actually
       show the floor, but that bar stool must have been standing on
       something.)
   ... Akira said that Mr. Sparkle is "a magnet for food?"  (Kinda like Homer)
   ... the "No Littering" sign at the dump?

Don Del Grande:
   ... apparently, the last Sunday church service is at 9:00?
   ... at the service, Birch Barlow is sitting next to Mrs. Wiggum, and Kirk
       van Houten is sitting next to Milhouse?
   ... when Marge responded to Principal Skinner's problem, she made it sound
       like she didn't know who he was?
   ... in the 1970s, Reverend Lovejoy had brown hair?
   ... the Hokkaido phone book is in English?
   ... Marge calls Reverend Lovejoy "Tim"?
   ... the sign in front of the church doesn't change for a while (a rarity
       with this church)?
   ... "Old Springfield Library" is not only still functioning, it's open
       seven days a week, and it's open from 8 AM until midnight on Sundays?
       (What municipal buildings are open on Sunday mornings?)
   ... the English-speaking employee at the soap plant has a shirt that says
       "Champions of Winning Superb!"?
   ... the zookeeper sounds like Moe?

Curtis Gibby:
   ... Homer hits the "Vend-a-Couch" sign four times before the Vend-a-Couch,
       well, hits him?
   ... Bart laughs at the title of the I&S cartoon?
   ... in the cartoon, the fish's eyes follow the bulge in the stethoscope
       tube?
   ... Maggie is still sleeping when the family arrives home after church?
   ... Reverend Lovejoy has one of those swinging ball sets in his office?
       {click, click, click}  (You know the ones I mean.)
   ... the sign on the bookshelf behind Homer at the library reads "O 507 - O
       518"? (this was episode number 18 in the production run ...)
   ... the "Matsumura Fishworks" text in the video is written in that
       Macintosh system font?
   ... Flanders is standing on an umbrella rack when the hoodlums are riding
       around, and you can see another rack in the background?
   ... the last monkey to attack Lovejoy has a bare butt?  [Which is correct
       for the species -- Ed.]

Jason Hancock:
   ... the unopened Christmas present still under the rotted tree?
   ... the ornament on the rotted tree?
   ... Ned Flanders had thick glasses in the seventies?  (Contrast that to the
       King of the Hill episode that followed [on April 27, 1997, when this
       episode was first aired], where Hank was shown as having thin glasses
       during the time he and Peggy were dating.)
   ... OFF has spaghetti for dinner?
   ... the Lovejoys have a portable tape recorder in their kitchen?
   ... the Lovejoys have a phone in their basement?
   ... the Japanese dialogue is closed-captioned in Japanese?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the weasel talking on the cellular phone at Hollywood in the Itchy and
       Scratchy short?
   ... Snowball II's is in between the downstairs ceiling and the upstairs
       floor?
   ... the Japanese girl wearing blue doesn't have a line on her own in the
       ad?
   ... Homer had Marge in his arms when in Lovejoy's car?
   ... Bart and Lisa skip school just to find Flanders?

Haynes Lee:
   ... Lionel Hutz in congregation (and first time too)?
   ... Dr. Hibbert is wearing his lab coat in church?
   ... the car with left-handed gear-shift Flanders sold to Burns in
       Leftorium?

Ido Lewit:
   ... Homer knows exactly whom to call in Hokkaido?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... even Marge sleeps in church?
   ... the face resembling Homer on the soap box has anime-eyes?
   ... younger Ned's voice sounds no different than it does now?
   ... Maggie has nothing to eat in the dinner scene?
   ... Homer knows how to say "hello" in Japanese?  (Konnichiwa!)

Ryan Mead:
   ... that in "Deaf Comedy Blam," a dog near Scratchy looks like Poochie?

Dallas J. Pesola:
   ... Dr. Nick was in the 'Listen Lady' line?
   ... "Listen Lady" is one of Moe's catch lines, which he uses when talking
       to Marge?
   ... gas is considered a discount at 1/10 cent less then normal price?

Brian Petersen:
   ... according to my DTMF decoder, Homer's long string of touch-tones when
       calling Japan was: 9 6 5 7 1 5 3 6 1 8 9 6 5 7 1 5 3 6 1

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Bart and Lisa must be quiet during an "Itchy & Scratchy" that's all
       about loudness?
   ... the Reverend has a small praying hands statue on his bookshelf?
   ... in the flashback, the Reverend drives a VW Karmann-Ghia into town?
   ... while he's driving he's listening to "Jesus is Just Alright by Me," by
       the Doobie Brothers?
   ... Reverend Lovejoy probably met Mrs. Lovejoy in Springfield, since she is
       not with him when he arrives?
   ... as Homer dials Hokkaido, the librarian nervously runs off?  (I expected
       this to amount to something later, but it never did)
   ... today, Reverend Lovejoy's Karmann-Ghia is considerably more banged up?

Marge Starbrod-Simpson:
   ... the Leftorium is open despite the 4F07 incident?

+  Itchy & Scratchy, part of Krusty's show, airs 4 p.m. on Sundays, unless
   Lisa and Bart are watching The Cartoon Network.  {ol}

+  Itchy's laugh is wrong.  {mss}

*  Since when does Homer say "Damn it!" instead of "D'oh!"?  [Variety is the
   spice of life.  Also, {nd} notes that the cursing would capture the
   churchgoers' attention more quickly than just "D'oh!" -- Ed.]  {djp}

+  In church was Kent Brockman, real name Kenny Brockelstein, who has been
   seen wearing a c'hai (Hebrew for life).  Granted, someone could have given
   him the c'hai, and Brockelstein could just be a German name, but it's more
   likely that this is just sloppy work.  {bw}

-  Helen's hair has always been gray, yet in the opening (when it's shown),
   it's orange.  {ddg}

+  Lovejoy said that they give you 5 Q's and only 2 U's church's signs.  This
   is incorrect, for in episode [8F12] Lisa The Greek the sign said that
   "EVERY SUNDAY IS SUPER SUNDAY," therefore using 3 U's.  {gl}

*  Why is Lisa, the environmentalist, so willing to go the dump?  {nd}

+  Rev. Lovejoy can't have just two "U"'s for his marquee; he needed three for
   the message "Every Sunday is Super Sunday" during [8F12].  {dj}

=  Marge's speech at the beginning of Act 2 is out of sync.  (It appears to
   match what she said, so it doesn't seem to be a rewrite.)  {ddg}

=  The 1970s scene of Reverend Lovejoy with his trains is jerky, as if the
   train was alternating between high and low speeds.  {ddg}

+  If Lenny doesn't have a wife, whose legs was he shaving in "Marge on the
   Lam?"

+  Carl (along with Homer, Moe, and Barney) was at Lenny's house in "Secrets
   of a Successful Marriage."  (Of course, Lenny might have told his guests
   that his wife was out for the night.)  {nd}

=  While dialing the phone, it seemed as if Homer pressed two different
   buttons that produced the same tone, and pressed the same button that
   produced different tones.  {rs}

*  A long-distance call to Japan would begin with 011811.  {ss}

*  Homer makes his call at 4:10, but the library is only open from 8 a.m. to
   12 p.m.  [{ddg} thinks this "12" is "12 midnight" rather than "12 noon,"
   though -- Ed.]  {bjr}

*  Cutting the cord to a phone's receiver shouldn't disconnect it.  {ddg}

=  At first, all of the bullies circle Ned clockwise, but then Dolph suddenly
   goes counterclockwise.  {ddg}

-  The clock at the Leftorium has no hands.  {jh}

*  It's evidently a school day (when they tire of chasing Ned, the bullies
   say, "Let's go to school").  Yet, Marge yanks Bart and Lisa out of class to
   look for Ned.  {bv}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Donick Cary's writing debut results in one of the best
   episodes of the season, and the finest Marge-centric episode since "A
   Streetcar Named Marge" [8F18].  The realistic plot, coupled with a more
   surreal subplot, works excellently.  There was no lack of laughs either:
   the "Itchy & Scratchy" bit and the Japanese commercial were two of the
   funniest sequences seen on the series this season.  (A)

Joseph J. Barder:  A mixed episode.  The main story had its good moments (the
   saints berating Lovejoy, for example) but the only really funny part of it
   came at ending with the killer apes.  The thing that really set this story
   apart was the bizarre Homer subplot.  It's a shame that they couldn't think
   of a decent way to end it, so it just tapered off.  (B-)

Rich Bunnell:  Oh, man, this episode was HILARIOUS!  I laughed at both the
   Skinner moments ("I'm not principal of the line, mother!"  "And you never
   will be!") and, like so many people on the newsgroup, I laughed my head off
   during the Mr. Sparkle commercial!  "You will join me or die!"  Yeah, the
   Marge subplot was kinda boring, but it picked up once Flanders got into it.
   (A+)

Jason Hancock:  Another decent outing; the plot was a little slow at times,
   but the subplot was pretty good even though it ended too soon.  The
   Japanese video and Homer's interrupting the boring church session were the
   highlights in this episode.  And Marge wasn't as bad as she has been in
   recent episodes (3F11 and 3F24 come to mind).  (B)

Joe Klemm:  I loved the whole Japanese subplot, especially the ad itself. As
   for the main plot, it had some clever moments.  Hopefully, Ned and Lovejoy
   will not suffer in their second trip to Baboon County USA unlike the first
   trip.  (A-)

Ricardo Lafaurie:  This was a nice episode that went toward character
   development of secondary characters, which I usually like, and accentuated
   by -- guess -- MR. SPARKLE!  Un no yoi besto washuuuu!!!!  (A-)

Ondre Lombard:  The story moves along in a very disjointed manner, with no
   direction, and it falls flat by act three.  So, in review, it begins with
   Lovejoy showing apathy to parishioners, and ends with him saving Ned from
   carnivorous baboons, which seemed added because Donick Cary didn't know how
   to complete this doomed tale. As for the Homer plot, it was fortunately the
   only remotely delightful part of this story, even though it in no way tied
   in with the Marge-"plot."  Seems like it belonged elsewhere.  The Mr.
   Sparkle ad, however, was classic.  (C+)

Nick Orechwa:  This episode did have its funny moments, including the Itchy
   and Scratchy cartoon at the beginning and topped of with the Japanese video
   that is sent to Homer.  However, the whole Homer subplot, which did have
   potential, fell flat and was almost brushed aside at the end.  The scene
   with Flanders at the end was more corny than funny.  However, it was good
   that a character like Rev. Lovejoy got the spotlight for a show.  (B-)

Chris Pallotta:  Yuck!  What a stretch for a story-line (Both "Mr. Sparkle"
   AND "In Marge We Trust").  This episode was as flat as a five-year-old can
   of Coors Light.  Could the ending be any less believable?  Sheesh!  At
   least we know Ned still runs the Leftorium and Rev. Lovejoy's first name is
   "Tim".  After "Canine Mutiny", I guess the writers were bound for a DUD!
   During Act 3 I was not ROTFL, as hoped.  Instead I was RFRC (Reaching For
   the Remote Control).  (D)

Abhi Ray:  I really liked this episode. It waas probably the best Marge
   episode since her subplot in "$pringfield". The plot was solid. The premise
   at first seemed weak until Flanders entered the scene. The jokes just
   seemed to come constantly. The episode ran very fluently as one of the best
   this season.  (A+)

Mark A. Richey:  Unlike most people on this newsgroup, I liked most of the
   Marge plot.  However, it got ridiculous about the time they discovered Ned
   in the baboon cage.  The "Mr. Sparkle" ad was very funny ("Join me or
   die!"), but the rest of the subplot fell flat.  I should give this episode
   a lower grade, but I still liked it.  (B)

Lee Salem:  Significant inclusion and seamless integration of many different
   characters and storylines, with the brilliant, bizarre and surrealistic
   "Mr. Sparkle" promotional video being the unquestioned highlight.  I
   laughed more during that segment that at all the SIMPSONS episodes this
   season combined!  (A+)

Yours Truly:  The main plot of this show isn't bad, but it's overshadowed by a
   funnier subplot.  The endings of both plots could stand a little reworking,
   though.  On the plus side we do get a hilarious Funny Video (TM), and some
   very good background on Reverend Lovejoy.  About average as "Simpsons"
   episodes go.  (B)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B+ (3.28)   Std Dev.: 0.8061   (19 reviews computed)

>> Now _that's_ timing

Dale G. Abersold:  An episode about Marge volunteering at the local church
   coincided with an important summit on volunteering in America, featuring
   such respected American figures as Colin Powell and Jimmy ("history's
   greatest monster") Carter.


>> Multiple Voices ...

 - Dale G. Abersold provides bios for tonight's guest voices

Sab Shimono previously appeared in "One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish"
   [7F11] as the apprentice sushi chef.  His previous credits include "Gung
   Ho" (both the film and short-lived television series), and the new release
   "Paradise Road."

   Gedde Watanabe also appeared in both film and television versions of "Gung
   Ho".  He is also remembered for his role as the exchange student in
   "Sixteen Candles."

   Karen Maruyama has had small character roles in many films, most notably
   "Pulp Fiction" and "The American President."

   Denice Kumagai has also had character roles in several films including
   "Clear and Present Danger" and the seminal Vietnam film "Go Tell the
   Spartans."  She is best-known, however, for playing Quon-Le (Mac's wife) on
   "Night Court."


>> Meta-reference corner

Benjamin Robinson:  Marge says, "Nobody is watching us right now," and the
   family looks around self-consciously.  Of course, <we> are watching them
   right now.  (I didn't get this until the second viewing.  Kudos to the
   staff for having a not-immediately-obvious reference.)


>> Le Boom

Benjamin Robinson explains:  Tonight's "Itchy & Scratchy" drew inspiration
   from recent nuclear bomb testing conducted by the French in or near
   Polynesia.  After years of complying with a "gentleman's agreement" not to
   test (I say that because I don't know if France signed the Nuclear Test Ban
   Treaty), France abruptly reserved its decision and announced it would have
   a test explosion of a nuclear device.  The decision met with sharp
   criticism by other governments and environmental groups such as Greenpeace,
   which was very effective if the effect was to have France explode the bomb
   right on schedule.  To date [1997], there are no future tests planned, but
   I don't believe the French ever came right out and said that there would be
   no further testing.


>> In Rev. Lovejoy's tape collection ...

Dallas J. Pesola:  The Doobie Brothers' second single from 1972-73.  Cracked
   the top 40 at #35.  Used in Rev. Lovejoy's flashback scene.  The version we
   heard didn't sound like the original recording by the Doobies.  It may have
   been someone doing a cover.


>> The world's most economical sports car ...

Benjamin Robinson:  ... it's just not the most powerful.  At least, that's how
   Volkswagen pitched its Karmann-Ghia.  The popular little car was built
   around a Beetle chassis and drive train, and was offered as a coupe as well
   as the featured convertible.  If Reverend Lovejoy bought his new in the
   mid-Seventies, he got one of the last ones.  VW discontinued the line after
   the 1974 model year because it would cost too much to meet the new safety
   and pollution control regulations.  Notice that when Lovejoy and the gang
   go looking for Ned, they all pile into the Karmann-Ghia.  A real-life K-G
   owner would laugh at this; it's barely a two-passenger car, let alone five.
   The "rear seat," for example, is little more than an upholstered package
   shelf, and anyone bigger than Maggie would have a tough time fitting.
   Perhaps Marge can be persuaded to bring her station wagon for future
   searches.


>> What was on that box, anyway?

Chris Browne has this answer:  My reception had severe ghosting, but being a
   student of Japanese, I was pleased to be able to read Sparkle's quote on
   the Box.  As far as I could tell it was "Hawai kuriin" or Hawaii Clean,
   though I *may* have miss-read the characters for the first word, with the
   double images and all (what does Hawaii have to do with it anyways?).  If
   anyone knows for sure, please post :)

   I wish I had taped it, just to put the commercial away with the rest of my
   collection of Japanese commercials :)


Justin Lee Massengale has suggests another possibility:  I had a little
   trouble with the speech balloon on the box:  Seemed to me like it said
   "HAWAA  KURIIN !"  I wonder of the first word was intended to say "PAWAA" (
   = "Power clean!").  Another poster read "Hawaii", which doesn't really make
   sense either, but come to think of it now I don't remember exactly what the
   last letter of that word was.


>> Conversational Japanese

Justin Lee Massengale writes...:  But I'm surprised that Homer knew the word
   "Konnichiwa!"  (= hello)


... and Bill Thacker responds:  Remington Micro-screen shavers.  Remember
   Victor Kiam, the guy who made famous the line, "I liked the shaver so much,
   I bought the company" ?  Years ago he did commercials here in the US,
   boasting that he was selling his shavers in Japan and showing clips of him
   doing commercials, in Japanese.  The Japanese ads started with
   "Konnichiwa!"

   Well, if *I* remember that, Homer *has* to remember it.  :-)  Either that
   or he picked it up at the sushi restaurant.


Allyson Taylor also has an intriguing theory:  Remember the episode where
   Homer was the voice of Poochie?  Homer was asked if he ever listened to how
   funny his voice sounded on tape, to which he replied "No, I prefer to
   listen to Cheap Trick".  At the end of Cheap Trick's 'Heaven Tonight' CD,
   about a minute after the last song ends, there's a little musical ending
   (sounds like it was recorded live - or at least the crowd sounds were added
   in for that effect).  This end piece, which only lasts about 30 or 40
   seconds has no lyrics, except the melodic shouting of, you guessed it,
   "Konnichiwa".  Thus, it shouldn't be a surprise that Homer would know...


>> That rake, er, phone scene...

Many people thought the scene where Homer calls the Mr. Sparkle factory was
   overlong.  Justin Massengale has a theorizes why this happened:  as someone
   else noted, it [the phone scene] was severely drawn out. About half way
   through, I found myself saying, "Alright, this had better be REAALLLy
   funny."  Later on in the show I noticed Marge had a line which seemed
   particularly badly lip synched.  Sorry I don't remember exactly where this
   was, but it was part of a longer line which started out with something like
   "Oh, don't be silly.  ...  " followed by a longer declarative sentence.
   The first part was quite out of synch but the rest was fine.  Maybe the
   phone scene was extended to fill in for time removed in a last-minute
   dialogue change?


Dan Crow thinks there may have been a point to this scene, after all:  As a
   Brit living in California, this looked to me a lot like a skit on the awful
   business of dialing abroad from the US.  To phone back to Britain, I dial

   1 800 9 19 19 19 011 44

   *then* I dial the UK area code (four digits) *then* the UK phone number
   (another six digits) for a total of 26 digits.  I'd guess that it is
   similar for dialing Japan, or anywhere else outside of the US.


>> Where is Springfield?  (Part #837)

Marc Wasserman does a little sleuthing:  Homer calls Japan during the day in
   Springfield (after all, the library was open) and also during the day in
   Japan (after all, the Mr. Sparkle factory was open, making the detergent,
   and taking calls).

   But that can't happen east of the Mississippi River.  On Central Standard
   Time, when it's 8 AM (the time a library could open) it's 10 PM in Tokyo,
   and when it's 5PM (the time a library would probably close) it's 7 AM the
   next day in Tokyo - Mr. Sparkle's factory wouldn't be open yet.

   The only way to get crossover of times would be if Springfield is either on
   Mountain or Pacific Standard Time - somewhere in the western United States.

   [D. Sikula noted this assumes the factory isn't run around-the-clock --
   Ed.]


>> Conversational Japanese, Part II

Dave Tallman and Kevin R. Gowen II go above and beyond the call of duty,
   translating the Japanese in the commercial for us:  Ok, now for an attempt
   at transcribing the Japanese of the Mister Sparkle commercial.  Note:  I'm
   a novice in Japanese, so this may have a lot of mistakes.  I've also made a
   literal translation that is even worse than the one in the commercial.

   Aka ni taishite burei da!  Yoguri ni yoberu!
   I am disrespectful/rude to dirt!  I can call out/remove dirt/filthiness!
   Subtitle: I'm disrespectful to dirt!

   Honki da yo!
   I am indeed serious!
   Subtitle: Can you see that I am serious?

   Kore!  Minna doke!  Burabura shiteru tokoro ja nai!
   Hey you!  Everyone out of the way!  This is no place for loafing!
   Subtitle: Out of my way, all of you!  This is no place for loafers!

   Ore to issho ni nasu ka, shinu ki ka?  [or possibly "shi no ki ka"]
   Will you accomplish something with me, or will you die?
   Subtitle: Join me or die!  Can you do any less?

   Aa!  Isamashii houmu rogo desu ne?
   Ah!  It's a courageous home logo, isn't it?
   Subtitle: What a brave corporate logo!

   Misutaa Supaakoru no charengi ni ojimasu!
   Let's respond to the challenge of Mr. Sparkle!
   Subtitle: I accept the challenge of Mr. Sparkle!

   Ausuma pauwa!
   Awesome power!

   Natsu yasumi no keikaku wa aru deshou?
   What might you do with yourself for summer vacation?
   Subtitle: What are your plans for summer vacation?

   Misutaa Supaakoru!  Un no yoo besuto washuuuuuu!
   Mister Sparkle!  Luck's best wash!
   Subtitle: For lucky best wash, use Mr. Sparkle.


Hisashi T. Fujinaka adds:  People were questioning whether the Mr. Sparkle
   commercial was really Japanese.  I can say for certain that it was really
   BAD Japanese.  You'd think they could at least find someone who spoke
   Japanese as a native language and not someone who's just learning it.  They
   sounded like the American version of PINK LADY or something.


Brad Bizzolt argues:  Call me crazy, but I thought this was the point.  Each
   language, when loosely translated into English, tends to sound ridiculous
   to our ears.  Japanese tends to have this lofty, mock-philosophical "land
   of wind and ghosts" type of quality to it when sentences are translated
   literally.  I thought this was just a spoof of this fact, and in usual
   "Simpsons" fashion took it overboard for the purpose of humour.  I also
   thought they pulled it off perfectly.

   [I figured that Fujinaka was questioning the pronunciation or accenting of
   the speaking voices in the commercial, much the way our friends in
   Australia objected to the accents in "Bart vs. Austrailia (2F13)."  But Mr.
   Bizzolt is right in pointing out the rough translation was probably
   deliberate -- Ed.]


Meanwhile, on <alt.tv.futurama>, Michael Morbius writes:  The Japanese in the
   *Simpsons* Mr. Sparkle promotional video was also fake Japanese (one or two
   words were real but when shown the tape, my two Japanese friends said it
   was nonsense).


Hmmm.  The plot thickens.  Thomas L. Rochestro answered:  How well do your
   Japanese friends know English?  How well do they know American culture?  I
   wouldn't put it past somebody to watch this and not think it's worth
   translating because it's just silly ranting about washing powder - and then
   saying "it's nonsense."

   My Japanese is rather limited (about 300 words and 400 kanji) so I can't
   speak to the commercial segment (where Mr. Sparkle says that he's
   disrespectful to dirt) but I can speak to the rest of it.

   The Japanese accents were excellent -- I laughed so hard when the people in
   the park saw Homer and said mi-s-ta su-pa-ku-ru!  When Homer called the
   company, the person answered the phone with the correct greeting (moshi
   moshi) and then said "eigo ga hana-[something something]" (or something
   close to it) which is "he speaks English" -- also the way he turned the
   phone over without saying a word to the "gaijin" is, I understand, typical
   Japanese.

   That they would go to those lengths and then only have "one or two words"
   in the other segment does not seem likely to me.


Michael Morbius:  I'm also a Japanese fan; I've been learning it for three
   years.  I sat down with my dictionary and whatever knowledge was in my head
   at the time and tried to translate every single sentence as best I could.

   It does seem like a terrible waste of effort to make up a bunch of nonsense
   Japanese when they have Sakai and Tsumura on-staff *and* Watanabe (English-
   speaking factory worker) and Shimono (video presenter and "My skilled hands
   are busy!" from "One Fish...") as guest voices and could easily write the
   proper Japanese.  But there you have it.


Thomas L. Rochestro:  Especially (sp?) since you said they said it was
   "nonsense."  I'd describe "my washing powder will violenty particulate your
   dishes" as nonsense, even though it's real English.

   I've had people tell me that simple expressions are "untranslatable" simply
   because they didn't know how to translate them.  (I'm thinking of one
   particular German woman who spoke English very well in regards to the
   greeting "Taegchen!")


>> Fishbulb's true inspiration?

Brian Jaudon suggests where the writers may have gotten the idea for the
   subplot:  I remember Conan O'Brien saying in an interview once that Matt
   Groening has a big collection of Simpsons merchandise from other countries.
   He said that some of the things kind of look like mutated versions of the
   characters, weird Bart Simpson dolls from Brazil and things like that.


>> Conversational Japanese, Part III

The Mr. Sparkle video brought up some memories for Vince Radford:  Thanks to
   anime I'm fluent at "Americanese".  Americanese is nothing more than a
   bunch of gibberish with distinct Japanese sounding overtones.  In high
   school I had everyone convinced that I knew true Japanese until a friend of
   mine who is Japanese-American invited me to his house for dinner where he
   promptly introduced his grandmother (who just "happened" to be visiting
   that day and hardly knew any English) and encouraged me to "get to know"
   her.  Well I won't get into detail, but my little charade was painfully
   exposed ... seeing that Mr. Sparkle bit brought back some funny memories.

>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  E. PLURIBUS MARGE


Ben Weiner notes:  I'm guessing that Haynes Lee is not a Latin enthusiast as
   his alterna-title for this show is  E. PLURIBUS MARGE, which translates to
   Out of[.] many, Marge.  The period is unnecessary (e is a word in Latin,
   not an abbreviation).  In Marge we trust in Latin would be something like
   fîdimus Marge.  [In Mr. Lee's defense, "E Pluribus Unum" is a U. S.
   monetary slogan, along with "In God We Trust."  Using "Fidimus Marge" may
   be grammatically more accurate, but then you lose the parallel.  Besides,
   it's just the alterna-title -- Ed.]


Don Del Grande provides the next two items:  More proof this isn't a Roman
   Catholic Church: the RC version of the Ten Commandments say that the only
   two things "thou shalt not covet" are "thy NEIGHBOR'S wife" and "thy
   neighbor's goods" - nothing about coveting your OWN wife.

   "The Lord only asks for an hour a week!"  "Well, in that case, he should
   have made the week an hour longer!"  Does this mean Homer is willing to go
   to church the day Daylight Savings Time ends?


Joe Klemm gives us these next two items:  The Man Without a Face is a 1993
   film that marked the directorial debut of Mel Gibson.  In it, he stars as a
   disfigured man who helps a boy in learning for a military like school he is
   going to.

   Game Boy is a portable video game system by Nintendo.  The system comes in
   two sizes and six different colors.  The games played on the system can be
   played in black and white or, if you have a special device for the Super
   Nintendo, in color.


Jason Hancock:  The song playing in Lovejoy's car during the seventies is
   "Jesus is Just All Right" by the Doobie Brothers.

Marge:    Homer!  Will you get that crazy box of off the dinner table?
          It came from the dump.
Homer:    But Marge, I'm obsessed with it.  Where did it come from?
          What is it a box of?  How'd my face get on it?
Bart:     Hey, if they got a picture of you, that means they can *see*
          you.  They're probably watching us right now.
Marge:    That's ridiculous.  Nobody is watching us right now.

% Homer's search for the truth takes him to The Happy Sumo restaurant.

Akira:    [on phone] Hai ... Hai ... Hai ... Bye.
          [hangs up and turns to Homer, Bart, Lisa]
          Hi.
Homer:    Akira, can you read this for me?  [hands Akira the box]
Akira:    [reading] Ah, yes.  This is a product called, "Mr. Sparkle."
          Very popular dish detergent.  Hey, [points to box
          illustration] he looks like you.  Ah!  Ah - ha!  Ah!  Ah!
Lisa:     What's he saying?
Akira:    He identifies himself as a magnet for foodstuffs.  He boasts
          that he will banish dirt to the land of wind and ghosts.
Lisa:     Wow.
Akira:    Yes, you have very lucky dishes, Mr. Simpson.  This soap is
          from the sacred forests of Hokkaido, renowned for its
          countless soap factories.
Homer:    [thoughtfully] Hokkaido, eh?

% At the First Church of Springfield, the Listen Lady is in.

Lenny:    See, all along I've been telling Carl I'm married to a beauty
          queen.  Now, he's coming over for dinner.
Marge:    Oh, Lenny, I'm sure he'll like your wife no matter what she
          looks like.
Lenny:    No, no, no, no, no, it's worse than that.  I don't even have
          a wife.  I just said I did to, you know, be a big shot.
Marge:    Oh.  Well, it's time to start telling the truth.  Now, when I
          have to tell my husband the truth, I cook him a big,
          delicious dinner.  By the time he's done eating, he's too
          full and tired to care what I have to say.
Lenny:    Wow, that's great!  When Carl comes over, I'll stuff him
          'till he don't know what's what.
          [Lenny leaves the office.  The camera tracks him to the hall,
          where we see that quite a line of advice-seekers has formed]
Agnes:    Seymour, I'm getting tired.  Tell them we're going next.
Skinner:  Well, I'm not principal of the line, mother.
Agnes:    [accusingly]  And you never will be.

% Homer chases his lead to the old Springfield library.  He asks the

% As the Listen Lady, Marge's popularity in church soon outstrips the
% Reverend's.  Soon, the Reverend can't even finish a sermon without
% being interrupted by people praising her name.  After services, the
% parishioners file past Lovejoy and crowd around Marge, seeking her
% advice.  For her part, Marge is now confident enough to treat Lovejoy
% as her secretary ("Tim, hold my calls").  Dejected, Lovejoy walks back
% into the church.

Lovejoy:        Hmmm.  I'm a shepherd without a flock.  [looks
                heavenward]  What have I done to lose them?
St. Eleutherius:[comes to life in a stained glass window, surrounded
                by a bright light]
                The real question is:  What have you done to keep

Lovejoy:        [gasps] St. Eleutherius of Nicomedia!
St. Eleutherius:That's my name, don't wear it out.
St. Bartholomew:To inspire men, you must be brave.  I introduced
                Christianity to Mongolia.  It didn't take, but it was
                worth a try.
St. Lucian:     Tell us, good Reverend, what great deeds have you done
                to inspire the hearts of men?
Lovejoy:        Well, I had the vestibule recarpeted.
St. Donickus:   I've appeared in over eight thousand visions, and
                that's the lamest reply I've ever heard.
Lovejoy:        Oh, now please, I, I thought saints were supposed to
                be friendly.
St. Donickus:   You ... you're just lucky God isn't here.

% up her despondent husband.  Probably just needs a day or two to
% himself, advises Marge, who is confident that the Reverend will bounce
% back.  Mrs. Lovejoy doesn't seem convinced, but thanks Marge all the

%          *** The Mr. Sparkle video sequence begins here ***
%
% Homer and Bart watch TV.  Lisa runs into the room, waving a package.

Lisa:     Look, we got a package from the Mr. Sparkle company in Japan.
Homer:    Ooh!  [opens package, but only Styrofoam packing peanuts
          spill out.  He holds the package up to his eye.  A videotape
          tumbles out and bonks Homer in the face] Ow!
Lisa:     It's a videotape.
Homer:    Put it in!  Put it in!

          [Lisa does so.  The video opens with a shot of a heavyset man
          lounging in a sunken bathtub, the kind often seen in Japan.
          He puts down the cigar long enough to address the camera]

Man:      [heavily accented]  Oh, hello, American investor.  I see you
          are interested in distributing Mr. Sparkle in you home
          prefecture.  You have chosen wisely.  But please -- don't
          believe me.  Observe this commercial.

          [begin commercial.  A Japanese housewife wearing semi-
          futuristic (in the "Jetsons" mode) clothing loads a
          dishwasher.  She pulls out a whistle, which summons Mr.
          Sparkle.  His head jumps off the Mr. Sparkle box, and floats
          in mid-air.  True to his name, bright sparkles fill the air]

Mr. Sparkle: [in Japanese; subtitled]
             I'm disrespectful to dirt.  Can you see that I am serious?

          [having no arms or legs, Mr. Sparkle scrubs the dishes clean
          by rubbing up and down with his head.  The housewife is
          delighted with her clean dinnerware.  Mr. Sparkle flies into
          the next room, where a baby is playing with a toy xylophone.
          He amuses the child by bouncing on a few keys, and then flies
          off.  In the next scene, he appears deep beneath the ocean,
          where a trio of dancing women hang out (where else?) on the
          sea floor.]

Mr. Sparkle: Out of my way, all of you.  This is no place for loafers!
             Join me or die!  Can you do any less?
Women:       What a brave corporate logo!  I accept the challenge of
             Mr. Sparkle.
Woman #1:    Awesome power!

          [an inset box appears in the upper left corner of the screen,
          showing a windup monkey toy banging a drum.  Mr. Sparkle
          demonstrates his awesome power by blowing up a strong wind of
          heart-shaped symbols.  The wind transforms the dancing women
          into Sumo wrestlers.  (I am not convinced this is an
          improvement.)

          Mr. Sparkle flies over a cow pasture.  A reporter is

          second, then fall to the ground and blink.

          point at the center of the screen.  Mr. Sparkle appears at
          the center and heads toward the camera, rotating in the
          opposite direction.]

Announcer: For lucky best wash, use Mr. Sparkle.

          [Mr. Sparkle blinks.

          Homer, Bart, and Lisa don't quite know what to make of this]

Bart:     Bor-ring!
Homer:    That didn't explain anything.  All I know is that they stole
          my face and used it for their stupid logo.  There's no other
          explanation.
Lisa:     Wait, look!

          [cut to the TV screen again]

Announcer: [in English]
           Mr. Sparkle.  A joint venture of Matsumura Fishworks [a

Bart:      Yep.  There's your answer, fishbulb.
Homer:     Well, it was a good ride while it lasted.  Come on kids,

Bart:      We are home.
Homer:     That was fast.

% You may return to the capsule now.
%
% At church, Marge consoles Cap'n McAllister on the loss of his
% GameBoy.  Just as soon as he leaves, Ned Flanders calls.  Jimbo,
% Dolph, and Kearney have been hanging around the Leftorium, and Ned is
% afraid "they could start slacking at any moment."  Marge suggests Ned
% tell the boys to go away.  Ned does so, but the advice backfires.
% Instead of leaving (as they were about to do on their own), they stare
% menacingly at Ned.
%
% Ned calls Marge back and tells her that things have gotten worse.
% They indeed have -- now the boys have chaired Ned, circling him on
% their mini-bikes like wolves circling a wounded deer.  Marge tells Ned
% to "lay down the law," but Ned isn't up to the task.  When he tries to
% get one of the boys to talk to Marge, they cut the phone line with a
% pair of scissors.  Marge, thinking Ned has hung up and unaware of his
% situation, sits and waits for the next call.  The water cooler burbles
% peacefully.
%
% The next morning, Mrs. Flanders visits Marge.  Maude asks if Homer
% came home last night.  Somewhat surprisingly, he did -- but the real
% shocker is that Ned didn't.  Jimbo's gang pursued him all night, and
% the chase is still on as we speak.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time:  17:05]
%
% This time, it's the Listen Lady who needs some help.

Lovejoy:  [walks into the room]  Yes, Marge?
Marge:    Reverend, I gave Ned Flanders some bad advice.  Now he could
          be in real trouble.
Lovejoy:  [exasperated] What happened now?  Did he swallow a paper
          clip?
Marge:    No, he's disappeared.  Oh, I'm in way over my head.  I mean,
          where do the helpers turn when they need help?
          [Lovejoy looks out the basement window.  As if on cue, a
          bright light streams through the glass and an organ can be
          heard.  The camera pulls back to reveal that Marge has
          accidentally backed into the keyboard]
Marge:    Eh?  [stands up]  Sorry.
-- "In Marge We Trust"

% Confident again, Lovejoy answers the phone when it rings.  It's Ned,
% calling from the gas station where the gang stopped to refuel their
% mini-bikes.  Marge asks where he is, but Ned can only read the price
% from the gas station sign -- $1.49 and eight-tenths.  This is the clue
% Marge and Lovejoy needed:  Ned is at Donny's Discount Gas.
%
% Lovejoy, Marge, Homer and the kids form a posse to find Flanders.
% Crowding into Lovejoy's tiny car, they ride out to Donny's.

Marge:    Donny?
Donny:    What?
Marge:    Did you see a man being chased by some young hooligans?
Donny:    I see lots of stuff.

% At the zoo, Jimbo and the boys break off their pursuit.

-- Spoke too soon, Ned, "In Marge We Trust"

% Reverend Lovejoy and the Simpsons search the zoo, calling out to Ned.
% A Japanese tourist couple sees Homer and immediately recognizes him as
% Mr. Sparkle.  Homer takes time out to greet them in their own language
% ("Konnichiwa").
%
% Suddenly, Ned screams again.  The family quickly pinpoints the sound
% as coming from Baboon County, which is the zoo's name for the baboon
% pit.  They rush up to the rail and, sure enough, there's Ned,
% surrounded by a troop of angry baboons.

Flanders:  Help, what do I do?
Lisa:      Play dead!
Homer:     No!  Run around in circles!
Bart:      No, act like a lion!
Marge:     Swipe at the dominant male!  Come on, Ned, knock that monkey
           down!
-- Sure could use the Listen Lady at a time like this, "In Marge We

% The zookeeper comes by, and is astonished to find that there's a man
% in the baboon area.

Marge:     You've got to get him out of there.
Zookeeper: Jeez, I'd like to, but if they don't kill the intruder,
           it's really bad for their society.
Bart:      They're going to kill him?
Zookeeper: Eventually.  First, they'll eat his skin.

Homer:     Ew.
-- Stuff they don't show on "National Geographic" specials, "In Marge

% Flanders is trapped in a tire swing set up for the baboons.  One of
% the animals tries to sever the rope with a rock.  Flanders yells out
% his last requests -- a fancy funeral with a big coffin and lots of
% jewels.  As the baboons close in, a train whistle sounds.  Reverend
% Lovejoy has commandeered a kiddie train that runs along a mountain in
% the baboon pit.  He reaches down and grabs Ned just as the tire drops
% into the crowd below, and hauls him into the train.  But they're not
% out of the woods yet.  Two baboons jump onto the train.

-- Reverend Lovejoy, "In Marge We Trust"

% Lovejoy grabs a tree branch and swings around like a gymnast, using
% his momentum to kick the two baboons back into their yard.  A third

% Flanders ride to safety while remainder of the train stays with the
% baboons.

Bart:     Wow.
Lisa:     Oh, those poor monkeys.
Marge:    They started it.
-- Putting the blame where it belongs, "In Marge We Trust"

% Ned expresses his gratitude for Lovejoy's bold rescue.

Flanders:  You saved me, Reverend.  You really went above and beyond.
           Thank you.
Lovejoy:   Oh, don't thank me, thank Marge Simpson.  She taught me that
           there's more to being a minister than not caring about
           people.
Flanders:  [chuckles] Amen.
-- Yeah, there's also beating up monkeys, "In Marge We Trust"

% As the two men talk, the train heads back to Baboon County.  The
% cries of the baboons suggests they know who's coming ...
%
% ... but it looks like Lovejoy will live to fight another day.  For
% now, he has the Sunday church crowd enthralled with retelling of the
% rescue of Ned Flanders.

Lovejoy:  Baboons to the left of me.  Baboons to the right.  The
          speeding locomotive tore through a sea of inhuman fangs.  A
          pair of the great apes rose up at me but -- bam, bam! -- I
          sent them flying like two hairy footballs.  A third came
          screaming at me ... [imitates hissing baboon]
          [quietly resolved] ... and that's when I got mad.
Homer:    Now, that's religion.
