               out.

==============================================================================
> Did you notice...
==============================================================================
   ... at the beginning of the scene where Marge wants a nanny, Maggie
       runs by wearing only a blue shirt (and no diaper)?
   ... the real-life celebrities with pictures on the "Before They Were
       Famous" set appeared on the Simpsons before?
   ... the Ford/Bush house is across the street (presumably because
       Ford was in this episode)?
   ... Maggie Roswell gets a starring credit (joining Pamela Hayden and
       Tress MacNeille in this elite group)?

Dale G. Abersold:
   ... this is the first episode written by Jean & Reiss (not counting
       their "story" credit in "'Round Springfield" [2F31]) since the
       "Clown Without Pity" segment of Treehouse of Horror III?
   ... this is the first episode ever premiered on a Friday (in the
       U.S., at least?)

Vince Chan:
   ... the hole in chief Wiggum's sock?
   ... Marge gets through the doorway with an umbrella in her hair?

Timothy Goddard:
   ... people have cans and bottles at the Krusty Komedy Klassic?
   ... the Simpsons have a purple lampshade?
   ... Marge has a heck of a lot of curlers?
   ... Homer gets turned on by watching women's volleyball?
   ... Dr. Hibbert uses a tongue depressor to examine Marge's hair?
   ... Lisa helps to clean up Bart's room?
   ... the three kids are all sleeping in Lisa's bed?
   ... Barney hangs out at the Simpsons' house?

Don Del Grande:
   ... the towers of SNPP are emitting soot rather than steam, like
       nuclear plant towers are supposed to do?
   ... not only do they eat in front of the TV (something they rarely
       do), they do it twice?
   ... Rainier Wolfcastle's commercial is for "Fritz
       Schnackenbfefferhausen"?
   ... after Kearney leaves, Marge's hair no longer has holes?
   ... Bart and Lisa's boom box has buttons labelled "Cue" and "Rev"
       (Review) rather than "FF" and "Rew", and the AM Dial goes up to
       1700?
   ... two things happen in this episode that haven't happened in a
       while - Bart says "Eat My Shorts" and Homer chokes Bart?
   ... when Homer chokes Bart, Bart chokes Homer back?
   ... the chair in the living room has no legs?

       same time (either 12:05 or 1:00)?

       standing there at the end?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... this is the first time since November, 1992 that two new episodes
       have aired in the same week?
   ... the words "KKK" are white?
   ... when 3G03 was produced, The Simpsons was on up against Mad About
       You, the show Krusty parodies terribly?
   ... Homer knows what a babushka is?
   ... Homer's two hair strands stand up straight and jitter when he
       sees Marge's fading hair?
   ... Homer has to pay to roleplay the Civil War at Moe's?
   ... Carl's eyes are crossed at Moe's?
   ... Homer shouts at Mrs. Pennyfeather "Give me those" in reference to
       fake breasts?
   ... Homer scares away a sitter/nanny this time instead of Bart?

       Snowball II is?

Dallas Pesola:
   ... how much Marge looks like Lisa when she imagines herself with
       "Homer hair"?

       and snores as he is lifted away by the umbrella?

Benjamin J. Robinson:

=  During the couch scene, the family is shown outside, while during the
   intro, we see Homer running through the garage and into the house.
   {vc}

=  On the couch scene, Marge looks at her wrist, even though she's not
   wearing a watch.  {dk}

*  If it's called "Krusty's Komedy Klassics", how come it's all new
   material?  {ljs}

=  When Grampa grabs the remote, it's upside down on the next shot.
   {dk}

-  Maggie's clothing is a much lighter shade of blue than normal when
   Marge sets her down to get Bart a glass of milk.  {tg2}

=  The tray with the bottle and bowl disappears when Marge gets Bart his
   milk, but reappears when Marge says "excuse me" and leaves the room.
   {tg2}

-  When Marge sees Dr. Hibbert about her hair loss, the bottom hole of
   her hair is lower than where her head would end.

-  There are no hinges on the door in Dr. Hibbert's office.  {dk}

=  When Shary Bobbins arrives, the door is opened a lot wider from the
   inside than one might assume from the previous outside view.  {dk}

=  Snake's hair is blue when he holds up Hans Moleman in the background
   of the scene with Chief Wiggum.  {tg2}

-  When singing with the milk carton, Apu's vest has buttonholes, but no
   buttons.  {dk}

   dogs in episode 3F03 and is himself a vegetarian.  {bb}

=  Marge gets the beach umbrella out of thin air.  {ol}

*  Lisa's bed isn't big enough for her, Bart, and Maggie to sleep in
   (even if it is a good idea for Bart and Lisa to sleep in the same
   bed, which I question).  {ddg}

=  When we begin to see the Barney snow globe, he's on the sidewalk,
   instead of on the street, like the rest of the entire scene.  {dk}

   song about Barney the booze-hound), the windows in Moe's are green;
   in the close-up, the windows have green and orange diamonds.  {gg}

*  Barney sings about wanting brandy and a snifter of wine.  Brandy is
   served in a snifter, not wine.  {dp2}

=  When Shary Bobbins leaves, everybody is wearing their formal outfits,
   yet when she walks back in, Maggie and Marge are wear their normal
   clothes.  {ljs}

*  Ranier Wolfcastle's Austrian commercial should be in German, not
   English, yet it's clearly not dubbed.  {ddg}

+  The cap on Bart's bed as Bart is throwing cupcakes on the wall is
   blue, but Bart's cap is always red.  {ol}

+  It seems Bart's overcome his fear of cupcakes from [9F14].

=  When Bart is whipping cupcakes in his room, cupcakes appear and
   disappear from the wall and the box.

   and the kids were cleaning his room is nowhere to be found later in

   into the front room to console Sherry?  {dp2}

   3F17?  {dk}

+  The Simpsons don't have a tree in front of the house.  {ol}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  What was this episode in aid of?  Taking the entire
   cast of the Simpsons out of character in order to produce a
   half-assed version of Mary Poppins? Apparently Jean and Reiss still
   haven't recovered from "The Critic" (i.e., gratuitous pop-culture
   references).  The episode was partly redeemed by the final three
   minutes, and several isolated gags, but was still subpar.  C-.

Greg Bigoni:  Even though the show is getting weirder, it's nice to see
   that it's no longer getting worse (as the last few eps have proven).
   This definitely seemed to be more in the style of "The Critic," as
   most of the references were gratuitous, but I didn't care... I was
   ROTFLOL at all of them, especially the Tarantino-esque I&S cartoon.
   It had a good role for Barney, some amusing songs, another "HAIR"
   reference, a consistent story, good character work, and a nicely
   cynical ending. What else do you need? However, I'm only giving it a
   B because the "Marge-loses-her-hair" sequence was a bit creepy.

Jennifer M. Blaske:  I was really enjoying the episode at one point, but
   by the end I wasn't crazy about it. I enjoy Mary Poppins and thought
   the song were parodies were fun, particularly Ms. Smith's singing,
   which is always done well. But by Barney and Moe's song, I started
   thinking, "Okay, let's move on to something else..."
      This will sound funny, but frankly I was a little confused about
   Shary Bobbins character: She teaches the family how to "do a
   half-assed job," but then leaves because she finds them too uncouth.
   Huh? And that was the number one thing I disliked: a good Simpsons
   episode will end with the tone that they are fairly decent, not them
   bragging about what a crappy family they are.  (B-)

Vince Chan:  The all time classic Simpsons parody episode! From Mary
   Poppins to Speed this episode has it all! Another great reserved
   episode that proved The Simpsons still had a few tricks under their
   sleeves. I cracked up so many times during this episode! I can't
   remeber the last time I did. Oh wait, I can.  (A+)

Chris Courtois:  Despite the fact that "Simpsoncalifrag..."'s sole
   reason to exist was as a "Critic"-esque spoof of "Mary Poppins", the
   episode still managed to be funny to someone not so familiar with the
   source material. I don't think I've seen "Mary Poppins" since I was
   about 5, but I still found the episode enjoyable. Unfortunately, you
   still have to know it's a parody for the show to work. Not the best
   extended parody episode (that would still be "Cape Feare"), but the
   structure of parodying a single source is much less irritating than
   the Season 6 style of cramming in as many non-sequiter references.
   (B+)

Brett Davinger:  Not only the best episode of the season but one of the
   top ten episodes of all time. This shows The Simpsons and writers in
   the best of their form as they take on Mary Poppins with success.
   With Groundskeeper Willy as Burt and the best original songs ever on
   the series, this is a soon to be classic. And who can forget the
   great parody of Reservior Dogs.  (A+)

Timothy Goddard:  I was disappointed with this episode.  The Mary
   Poppins song spoofs weren't as sharp as they could have been, and the
   entire subplot with Marge's hair loss was idiotic.  Not even the
   "Hair" musical bit made me really laugh.  The show needs Phil Hartman
   back, and soon.  (C-)

Jason Hancock:  This was a rather bumpy episode that had its share of
   moments.  I loved Willie's song, the I&S cartoon, and young McBain's
   commercial rendition, but there were several slow stretches in
   between.  (B-)

Ryan Johnson:  I walked out of the room during Bart and Lisa's musical
   number.  *ugh*  The Simpsons Sing the Blues was bad enough, they
   don't need to rehash it here.  After this sour note it was actually
   pretty good.  After this there were only three little moments that I
   didn't like.  The nanny having a beer with barney, the kids sleeping
   with each other (the "just for a movie reference" explanation doesn't
   work for me) and the nanny getting sucked into the jet.  This kind of
   ending was totally uncalled for and in very, *very* poor taste. Aside
   from this the "half-assed" musical number and the "mad about shoe"
   thing make up for a few blunders.  (B-)

Diego Kontarovsky:  It's a big step up from their latest tripe (as Lisa
   would put it -- see 3F03) and it made me laugh. I was surprised to
   see nobody took up the oportunity for any references to Bart wanting
   to be a chimney sweep or any magic handbag jokes from which Mary
   Poppins pulled out so many things. But, overall, good episode. I
   loved Barney's "Goodbye, Superman!" line.  (A-)

Ondre Lombard:  It's hard to believe this one is in any way canonical,
   and I hate when The Simpsons venture off into plotlines that milk its
   animation medium bone dry.  But there were some good laughs in Act
   One (Krusty, Marge as Homer, the Turkey in the Straw bit), but it was
   a bit too musical.  I was really wanting to shout "Make it Stop!" at
   one point.  I just don't buy Lisa and Marge being apathetic.  They're
   the glue that keeps the family in order, and they're no different
   than the Bundys if everyone doesn't care.  The ending is kind of dark
   and I don't find it funny. Nearly a clanger, but jolly enough to
   avoid it.  (C)

Nate Patrin:  Hmmm. I thought this was going to be one incredibly
   pathetic episode, but I thought wrong. Sure, it wasn't the best, but
   any episode with Itchy and Scratchy doing a take-off of "Resevoir
   Dogs" complete with Quentin Tarantino giving a lecture on media
   violence, Groundskeeper Willy singing "Maniac", a couch scene that
   had me ROTFL, Bart chuckin' cupcakes... The songs were annoying, but
   mostly funny. Yeah, the destination was pretty lame, but I liked the
   stops along the ride.  (C+)

Werner Peeters:  Finally another episode with plenty of songs, like good
   old [8F18] or [9F21]. The makers have apparently put lots of effort
   in the 3G-series of episodes. These songs are pure gems, esp. doing a
   half-assed job, the drunk in the gutter and the end song: it's nice
   to see the good old dysfunctional family again. The scenes about
   Marge losing her hair in the beginning lasted a bit too long, yet
   overall this episode was great. Some of the highlights: all jokes
   involving Grampa (including him hanging in a tree at the end), Bart
   throwing cupcakes at the wall and of course Reservoir Cats!  (A-)

Mark Aaron Richey:  What in the world prompted the writing staff to do
   an entire-episode parody of a 30-year-old musical (granted, one that
   just about everybody has seen)?  Some good song parodies, but the
   concept had worn out it's welcome halfway through Act II.  Still, it
   was nice to see the full opening, and a terrific couch gag, plus the
   hysterical "news" brief halfway though the show about OFF breaking
   "The Flintstones" record (between this and Fox News Channel promoting
   the Blues Brothers at the Super Bowl, is it any wonder that Time
   Warner doesn't want to carry FNC?).  Good work by Maggie Roswell.
   (C)

Benjamin J. Robinson:  A clever take-off of "Mary Poppins," this episode
   boasts some good songs (lyric-wise, at least) and a look at the
   Simpsons' dysfunctional dynamics.  Some lulls, awkward shifts in
   tone, and ho-hum music detract a little from the experience.  Pretty
   good handling of the tricky "musical" form, though.  (B)

Matt Rose:  I was sort of apprehensive about this one because of all the
   musical numbers that were going to happen but I was pleasantly
   surprised and a  big way. I was too busy laughing in between the
   songs to care. I had been complaining all season about the lack of
   good dialogue and one-liners which made the show what it always was
   and they listened once again. The funniest Grandpa Simpson has ever
   been, I think. And the full opening was shown. Once again my faith
   has been restored. They've still got it, and always will.  (A)

Damien Ryall: It's great to see that once in a while the show's writers
   can quit talking about marital stress, the environment, Lisa's
   annoying pompuossness, and 'Bart does whatever', and actually write
   something funny!  The songs were well parodied, as was the character
   herself, and there were very few, if any, plotty parts.  The stroll
   through the park and Abe flying away on the umbrella were great, and
   the scene where Marge pictures herself with Homer's hairdo was
   classic.  Came very close to a sappy and stupid ending (like we saw
   in all the first-second season episodes) but a jet plane quickly took
   all that away. I don't want episodes that make you think, I just want
   to be entertained.  This was a great episode!  (A)

Yours Truly:  As fate put it, I couldn't watch the episode live, and had
   to tape it; during any subsequent viewing, my thumb just ached for
   the "forward" button, which speaks in volume. It's not that I dislike
   music in the Simpsons universe (I rather liked 8F18, 8F19, and half
   of "Sing the Blues"), but I find myself uncomfortable around musical
   numbers, where people start singing out of the blue for no other
   apparent reason than to make sure it's a real musical number. So,
   when facing song after song of "we're bad, we're rad, we're a mess
   and we love it", I grabbed whatever humor was left, silently waiting
   for the real Simpson family to be back next week.  (C-)


AVERAGE GRADE:  B (2.98)

NIELSEN RATING: ?  (Ranked 21th out of 112)  {ol}

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> There's grunt and grunt

One of the most frequent questions from alt.tv.simpsons newcomers is how
   to spell Homer's renowned expression. Although the generally accepted
   spelling is "D'oh!", many sources feature different versions,
   including closed captioning's own "D-oh!"

   But the funniest part is, if you ever looked at a Simpsons script,
   all you would see are mentions of "annoyed grunts" over and over.
   When the series started, Matt and the boys let Dan Castellaneta
   choose an interpretation for the "(Annoyed Grunt)" indicator; since
   then, Homer's "D'oh!" has always been referred to in that fashion.
   (Though we know through 3F24 and 3G01 that the writers acknowledge
   the usual spelling.)

   All of this makes this episode's *official* title:
   "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious". Some TV Guides
   actually printed this version in their listings; Robert Berry also
   notes that it was featured in the DSS onscreen program guide.


>> Old Joke Department

Dale G. Abersold:  Grampa's predicament with the "old-fashioned phone"
   is a reference to a classic joke: Guy goes to a doctor with two
   horribly burnt ears.  The doctor asks him how it happened, so the guy
   says "Well, I was doing the ironing when the phone rang, so I picked
   up the iron instead of the phone, and burnt my ear."  The doctor
   asks, "What happened to the other one, then?" The guy says, "Wouldn't
   you know it, the joker called me right back!"  Rim shot.


>> Homer's source of "mature" entertainment

Jason Hancock:  ESPN is cable TV's premier sports network.  Founded in
   1979 as the world's first 24-hour sports network, it is known for
   showing obscure sports, like women's volleyball, to fill holes in its
   schedule.  But it also airs major sports like NFL and college
   football, major league baseball, college basketball, and NHL hockey
   as well as the popular "SportsCenter" sports newscasts.


>> Those Greeks have words for everything!

Rocci Cirone:  Homer's fetish with women (Marge, in this case, of
   course) who have beach umbrellas stuck in their hair could easily be
   labeled as aberrant sexual behavior. Psychologists call this
   particular fetish "Aigialoheliokuklophilia" - (very) rough Greek for
   the love of "beach sun shields."


>> Before They Were Famous

Ondre Lombard:  "Before They Were Famous" is a clear parody of the
   series about small roles and things celebrities did before they
   became stars, hosted by Scott Baio.  It began as specials on ABC, all
   of which usually did well in the ratings.  ABC decided to make the
   show weekly and put it up against The Single Guy in the winter of
   1995.  In the fall, the show was cancelled. Rainier Wolfcastle in a
   commercial parodying the Oscar Meyer jingle is more funny because
   it's true parody.  A lot of stars are showcased in a commercial for
   Oscar Meyer weiners.


>> Fixing Emmett

Steve Frayne:  Charles Bronson is a famous actor who had made about 38
   movies in his career.  His persona has been long been associated with
   killing people, often as a police officer, and usually by shooting
   them. He's usually on the good side of the law as seen in this
   episode, but he always has a tendency to go way to far.  In "10 to
   Midnight" as a cop, he was overly ambitious about locking up a
   murder.  He had to be restrained from beating the man, and then when
   lack of evidence crept up on Bronson, he planted blood in order to
   convict the killer.  When forced to fess up, he shot the killer
   square in the head.  In "The Stone Killer" he is again an ambitious
   cop who does whatever's necessary to rid the city of organized crime,
   including shoot several people.  He's most famous though for his
   "DeathWish" quintilogy in which he is a vigilante always seeking
   revenge.  He gets very blatant in his killing of criminals as his
   walking out the door flagrantly brandishing his huge hand gun
   suggests. It's understandable that Barney Fife (Don Knotts) would be
   so shocked when the easygoing Andy Griffith was replaced with such a
   cold-hearted brute.


>> A short rant

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Thanks <so> much for talking of the ending
   credits, Fox.  Now, I'll get to hear your promotion for the cinematic
   masterpiece "True Lies" over and over again.  What a tremendous
   improvement over hearing the "Mary Poppins" variation of the closing
   music!  It's decisions like that that makes Fox the fourth-largest
   network in the United States.


>> An ode to detail

Robert Berry:  I love it when the writers and animators pay attention to
   detail; it makes the episodes so much more rich and enjoyable, and
   even more fun to watch repeatedly.

   An example: during the scene where Marge is imagining herself with
   Homer's hair, watch her face instead of the thought balloon.  A full
   second or so before she starts sobbing, her lip starts trembling,
   capturing perfectly the feeling of finally "losing it" that Marge is
   going through at that moment.

   Another: listen to Maggie's footsteps as she's running through the
   house without a diaper.  We hear thump-thump-thump until she crosses
   from the carpeted TV room into the kitchen, and then the
   slap-slap-slap of bare feet on vinyl flooring.  *That's* attention to
   detail!

   And watch Maggie throughout the episode, particularly during the
   final musical number.  She tries *so* hard to go along with all the
   dance moves, but that darned gravity thing keeps interfering.


>> All the lyrics, all the time

Dominik Halas:  Well, here they are: the lyrics to all the songs from
   3G03.  It took me an hour to copy these down, people.  I broke my
   back for you on this one!  My back!  I - ah, no one cares.

   - Minimum Wage Nanny

             Lisa: If you wish to be our sitter,
                   Please be sweet and never bitter.
                   Help us with math and book reports,
             Bart: Might I add - eat my shorts!

                   (spoken)
             Lisa: Bart!
             Bart: Just cuttin' through the treacle.

             Lisa: If Maggie's fussy, don't avoid her,
             Bart: Let me get away with moider!
             Lisa: Teach us songs and magic tricks,
            Homer: Might I add - no fat chicks!

                   (spoken)
            Marge: Homer!

             Lisa: The nanny we want is kindly and sage,
            Homer: And one who will work for minimum wage.
             Lisa: Hurry nanny, things are grim,

                   (spoken)
           Grampa: I'll do it!

      Bart & Lisa: Anyone but him.


   - Cut Every Corner

             Shary: If there's a task that must be done,
                    Don't turn your tail and run,
                    Don't pout, don't sob,
                    Just do a half-assed job!

                    If... you... cut every corner
                    It is really not so bad,
                    Everybody does it,
                    Even mom and dad.
                    If nobody sees it,
                    Then nobody gets mad,
              Bart: It's the American way!

             Shary: The policeman on the beat
                    Needs some time to rest his feet.
            Wiggum: Fighting crime is not my cup of tea!
             Shary: And the clerk who runs the store
                    Can charge a little more
                    For meat!
               Apu: For meat!
             Shary: And milk!
               Apu: And milk!
              Both: From 1984!

             Shary: If... you... cut every corner,
                    You'll have more time for play,
       Shary & OFF: It's the American waaaaay!


   - A Boozehound Named Barney

          Shary: In front of a tavern,
                 Flat on his face,
                 A boozehound named Barney
                 Is pleading his case.

         Barney: Buy me a beer,
                 Two bucks a glass.
                 Come on, help me,
                 I'm freezing my ass.

                 Buy me brandy,
                 A snifter of wine.
                 Who am I kidding?
                 I'll drink turpentine.

            Moe: Move it, ya drunk,
                 Or I'll blast your rear end.
         Barney: I found two bucks!
            Moe: Then come in, my friend!

          Shary: And so, let us leave
                 On this heartwarming scene.
           Bart: Can I be a boozehound?
          Homer: Not till you're fifteen.


   - Happy With Things The Way They Are

              Homer: Around the house, I never lift a finger,
                     As a husband and a father, I'm sub-par.
                     I'd rather drink a beer
                     Than win father of the year,
                     I'm happy with things the way they are.

               Lisa: I'm getting used to never getting noticed,
               Bart: I'm stuck here till I can steal a car.
              Marge: The house is still a mess,
                     And I'm going bald from stress,
       Marge & Kids: But we're happy, just the way we are.

                Ned: They're not perfect,
                     But the Lord says "Love thy neighbour."
              Homer: Shut up, Flanders.
                Ned: Okely-dokely-do.
              Shary: Don't think it's sour grapes,
                     But you're all a bunch of apes,
                     And so I must be leaving you!


>> Loose Ends

Don Del Grande:  There was supposed to be a variation on "Chim-Chim-
   Chiree" with Patty & Selma

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Bart complains that "These specials get worse
   every year."  Well, this is a special episode, on a special night...

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Former President Gerald Ford was a Boy Scout and
   did appear in a commercial promoting the Boy Scouts of America.

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Guy Fawkes tried to blow up the Parliament
   building in the 1600's but failed.  The British still commemorate
   this close call.  The informal word "guy," for a man, actually came
   from this Guy.

Benjamin J. Robinson:  "The Andy Griffith Show" ran in the early sixties
   and featured Andy Griffith as a friendly small-town sheriff.  Charles
   Bronson, known for his tough-cop "Death Wish" movies, might be the
   exact opposite type of police officer.  (Don Knotts played bumbling
   Deputy Fife, who appears in the clip.)

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Quentin Tarantino directed "Reservoir Dogs" and
   "Pulp Fiction." He is almost as reference-mad as the producers of
   "The Simpsons," so mentioning him seems apropos.

Ryan Johnson:  Anyone notice that in the Fox commercial for the next
   episode (4F12), Lisa's line "the Fox network has sunk to a new low"
   had the word "Fox" cut out?  I wonder why =)

       things you'll ever have to do.  Have a dollar.
        [gives a dollar bill to Bart]
 Lisa: But he didn't do anything!
Homer: Didn't he, Lisa?  Didn't he?
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

% But Homer wakes up and takes back the dollar.

 Homer: All right, Marge, I'll get you your nanny.  And to pay for it,

Pennyfeather: Hello, I'm Mrs. Pennyfeather.  I understand you are
              looking for a nanny.
       Marge: Pleased to meet you.
       Homer: Wait a minute, Marge.  I saw "Mrs. Doubtfire."  This is a
              man in drag!  [starts pulling at her hair as if it were a
              wig] You're phony!  Fakey, phony broad!  [runs after her]
              Gimme those!
       Marge: Homer, if you're going to do that to every applicant,
              we're never going to find one.

  Homer: I like him.
Kearney: Thanks.  Hey, where do you keep the liquor?
  Homer: I hide a bottle of schnapps in the baby's crib.
  Marge: I'm sorry, young man.  You're not what we're looking for.
Kearney: [sotto voce] You're tellin' me, you blue-haired witch.
  Marge: I heard that!
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

% Later, in the kitchen.

Marge: I guess we're not going to find anyone.
 Lisa: We have our own suggestions for the new nanny.  Would you like to

Homer: You have my undivided attention.  [Meanwhile, in Homer's brain,

% Marge, on the other hand, would be happy to hear her children's
% suggestions, which take the form of a musical number.  Lisa wants a
% wise and caring nanny, Bart wants her to be rather permissive, and
% Homer wants her to be low-paid and "no fat chicks."  But all agree:

Shary: Hello, I'm Shary Bobbins.

% The family is interviewing Miss Bobbins.  Homer's first questions is
% about bad habits, and Shary Bobbins claims she's practically perfect.
% "So am I" replies Homer, before drinking milk out of the carton and
% scratching his butt.  After a good belch, the interview continues.

 Homer: Question two.  Who was your last employer?
 Shary: Lord and Lady Huffington of Sussex.

 Marge: That's Carl.
 Homer: Oh yeah!  [back to Shary]  So!  You worked for Carl, eh?
-- "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala-D'oh-cious"

 Bart: Pop quiz, hotshot.  I'm supposed to be doing my homework, but you

       you do?
Shary: I make you read every article in that magazine, including Norman

Homer: Ooh.  She is tough.

Marge: Ooh, I can see myself!

% Bart's bedroom is a disaster, and Shary tells the kids that they need
% to clean it up.  They are reluctant to do so, until she starts a
% helpful musical number about doing it the "American Way."
%
% Shary covers a pile of clothes on Bart's bed with the covers.  Bart
% crams toys and things into his drawer.  Lisa stashes balls underneath
% the bed. On the other side of the bed, Bart is stashing a box
% containing toys and a half eaten sandwich under it.  Lisa picks up
% some toys (and Maggie) and drops it all (including Maggie) into the
% toy chest.  Bart empties his wastebasket outside the window.  He puts
% more crumpled up papers in the basket and then empties it outside
% again.  THEN he throws out the wastebakset entirely.
%
% Bart goes over to the closet with a pile of clothes and tosses it in
% the already full closet and he, Lisa and Shary try to close the door.
% Once the song is done, the family marches out Bart's room and shut the
% door, causing everything to fall apart, with the mess being restored.
% (Maggie lifts up the toy chest and looks around)

% Shary goes down the street, strolling Maggie in a baby buggy and a

% with a kiss and he blushes.

% Meanwhile, Willy is entertaining a crowd with his accordion rendition
% of "Maniac" which he closes by pulling a rope that causes a bucket to
% spill water on him.  Everyone walks away giving him no applause.
% "Thank you, you ungrateful bast..." he goes, just before seeing Shary.

 Shary: Hello, Willie.
  Lisa: You know her?
Willie: Aye.  Shary Bobbins and I were engaged to be wed back in the old 
	country.  Then she got her eyesight back.  Suddenly the ugliest

% Back at home, Marge, with fuller hair, surveys the tidy house with
% Homer.

Marge: That Shary Bobbins is a miracle worker.  The kids love her, the
       house is spotless, and my hair's grown back.  It's so full and
       thick it can support a beach umbrella.
