Lisa's Solo:- Unusual, random atonal bursts

Couch      :- The family runs in and sit down, but then they notice the
              living room looks different.  The camera pans slightly
              right, and we see David Letterman sitting at his desk with
              his back to us.  He turns around and smiles.

> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
===============================================================================
In the opening scene, Milhouse faces the parking lot; when the camera
changes angles, he is facing Bart.

When Bart repaints the lines, how does he get rid of the existing lines
without leaving a trace?  {ddg}

The car where Mrs. Krabappel should be has a Krabappel-colored person
that looks very similar to Miss Hoover in one shot.  {rl}

When Mr. Largo is parking, the front part of the passenger side of his
car is drawn over part of the car next to it; there's no way he could
have parked it without a much wider turn radius.  {ddg}

Bart's paintbrush and paint disappear.  {dh}

Miss Hoover's car ends up slightly more purple than it started.  {ddg}

Doesn't it seem so peculiar for all the teachers to arrive at school at
the same time?  {dh}

In order for Bart to set up the "parking space" gag, both Milhouse and
he would have arrive early (and miss the school bus).  {dh}

After the canister drops, the robot-arm disappears.  {dh}

If there's no way out of the room with the door painted on the wall, how
did everybody get in?  {ddg} [Dave Hall says, "Through the normal way --
by a door.  I assume in cases of emergencies, normal doors are probably
locked, to prevent contamination.  (So the gang would look for an
emergency exit.)"]

On Burns' desk, the quill pen changes ink-wells.  {dh}

The notepad only appears when Burns needed it.  {dh}

The notepad Smithers throws turns into book on floor.  {dh}

Charlie's hard hat disappears before he gets sucked up.  {dh}

In one scene, the quill pen turns black.  {dh}

Burns is asked to "hire at least one woman," but in previous episodes,
women employees have been clearly visible at the plant: 1F02, 9F05, 8F04
come to mind.

Should an optometrist have a stethoscope?  {dh}

Did you notice how convenient it was for the optometrist to pull from
his coat pocket, the correct pair of eyeglasses for Bart?  {dh}

If Bart wears big shoes then technically, he should be at least a good
five inches taller than most other kids.  {dh}

Carl & Lenny are to Homer's left, but the viewpoint from Smithers &
Mindy depicts C&L as standing directly in front of Homer.  {dh}

The pipe over Homer, as he runs out of his workstation, appears to enter
his workstation, but stops short of the wall.  {dh}

SNPP's parking lot seems pretty full at the end of Homer's shift.  {dh}

There really isn't much of a point in stealing pens if you're only going
to store them on the back seat of your car.  {dh}

At Moe's Tavern, Barney's and Homer's mugs change places.  {dh}

Mindy's purse only appears when she needed it.  {dh}

Perhaps seeing Homer sliding down a cooling tower is funny, but it's
stupid to place an elevator inside (or around) a cooling tower and to
show Homer & Mindy descending several floors before showing Homer
sliding down from the top of the cooling tower.  {dh}

When Marge greets Homer, the front door should open to the right, not
the left.  {dh}

The TV remote in Homer's hand vanishes.  {dh}

Homer shoves the phone book into the telephone.  {dh}

Slow-mo on Homer, inside the telephone booth, shows him hitting the
ground, face down, but after the bounce Homer's head faces sideways.
{dh}

When Klink shows Spirit Homer how his life would be, we see Homer
playing tennis right-handed.  When Homer says "I, as well", he is still
holding his racket in his right hand.  Then Homer asks Jeeves "are you
happy?" and the "camera" cuts to a different angle, and Homer's racket
has changed hands; he then proceeds to serve left-handed.  {md}

Returning from the dream, Homer's head faces the other direction.  {dh}

In the dark, Bart isn't drawn with his eyeglasses.  {ddg}

Martin's pens are missing from his pocket during the lighting of the
candle.  {dh}

In the "refuge of the damned", the kid writing the binomial equation
uses both a capital "A" and a small "a" for the same variable.  {ddg}

Lisa's position seen in the mirror is incorrect.  {dh}

The hotel is the "Capital City Plaza Hotel" - but isn't the city spelled
"CAPITOL City"?  {ddg} [Dave Hall suggests the misspelling could be to
get around any ordinances or trademarks.]

The door to Homer's hotel suite opens to the left, but opens to the
right when Homer enters the room with Mindy.  {dh}

Homer leaves his suit jacket back at the restaurant.  {dh}

With Homer & Marge laying on the hotel bed, whose hand is that turning
off the lamp?  Could the hand belong to Homer?  (Even with him lying on
his back with Marge on top of him?)  {dh}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Cameron Campbell: A most triumphant episode!  Better than 'Rosebud,' it
    was made excellent by the presence of a clear, coherent theme.  I
    was also happy to see Homer acting like his bumbling, confused old
    self again instead of the mean, vicious Homer that we have seen so
    much of this season.

Brendan Dunn: This one has put to rest the idea that the show is going
    downhill.  It may have hit a dry spell, but they seem to be back on
    track now.

Mike Loux: Definitely one of the (if not *THE*) best episodes of the
    season!  It had all the classic ideosyncrasies (damn your feeble
    brain!) of the "Homer's job" type episodes, including: Burns'
    tightfistedness -- "Someone is charging room service to our
    company!"  The general quality of the workers - "We can't pee in the
    drinking fountain!" among other things.

Joey Berner: Well, "The Last Temptation of Homer" just didn't quite work
    to me.  [...] It was just there.  Average.  So what.  A little dull
    in fact.  Once again they've gone back to the two stories per
    episode, neither seeming to fit with the other.  I really can't
    think of any memorable quotes from this one so I guess my review
    would be a "C".

Don Frega: Last night's episode certainly used all the standard devices
    well, but it was fairly predictable.  The unexpected (such as Burns'
    teddy bear's journey) is what really sets The Simpsons apart from
    other shows; "Last Temptation" simply didn't deliver this.  The
    ghost of Colonel Klink was a fine touch, although that too seemed a
    bit predictable.

Don Del Grande: I give it a B-; they got their act together concerning
    keeping both the main story and the subplot going throughout the
    show, but the story didn't seem to have any "snap" to it, and I for
    one saw that ending coming the second Homer invited Mindy into his
    room.  I was expecting Mindy to mention that she had a husband and
    three kids...

Tom Collins: I thought everyone would love this.  It's got a coherent
    story not based on a parody of anything specific, has a great new
    character, great lines, great situations, funny lines, and takes on
    corporate greed by high-tech firms (Zutroy), the energy industry's
    assault on solar power, HMOs, and lots of other stuph in typical OFF
    fashion.  Now people are calling the show predictable.  Ha!

Marlon Shows: A+.  Funniest episode of the year.  Should win an emmy!

Hugh Brown: Last night's episode, "The Last Temptation of Homer," was
    the funniest episode ever.  I thought everything, thats everything,
    was hysterical.  The writing was just perfect, the voices, tripped-
    out Bart voice, insane underground nerd farm.  I was screaming like
    there was no tomorrow.

Ron Carter: "A" - A solid "A" with no doubts.  Good clean refs that were
    in context; Homer pulls through in the end.  Highlights were Homer
    having the Botticelli hallucination, Barney does "Jeannie".

Carl Frank: Another winner.  Not quite as good as the season's best
    (Rosebud), but a compact and logical story.  Only flaw: Mindy's
    attraction to Homer was never explained and was a tad unbelievable.
    But nothing can top Colonel Klink (Verner Klemperer) as Homer's
    conscience.  [...] Overall rating B/B+.

Keith Lim: The second storyline (or subplot) involving Bart was
    uninspired and didn't seem related to the main story at all.  The
    main plot was implausible, and ended abruptly, leaving loose threads
    (i.e., not a tidy resolution).  [...] This episode I consider to be
    one of the poorer ones of this season.  C+, salvaged only by its
    "moments".

Yours truly: Good episode.  I was laughing very hard for much of it.
    Too many choice moments to recount in a short space.  And lots of
    great references, too!  Michelle Pfeiffer was a fine casting choice.
    [...] I give it a B, not an A because Mindy being attracted to Homer
    was, well, a little far-fetched.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> Bart's cockney accent

Bart talks briefly in a Cockney accent in this episode, just as he did
    in 8F18 ("...pain in me gulliver"), 9F12 ("What a revoltin'
    development"), 9F18 ("Shine yer boots, guv'ner?"), and 9F22 ("...
    best in all Westminster!")  The "gulliver" line is a "Clockwork
    Orange" reference, says Ricardo Lafaurie.  Bart's other lines refer,
    respectively, to "My Fair Lady", "A Christmas Carol", and "Mary
    Poppins".

Michael Neylon disagrees, however.  "I've actually seen CO, and Alex's
    accent is NEVER that obnoxious during the whole movie (Its more of a
    monotone-like thing...it was done well in 9F04).  Nor does Alex ever
    say lines similar to the few in question."  He says that Bart's
    accent reminds him of "the accent that Dick van Dyke uses in `Mary
    Poppins'."

>> Zutroy, as American as apple pie

Tom Collins notes, "60 Minutes recently did a story on Hewlett-Packard
    hiring Eastern Bloc people as programmers, then dramatically
    underpaying them and keeping them as virtual slaves.  Shortly
    afterwards, H-P abandoned the program."

>> Political neutrality department

Elson Trinidad says, "When Kent Brockman discusses profiles of
    unfaithful presidents (Kennedy, Eisenhower, Bush, Clinton), that
    equals two Democrats and two Republicans."

>> "The Other NRA"

Tony Hill says, "This is a reference to the National Rifle Association,
    America's pro-gun lobby which has been known to oppose measures like
    putting `keep out of reach of children' on boxes of bullets.  They
    were a powerful and feared force in Washington until their clout
    suffered a massive stroke in 1993."  This stroke was the Brady Bill,
    a law which requires a seven-day wait between buying a gun and
    receiving it.

>> Homer's gibberish

When Homer tries to read his sweaty palm to Mindy, part of what he
    utters is "nom yo ho renge kyo."  Joshua Love noticed that this is
    "a mantra that Akbar and/or Jeff chanted once in one of the Life in
    Hell comic strips."  Jim Dyer says it's the title of the "Lotus
    Sutra", and Raymond J. Brennan recounts, "I remember meeting some
    [Buddhists] at a grocery store and they invited me over to chant.  I
    remember THAT as being the one chanted most....when chanted in
    repetition several times, while thinking of something you want, it
    will come."

Richard Oliver says that it is a Nichiren-Soshu Japanese chant, "Nam
    Myoho Renge Kyo", and that roughly translated, it means "Devotion to
    the mystical laws of cause and effect which govern all the sounds
    (activities) in the universe."  He goes on, "Part of the effort [of
    `Shakabuku' missionaries] is to persuade prospective converts that
    whatever they chant for they will receive."

Tom Collins correctly points out, "The chant also appears in `Revenge of
    the Nerds II' where the evil fraternity boys have the nerds in their
    underwear and facing crocodiles.  The nerds burst into a group chant
    of `Nam myo-ho renge kyo' in a desperate effort to invoke a
    miracle."

As well, the very last thing Homer says sounds like "Semper ex tyran
    --", which would make it awfully similar to what John Wilkes Booth
    said after shooting Lincoln: "Sic semper tyrannis," which means
    "Thus always with tyrants."

>> Lionel Hutz: "Get out of my office!"

Ricardo Lafaurie writes, "IMHO, this is a reference to the case of Katz
    v.  United States (1967).  In this case, the FBI had bugged a
    telephone booth without a warrant investigating Charles Katz.  As a
    result of the evidence gained, Katz was arrested and convicted in
    California for using telephone lines to transmit betting information
    from L.A. to Miami and Boston.  Katz took his case to the Supreme
    Court, which ruled in Katz' favor, and declared that this is illegal
    under the Fourth Amendment without a warrant.  Thus, Lionel Hutz was
    probably using the telephone lines to do something illegal without
    risk of being wiretapped at his house."

>> Barry Manilow's "Mandy"

Ron Carter supplied me with the words to "Mandy":
    
    Oh Mandy, you came and you gave without taking,
    And I sent you away.
    Oh Mandy, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking,
    And I need you today...

Contrast this to Homer's first version:
    
    Oh Mindy, you came and you gave without flaking,
    But I sent you Ben Gay.
    Oh Andy, you kissed me and stopped me from something,
    And I --

And Homer's second version:
    
    Oh Margie, you came and you found me a turkey,
    On my vacation away from worky.

>> Legionnaire's Disease

Tony Hill writes, "This often fatal malady was discovered at an American
    Legion convention at the Bellvue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in
    1976.  Some wags suggested the disease was caused by wearing blue,
    drinking lots of Scotch, and holding conservative views."

>> Burns and monkeys

Tim Connors lists the following running "Burns and simians" gags:

    - 8F02: Burns and the Monkey's Paw (Guy de Maupassant reference)
    - 9F04: Burns and King Homer
    - 9F15: Burns' roomful of near-Shakespeare-typing chimps
    - 1F01: the robo-Burns/"Planet of the Apes" thing {rl}
    - 1F02: Burns' reference to "the Jade Monkey"
    - 1F02: Planet of the Apes/Robo-Burns
    - 1F07: Flying monkeys

Milhouse: I fear to watch, yet I cannot turn away.

% then burns out.  {The camera pans past all the exhibits at the energy
% convention inside the convention center: cold fusion, "Oil Power",
% "What About Wind?", coal, and water.  It comes to rest on the solar
% energy display ("Cheap, clean hope for tomorrow"), which is being run
% by Hans Moleman.  A man in a suit with sunglasses asks, "So this stuff
% really works?"  "It certainly does," says Hans proudly.  "Oh, well,
% lotsa luck!" says the man, giving Hans a chop in the neck.  A number
% of other men in suits appear, and two of them close red curtains
% around the exhibit.  When they open them again, one man sits behind
% the desk in front of a banner that says, "Fossil Fuel: Use Us and
% Nobody Gets Hurt."}

% Homer and Mindy sit at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant booth.
% Behind them, the booth's display proudly advertises, "As Seen on 60
% Minutes".  Mindy files her nails.

Man 1: Thanks for poisoning the planet, bastard!
Mindy: Get bent!
Man 2: No more Chernobyl!
Homer: Go to hell!
-- Homer and Mindy run the Nuclear Energy display, "The Last Temptation
    of Homer"

% Homer tosses a brick at him (which he had ready, as though he was
% expecting trouble), and chuckles.

Homer: You know, I was a little worried about coming to this convention
       with you.  But I think as long as we're not alone together --
  Man: [over loudspeaker] And now, the moment you've been waiting for.
       This years King and Queen of Energy are Homer Simpson and Mindy
       Simmons!
Homer: Huh?
        [Everyone applauds as the two are given crowns]
  Man: Homer, Mindy, you've just won a romantic dinner alone at Madam
       Chao's, the sexiest Chinese restaurant in Capital City.
Homer: Is there any way to get out of this?
  Man: [stern] No!
-- Accolades fit for a resume', "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Homer and Mindy finish their sexy dinner at Madam Chao's.

Mindy: [sighs] What a perfect evening.  It sure was nice of them to make
       us cheeseburgers.
Homer: Uh, yeah.
-- At a Chinese restaurant, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Homer opens his fortune cookie and reads his fortune.

Homer: [reading his fortune] "You will find happiness with a new love."
       [out loud] Aw, even the Chinese are against me.  [sigh] What's
       the point?  I can't fight fate.
        [In the kitchen...]
Man 1: Hey, we're out of these "New Love" cookies.
Man 2: Well, open up the "Stick With Your Wife" barrel.
-- Controversial fortune cookies, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Back at their hotel...

Homer: [unhappy] Well, I guess you'll want to come in.
Mindy: [bright] OK.
Homer: [mocking] "OK!"
        [They sit on the bed]
Mindy: This was a really nice night, Homer.
Homer: Yeah, yeah.
-- Homer, appreciative date, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% He begins sobbing.

Mindy: What's wrong?
Homer: Oh, yeah, like you don't know.  [weeping] We're gonna have sex!
Mindy: Oh...well, we don't have to.
Homer: [sad] Yes we do!  The cookie told me so.
Mindy: Well...desserts aren't always right.
Homer: But they're so sweet!
-- Homer and Mindy alone in the hotel, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Mindy tries to reassure him.

Mindy: Homer...you don't have to do anything you don't want to.
Homer: Well, maybe I want to...but then I think about Marge and the
       kids...well, not the boy: he drives me nuts.  Sometimes I'd just
       like to --
-- Wandering train of thought, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% Mindy says that Homer knows how she feels, and she tells him it's up
% to him.  "Look in your heart; I think you'll see what you want."
% Their heads move slowly closer as though they're about to kiss
% passionately, but instead they kiss briefly.  Homer makes up his mind
% and soon he is drooling over shapely, female flesh as Barry Whites
% "Can't Get Enough of Your Love" plays in the background.

Homer: Oh, baby.
Marge: This was a _wonderful_ idea, Homey.  [kisses him] Hey, there's a
       turkey behind the bed!
Homer: Mmm, Marge.
Marge: [laughs girlishly, turns out the light]
Homer: [sings]
       Oh Margie, you came and you found me a turkey
       On my vacation away from worky...
-- Homer, incurable romantic, "The Last Temptation of Homer"

% In the dark, another pair of eyes appear.  The owner of the eyes wolf-
% whistles, makes a cat noise, imitates a bed squeaking, purrs, pants,
% barks, howls, twiddles his lips, and says, "Hubba, hubba!"  Homer
% punches him in one eye.
