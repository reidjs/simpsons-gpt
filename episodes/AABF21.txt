Blackboard:     I AM NOT THE LAST DON

Couch:          The family runs into the living room for another fine evening
                of television.  Marge notices that someone has written "Matt
                Groening" on the rug, and uses a cloth to rub out the
                signature.  Matt Groening, decked out in one of his trademark
                Hawaiian shirts, runs in and re-autographs the scene.

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... the "Springfield Shopper" cost only five cents when Homer was born?
   ... Homer stopped to get a zoo balloon?
   ... the Mary Worth phone in the cartoonist's office?
   ... we can see Homer's "dinkie" in the photo?  [{rg} notes, "by my
       recollection this is only the second time one of THOSE has appeared on
       'The Simpsons'."  The first would be David's statue in "Itchy &
       Scratchy & Marge (7F09)" -- Ed.]

Nathan DeHoff:
   ... Skinner eats dinner with Uter's real parents, rather than his exchange
       family?
   ... the "Zoo" balloon that someone (Milhouse?) brings to the newspaper?

Don Del Grande:
   ... in the couch scene, "Matt" writes the name with his right hand? (It's
       not "mirror image" as the signature would be backwards as well)
   ... Lisa and Nelson are partners?  (Unless Lisa's partner is either
       Milhouse or Bart ...)
   ... despite Marge being allergic to seafood, she's with Homer when he
       reviews the Frying Dutchman?

Yuri Dieujuste:
   ... the tyre marks under the car in front of the Springfield Shopper
       offices?
   ... that the party for Mimi was held around 1:35 PM

Jordan Eisenberg:
   ... the Hibberts, Rev. Lovejoy, Skinner, Krabappel and Kirk are in PS?
   ... Jamey Killday sounds just like Frank Grimes?

Bruce Gomes:
   ... when Skinner is sitting at the table with Uter's parents, there are
       Beer steins on the table

Joe Green:
   ... Milhouse doesn't wear a seat belt?
   ... Planet Hype had apparently changed its name to Planet Springfield?
   ... the "Ernest Goes Straight to Video" poster?

Richard Green:
   ... Lisa now has a computer ... and it appears from the keyboard and
       "Chicago" font to be a Mac?
   ... Stampy appears?
   ... a cockroach crawls out of the lobster plate?
   ... Allison Taylor, back again!  Look for everyone's favourite 7 year old
       when the words "hot sex weekly" (this is coincidental I assume) and "I
       smell cake" are spoken.
   ... the censors were bleeping words that not only are not very offensive,
       but have been muttered on the show before -- [from the CC] dingus,
       screw, stupid, damn
   ... in Lisa's room, there was a Bleeding Gums Murphy photo?
   ... at the Planet Hype, Reverend Lovejoy was sitting at a table with & Mrs.
       Hibbert ... but where is our hero Helen?

Tony Hill:
   ... Matt Groening writes upside down?
   ... the editor has hairy arms?
   ... the Springfield Shopper is a tabloid?

Darrel Jones:
   ... Lisa drools for the first time ever?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Homer is bleeped five times in the episodes?
   ... the Star Wars and Sound of Music posters at Planet Springfield?
   ... UGLI, Krusty Burger, and Much Ado About Muffins have booths at A Taste
       of Springfield.

Ondre Lombard:
   ... Homer is the only other adult in the tour group besides Ms. Hoover?
   ... Lisa doesn't use a word like "mouth-watering" as a direct English
       variant of "aaaughllll ..."?

Patrick McGovern:
   ... this is the first time it's noted that Homer is working a part-time
       job?
   ... Planet Springfield would be competing with Planet Hype [assuming it
       wasn't just renamed -- Ed.], and Wolfcastle owns both?

Chris Palm:
   ... Hans Moleman's pink Cadillac is still smashed through the wall of
       Planet Hype/Springfield, and you can see the front end inside the
       restaurant?
   ... there's no protective glass around the "Cable Guy" script, almost as if
       someone WANTED it to be torn up?  (:-P)
   ... the C-3PO dummy in a glass case, with TIE Fighter and X-Wing models
       above it?
   ... the "Ah Fudge!" stand at the "Taste of Springfield" festival?
   ... there appears to be a Krusty Burger stand next to Much Ado About
       Muffins?
   ... Homer's eating a churro when his belly button changes?

John Plaskett:
   ... the tour guide shows a sexually explicit newspaper to minors?
   ... the food critic speaks the way she writes?
   ... Homer uses a double negative in front of the editor?
   ... the Shopper staff seems to take "Stop the presses" literally?
   ... the appearance of the bug nearly coincides with Capt. McAllister saying
       "moving?"
   ... the Frying Dutchman's closed sign seems to capitalize on Captain
       McAllister's catchphrase?
   ... the French pastry chef _stirs_ the pastry dough with a _beater?_
   ... Hans Moleman has a gruel stand and, therefore, restaurant?
   ... the Shopper's other critics are among those that give Homer his
       comeuppance?

Tom Rinschler:
   ... Janey standing behind Lisa when she is talking to Homer?
   ... there are two crabs in the tank behind OFF at the "Frying Dutchman"?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... we could hear the words "tape over" on the tape before the player
       exploded?
   ... either Homer managed to get to the Shopper on time despite the zoo
       detour, or the tour group waited for him to arrive?
   ... Homer had the same stain on his shirt for a solid week?
   ... Herbie the Love Bug hangs from the ceiling of Planet Springfield?  [See
       "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]
   ... the "Star Wars" and "Sound of Music" posters behind Rainier Wolfcastle?
   ... a Martian from "Mars Attacks!" on display at Planet Springfield?
   ... Burns, still fat, is in the crowd chasing Homer and Lisa?

Gary Wilson:
   ... Lisa doesn't know how to use word count on her computer?  She counts
       the words by hand.  [Daniel Dreibelbis responds, "I'd like to think
       that Lisa probably bought a used vintage PC or Mac from the local
       Goodwill with her allowance; that could explain why she's using a
       program with no word count." -- Ed.]
   ... the Simpsons now have a computer, but Homer doesn't know how to use it?

*  Matt Groening in couch gag scene is shown writing his name on the rug
   RIGHT-HANDED.  Simpsonus Obsessivus know that Groening is actually left-
   handed in real life.  {djm}

*  Why were parents forced to car pool to the field trip?  I thought
   Springfield had an unending fleet of buses, most of which were at least
   DRIVABLE?  {rg}

*  Why are Bart's class(the 4th grade) and Lisa's class (the 2nd) together on
   a field trip?  {er}

*  Uter did not disappear during the last field trip [Assuming the "last one"
   was the school's outing to the fort in "The PTA Disbands (2F19) -- Ed.], as
   Bart said.  There was a field trip after that, the trip to the police
   station in the military school episode.  {rg2}

c  Words bleeped out were standard euphemisms in closed captioning.  {hl}
   [See "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]

*  The ambulance that cut Homer off didn't have its siren on; doesn't that
   mean it's subject to the same rules of the road as other vehicles?  {ddg}

*  Someone obviously carried the robot dummy up to the desk.  How could they
   not notice?  {th}

+  The Springfield Shopper has gone from non-free to free and then non-free
   again.  {ddg}

*  "Screw Flanders" has two "e"s, yet Homer included the phrase repeatedly in
   his first review.  [Sarah Culp suggests he wrote, "Scroo Flandirs."  Dale
   G. Abersold thinks it might be, "Scruw Flandirs.]

*  How did Homer spell "truffle" and "bread" on his typewriter, if it doesn't
   have an "E"?  [Conceivably, Homer misspelled the words, but the copy editor
   fixed them before the articles ran -- Ed.]  {ddg}

*  Don't the Simpsons have two bathrooms (a main one, and one off the parents'
   bedroom)?  Why doesn't Lisa just use the other one?  [Michael Neylon
   responds, "I know at least as a kid, the master bathroom was OFF LIMITS for
   kids."]  {bjr}

-  The second time you see Lisa's shelves there is a globe on top of it, but
   do not appear at any other point.  {rg}

*  Since Uter is an exchange student, his parents shouldn't have been in
   Springfield, unless they got airline tickets to Springfield to search for
   their child.  {jk}

c  In the Closed Captions, Uter is spelled, "Uta."  {rg}

*  The movie, "Heartbeeps", doesn't have a mug.  {ms}

*  "Citizen Kane" did have a cane.  It's appeared in the production number at
   the cafe scene honoring Kane.  {ms}

-  The desktop ball-toy disappears from Homer's shirt.  {je}

=  The view from the revolving restaurant was much too low relative to what
   was shown on the establishing shot.  It looked like they were only on about
   the 4th floor looking out.  {th}

+  At Luigi's, Lisa had a spaghetti plate with MEATballs on it ... I will not
   believe that a place such as that would serve tofuballs.  {rg}

+  Homer's ear healed rather quickly.  (I wasn't expecting him to walk around
   with a chunk of ear missing, but it would have been funny to see a Band-Aid
   on it or something.)  {bjr}

*  By the end, Homer can write rather well without Lisa so what was his worry
   about her leaving?  (Possible explanation:  He may not have realized he
   could write without her.)  {bjr}

+  Why would Captain McAllister be mad at Homer's review of the Frying
   Dutchman?  It was written while Homer was still writing nice reviews.  {ds}

*  The Shopper is obviously no "small town paper" as Marge described it.  {th}

=  When Hans Moleman appears in the angry mob at the end of the episode, he's
   colored brown?  {cp}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Wilson Banswell:  This episode was so-so.  The idea was semi-original.  It had
   old premise of Homer gets a new job.  However, at least this job was
   something that Homer might actually have, instead of Navy Reservist or
   Trucker.  Anyway, the plot itself was pretty good.  I wish that Homer
   didn't become jerkass Homer though.  At the first act, Homer was great,
   dumb Homer.  However, he transformed into Jerkass Homer in the second act.
   Also, many of the second and third act "jokes" fell flat. Overall, this
   would be a C+, for the great couch gag, and the running Uter gag.  (C+)

Nate Birch:  Al Jean is very quickly becoming my favorite writer of the later
   seasons, with the possible exception of Dan Greaney.  [Ironically, Jean was
   one of the show's *first* writers -- Ed.] This episode was like a lot of
   other episodes from season 10 and 11, it was all about Homer getting a new
   job, filled with "wacky" physical humor, but for some reason, unlike
   "Beyond Blunderdome", this episode's wackiness didn't bug me.  I found that
   almost everything that happened seemed plausible, even though I'm not sure
   why.  [...]  This episode seemed a lot less frantic than other recent
   episodes.  On top of this it was one of the funniest episodes since season
   9, I laughed from beginning to end, which is what a good Simpsons is
   supposed to do.  So far best episode of season 11, and season 10.  (A+)

Nathan DeHoff:  In "Maximum Homerdrive," Homer complained that his adventures
   almost always resulted in someone trying to kill him.  I'd say that this
   was one of my complaints about this episode.  In fact, much about this
   episode had been done before; it was pretty much standard "Homer gets a new
   job" fare.  This new job was one of the more plausible ones he's had
   recently, though, and it allowed for some amusing scenes, many of which
   occurred in restaurants that had been featured in previous episodes.  It
   was pretty good as far as typical "Homer's new job" episodes go.  (C+)

Don Del Grande:  This started out as a good episode, but when it changed from
   "Homer likes everything" to "Homer makes it a point not to like anything,
   and everyone around him hates him as a result", the show lost its edge --
   and the "Homer is about to kill himself, but at the last second everything
   pretty much turns out OK" gets old after seeing it happen to Fry pretty
   much every week on "Futurama".  And what was with "We'll be right back"?
   (B-)

Nicolas Di Candia:  This episode would probably have seemed better if there
   had not been that many "Homer gets a job" episodes recently (this was the
   second episode of this kind this season, and it was the third episode of
   the season).  This particular job fits more to Homer's character (which is
   more than what we can say about Hollywood consultant, bodyguard or
   trucker).  Some nice gags (I loved the "non-fat" bit at the end) and a good
   use of Lisa, which has not been frequent lately, help this episode to get a
   B in my book.  (B)

Jordan Eisenberg:  This season has been pretty shallow, but hasn't once lost
   its comedic energy so far.  Tonight's was rewatchably great.  However, a
   lot of the lines seemed to be lifted directly from previous episodes (see
   "Previous Eps.")  More than a few times, I was distracted from the show
   because it struck me that a line was quoted verbatim from an old episode by
   the very same character.  I thought the Homer-is-hunted ending would have
   been more suspenseful had the show been less detached from reality up to
   that point.  As it stood, I didn't really seem to care if Homer was going
   to be killed or not!  Funny episode nonetheless.  I loved the humor about
   newspapers and telemarketing.  (B+)

Richard Green:  Okay ... ANOTHER Homer gets a new job episode ... fabulous.
   Honestly, I think this was one of the worst "jobs" yet, and didn't even
   really have many funny moments.  While I'll admit that this episode is at
   least as good as the other 2 we've seen so far (even though we've yet to
   actually see a REAL Season 11 ep), it was really still really lacking the
   charm that the show used to have [...].  This episode DID has some funny
   moments, the fake Homer at SNPP scene comes to mind the fastest, but as
   usual they were mostly in the first act and one or two in the second, and
   the third act just plain sucked.  The "conspire to murder Homer" theme
   really didn't work at all ... was that scene in The Frying Dutchmen
   extremely longs, or was it just me?  (C)

Tony Hill:  Well, this was a pretty good episode.  Makes me wish they'd used
   it as the season premiere instead of "Beyond Blunderdome."  The big
   question is, whatever did they do to Ed Asner's voice?  The "no
   comeuppance" scene was SO funny.  I was just thinking Homer's comeuppance
   is what the third act was for when Homer said "we'll be right back."
   ROTFL!!!  The pork chop scene was utterly predictable, but otherwise this
   is good for an  (A)

Carl Johnson:  Impressive beginning disintegrates not far into act two.  The
   gags in the latter part were corny and half-buttocked, the story died out
   as soon as Homer caved in to peer pressure.  Much was going for this
   episode, but it, like Lance Murdoch, managed to fall back into the
   shark-infested water after coming so close to success.  (D+)

Darrel Jones:  Another great entry from Season Eleven.  I don't understand why
   the nay-sayers hate these episodes.  Act One was chock-full of great gags,
   especially Homer's "replacement" and the "stop the presses!" bit.  I also
   liked the use of Lisa; this is more exposure than she's gotten lately.  The
   mob ending was freakin' hilarious!  Only thing keeping this ep from an A+
   is the "Homer's beeping" part; what the hell was that?  (A)

Joe Klemm:  The opening act, with the school going on a field trip to the
   newspaper HQ, was clever and a very funny way to start the episode.  It
   loses some steam when during the second act, yet the writers prevent this
   from being an "asshole Homer" episode by coming up with a clever third act
   bit where Springfield's restaurant owners plot to kill Homer.  However, I
   definitely find the ending, where most of Springfield chase Homer and Lisa,
   to be unnecessary and a dumb way to end the episode.  (B-)

Ondre Lombard:  Once again, I can count on two hands (maybe one) how many good
   jokes I thought there were, and it'd take too long to go into the ones I
   hated.  [...]  To critique the episode on a whole rather than just
   particularly, the way the episode flows fails to sell Homer the restaurant
   critic and therefore makes it just yet another stupid, far fetched job for
   him with another stupid, nefarious and outrageous ending. At the risk of
   seeming negative just to be different like Homer was, I say this was a
   rather bad episode.  (D+)

Adam Long:  Well, it wasn't anything too special, but I liked it.  Sure it was
   another predictable "Homer-Gets-A-New-Job-And-Wackiness-Ensues" episode,
   but at least this time it was a believable job for him.  Lots of good stuff
   in the first act, and the second act wasn't without its charm, but the
   third act and ending were generally pretty weak (except for "Thar, She
   Blows" which was downright hilarious, IMHO).  I found it a bit dull from
   the assassination planning on.  Krusty as King Lear could've been a lot
   funnier than it was as well (though I did like the "Worst King Lear in 400
   years" headline).  All in all I found the episode pretty entertaining, but
   I think it had the potential to be better.  (B+)

Patrick McGovern:  Alright, it was far fetched, and LOTS of the gags didn't
   work (see: Homer Cursing, Stop the Presses!, the meeting in the Frying
   Dutchman etc), but I really can't believe how much I LAUGHED here.  Even
   stuff that normally would make me want to wretch (like the collection of
   catty shrew critics), seemed to work here.  Not great, but still funny
   IMNSHO.  (C+)

John Plaskett:  Three episodes into the eleventh season and I am not pleased.
   The episode started off groin-grabbingly good, but the quality cesdended.
   The episode was only sorta good, not lexcesant. Well, I think it's safe to
   say that the UN has done its job. Screw Flanders. Screw Flanders. Screw
   Flanders. Screw Flanders. Screw Flanders. Screw Flanders. Screw Flanders.
   Screw Flanders.  (C+)

Abhi Ray:  Episodes like this make me scratch my head and wonder WHY did the
   writers decide to write garbage like this.  [...]  Honestly, how much humor
   can be found in Homer's new job as a food critic?  We got a few jokes on
   the restaurant business, but the rest of the time is occupied by an
   overbearing obnoxious Homer, and jokes that just came out of nowhere for no
   reason but to fill the time (like Homer suddenly watching Patty and Selma
   exercising).  The Homer plot in which he's a food critic is totally
   lifeless, like most of the AABF series.  He gets a job after singing,
   writes good reviews, everyone likes it, then he writes bad reviews, then
   the restaurant business goes down.  Well, at least there is a faint glimmer
   of good writing, once we get to the scene with assassins trying to kill
   Homer, but I still scratched my head and asked WHY?  (D)

Tom Rinschler:  A very funny episode!  Usually episodes where Homer gets a new
   job are often (rightly) hated by this group, but this time, the job he
   takes makes perfect sense.  I enjoyed the Lisa-Homer interplay in this
   episode, as well as several ROFL scenes (The "missing Uter" scenes for
   example).  I also liked the first look into the "Springfield Shopper" as
   well as the fact the writers resurrected every restaurant and restaurant
   owner in the long history of OFF.  Only a few jarring scenes (such as the
   "beeping scene") marred this episode.  (A-)

Matt Rose:  Since it's obvious the show's not the same anymore, I've decided
   to be more lenient and just watch it on one level.  And it does alright in
   that department. I'm just disappointed in how this episode seems to run
   together with so many before it.  I mean, the "Homer gets a new job" thing
   is so run into the ground now; they aren't fooling anybody.  I enjoyed a
   lot of the restaurant jokes and characters ("The French Confection", that's
   a good one).  I really think though that there wasn't a lot of effort
   behind this episode to make it funny, just like so many others of the
   Scully era.  It seemed like this one was pretty half-assed all the way
   around.  (C)

Eric Sansoni:  Quite possibly the funniest of the AABF series.  I was laughing
   too often and too hard to think about whether this was too Homer-centric or
   just another "new job" episode.  One example of many laugh-out-loud
   moments: "9 thumbs up, what was that?"  Al Jean offers more proof that the
   best Simpsons writer is a veteran Simpsons writer, with his best solo
   episode to date.  This is the funny Homer I love, the slow-witted but
   well-intentioned American male, who tries his best but never quite gets the
   entire point all at once.  Act three was closer to a McBain parody than a
   "fractured take on modern life," but the humor throughout was in fine
   classic tradition without being derivative.  (A-)

Mike Smith:  Another well-written episode from Al Jean.  An A!  SCREW
   FLANDERS.  (A)

Dan Touchette:  This episode shows how important supporting characters are to
   the show's quality in its longevity.  The writers can explore these lesser
   people for fresh ideas.  Homer the food critic didn't show me anything new
   -- but who knew the town's restaurateurs were sinister enough to consider
   assassination?  Not a great episode, but it does make me wonder which
   subjects "The Simpsons" has yet to lampoon.  (B-)

Yours Truly:  Unlike the critics at the Shopper, I enjoy writing about
   episodes I like more than I do about shows that disappoint me, and I liked
   tonight's show.  Nice writing balance keeps the story grounded enough to be
   believable (until the third act, which is a little over the top), and
   there's some great scenes with Homer and Lisa.  Ed Asner is excellent as a
   gruff newspaper editor (what else?).  Something of a throwback to the days
   where the show relied on finely-tuned dialogue and situations and
   intelligent humor, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner" is a tasty
   morsel that I have no troubles recommending.  (A-)

"Margaritaville" by Jimmy Buffett  {hl}


>> Meta-reference corner

Tony Hill:  Right before commercial, Homer says, "We'll be right back."

   Later, he says, "Something bad happens when I go anyplace."


>> WAR AND PEACE: Two Thumbs Down

Jeff Cross sums up the truth behind this episode:  It seems that critics and
   the public are never on the same wavelength.  Whatever the public likes,
   the critics despise, and vice versa.  I remember in the summer of 1997 that
   BOSTON GLOBE film critic Jay Carr hated every movie that came out save
   ULEE'S GOLD and, for some inexplicable reason, FACE/OFF.

   I think the reason critics hate everything is because they stop to analyze
   whatever they're reviewing rather than going along with the visceral thrill
   that everybody else gets.  When I was an entertainment critic for my
   college newspaper, I was very much like Homer in giving good reviews to
   most of what I saw or read.  Eventually they wanted me to analyze why it
   was good; when I did, I wasn't having as much fun anymore than when I was
   just enjoying the ride.


>> "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize" and "I&S&P" -- separated at birth

Michael K. Neylon ponders:  Ok, I might be pushing it here ... however, I'd
   like to argue that this recent episode has ties to Itchy and Scratchy and
   Pootie in that it makes jabs at us.

   Some of these include: (a) the sudden reference to Homers job, (b) the
   continuity with regards to the missing Uter, and (c) the entire idea of
   "critics" that start with excellent reviews early, then make very mean
   takes.

   The last one is particularly pointing fingers to people like Ondre and
   those that prefer the older episodes.  However, unlike I&S&P, when the
   writers say that the critics reviews don't matter, this episode says that
   the bad reviews ruin the show, and the writers would like to get back at
   us.  Ok, so this is a stretch, but the poor connections in this episode
   really make me think that there was a message here.


Capel Cleggs:  The problem with that analogy, I think, is that the actual
   critics-- the people who write about TV for newspapers and magazines, and
   are therefore the direct equivalents of Homer's food-critic job--are still
   praising the show to the skies.  I doubt that the net reviews (which are
   predominantly negative) matter more to the writers than to the professional
   reviews (which are almost always positive).  Also, in this episode we see
   that Homer's negative food-reviews are the equivalent of a TV critic who
   trashes bad TV shows (though Homer is furious at that critic for doing so).
   So this episode isn't about someone who writes negative reviews of a
   prestigious product (like "The Simpsons"), but rather about someone (Homer)
   who goes from liking everything indiscriminately to acquiring a more
   "sophisticated palate."  It's about how Homer's taste improves, and the
   moral appears to be that having good taste is dangerous!


Eric Sansoni:  If there is any commentary on the quality of criticism, it's
   that too much of anything is no good.  Homer goes from liking everything to
   hating everything. Not once is he ever in balance.  If you think that his
   second style of criticism was actually the appropriate way to do the job,
   it's no wonder you're drawn to [alt.tv.simpsons].  ;-)


>> INHERIT THE WIND: The Next Generation

Jeff Cross:  In 1999, the Kansas Board of Education decided to take a
   backwards step in science by discontinuing the teaching of evolution.
   Their logic for this move is that the theory of evolution was "dogmatic."


Evan Ross adds:  Another state, I forget which, has also gone through and
   replaced "evolution" with "change over time."


Benjamin Robinson:  For years, people have argued whether or not creationism
   (the belief that everything in the universe was created directly by God in
   six days) should be taught in schools, either alongside or in place of
   evolution.  Also for years, the courts have ruled that creationism, being a
   purely religious doctrine, could not be taught in public schools without
   violating the separation of church and state.  The Kansas Board of
   Education recently introduced a new wrinkle -- evolution was no longer a
   required part of the cirriculum.  Science teachers inside and outside the
   state immediately assailed the decision as wrong-headed and unscientific.
   (In fairness, I should note that the board is apparently not actively
   preventing the teaching of evolution.)  The decision hit the news only a
   couple months ago, so either someone on the "Simpsons" staff had to hustle
   to insert a last-minute reference, or the writers got very lucky with
   "predicting" the news.


>> At least they didn't call it the Springfield Times-Post-Globe-Herald-Jewish News-Hot Sex Weekly

Benjamin Robinson:  (Actually, they couldn't call it that, since it's a daily
   paper.)  The tour guide mentioned that the Springfield Shopper bought out
   six other publications, to become the town's #1 newspaper (presumably by
   default).  In this respect, the Shopper reflects a trend toward newspaper
   consolidation seen in the rest of the country.  At around the turn of the
   century, it wasn't unusual to for a major city like New York to have five
   or six newspapers.  Slowly, the news landscape began to change.
   Television, radio, "USA Today," magazines, and now the internet competed
   with the traditional newspapers to provide people with their daily
   headlines, Lotto numbers, and celebrity scandals.  Readership dwindled, and
   papers either merged with other papers, or folded altogether.  Today, only
   the largest metropolises have more than one mainstream newspaper (leaving
   aside underground and niche publications).


>> Ooh, someone call the "South Park" writers

Jordan Eisenberg:  It's funny ... Homer's words in the beginning were bleeped
   out, but none of them were actually curses!  From the CC:  (Words in
   [brackets] were bleeped.)

   "Hey, you [dingus], you cut me off!  Ah, yeah, [screw] you!" ... "[Stupid]
   Ambulance!  You think you're so big with your [damn] [<extra beep>] siren
   and your letters on backwards!"


>> V-E Day

Benjamin Robinson explains one of the more cryptic newspaper headlines:  "V-E"
   day refers to "Victory in Europe," marking the defeat of the European
   portion of the Axis powers in World War II.  In a similar vein, "V-J"
   refers to "Victory in Japan," which was [also] the end of the war.


>> Where's Johnny Videoarcadeseed when you need him?

Tom Rinschler explains the inspiration for "Johnny Newspaperseed":  Johnny
   Appleseed was a semi-legendary character in the American Midwest. He
   traveled throughout the area when it was just being settled, planting apple
   seeds so that the area would have plenty of the fruit.


>> Oh, so I guess they're not the same person

Tony Hill:  Ann Landers and Dear Abby, formerly the Friedman twins of Sioux
   City, Iowa, have been competing advice columnists since 1955.  Their real
   names are Esther Pauline (Eppie) Lederer [Ann] and Pauline Esther (Popo)
   Phillips [Abby]. They celebrated their 81st birthdays this past July 4.
   (Please don't ask me how I remember all this.)


Todd Emerson:  They're also notorious for helping to spread urban legends,
   mostly sent in by readers who claim, "This really happened to me!"


>> A particular thing is missing in his writing, but what?

 - or, I *Don't* want no stinkin' nonconsonant.

Homer isn't the first fellow to try getting by without an "e", as Tony Hill
   explains:  Writing something without using a certain letter of the alphabet
   is called an oulip. Just for fun, I once rewrote the Gettysburg Address
   without using the letter E. You can read it at
   http://www.nyx.net/~thill/gettysbg.noe.  (Wow, that's two plugs for stuff
   at my website in one capsule.)


Andrew Gill:  Bill is right.  Although an Anglican work usually contains a
   majority of a nonconsonant (fifth in a chain of 26), it's not crucial.
   G*org*s P*r*c omits this nonconsonant whilst scribing _A Void_, about 300
   pp. of book in Bourbon lingua franca.  Gilb*rt Adair did soon transform _A
   Void_ into an Anglican manuscript, still sans the fifth.

   Quoth a black bird, "Not again!"

   Perec also wrote another novel that used only the letter e (plus
   consonants.)


Haynes Lee shows us how this might work:  [Ernest Wright's "Gadsby" is a]
   novel written entirely without using the letter e. Here's an excerpt from
   page one

   "If youth, throughout all history, had a champion to stand up for it; to
   show a doubting world that a child can think; and, possibly, do it
   practically; you wouldn't constantly run across folks today who claim that
   'a child don't know anything.'  A child's brain starts functioning at
   birth; and has, amongst its many infant convolutions, thousands of dormant
   atoms, into which  God has put a mystic possibility for noticing an adults
   act, and figuring out its purport."

   ... and the last page

   "A glorious full moon sails across a sky without a cloud.  A crisp night
   air has folks turning up coat collars and kids hopping up and down for
   warmth.  And that giant star, Sirius, winking slyly, knows that soon, now,
   that light up in His Honors room window will go out.  Fttt!  It *is* out!
   So, as Sirius and Luna hold an all-night vigil, I'll say a soft 'Goodnight'
   to all our happy bunch, and to John Gadsby -- Youth's Champion.

   Finis."


>> Sadly, she missed her chance to get an Apple Lisa

Benjamin Robinson comments on a Simpson family milestone:  With little
   fanfare, it appears that Lisa has gotten a computer.  Aw, I was hoping for
   a "the Simpsons get a computer" story.  Note also that Lisa evidently has a
   Windows-based PC, even though she strikes me as more of a Mac person.


>> The film that almost killed Jim Carrey's career

Joe Klemm:  If there's one film Jim Carrey should have made second thoughts to
   when it comes to his 1994+ career, it has to be the "Cable Guy."  A 1996
   dark comedy, the film stars Carrey as a maniac posing as a worker of a
   cable system who makes life miserable for Matthew Broderick.  The film,
   which was Jim's first film to have him make $20 million for working on it,
   was a bomb in the box office, yet Carrey was about to prove he still had
   the stuff months later with "Liar, Liar."


>> Hidden messages?

Jordan Eisenberg wonders:  Does anyone else think this is a comment from some
   of the Simpsons writers who labor over a script in a group effort, only for
   the "Written By" credit to go to a single person?

   Lisa: "Wow, my first published article ... although someone else's name is
   on it."

   Homer: "Welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing."


>> ¿Donde esta Uter?

 - (Sorry, I don't know any German)

Many people pondered Uter's fate.  Like Ernie Smith, for example:  Hey, keep
   in mind that Uter hasn't been seen since the Civil War ep.  :)


"woozywink":  I think it was in reference to "The PTA Disbands" because they
   mentioned it happened on the school's last field trip.  I guess the writers
   either forgot about his small cameo in "Much Apu About Nothing"  or just
   felt it ruined the joke.


Pete Klassen:  He also appeared in "Mayored to the Mob", wearing a "Futurama"
   T-shirt.


"nevets14":  Uter was also seen at the Health Fair in "Bart Star" trying to do
   a sit-up.


Nathan DeHoff:  Maybe Uter just has bad luck with field trips in general.


"G. B. R.":  Maybe they just wanted to get rid of the character like Bleeding
   Gums and Dr. Monroe.


Noting how long it took for Uter's parents to go looking for him, Al Denton
   writes:  Hey, yeah.  Maybe Uter's mom was so busy with the Olympic
   committee thing that she didn't have time to spend with her child. . .so,
   like any normal parent would do, she put him up in an exchange program

   But now, since many Olympic committee officials are being kicked out
   because of charges of accepting bribes, she can finally spend time with
   Uter.  That's why she just noticed now that he's missing.


>> Sprechen Sie Deutsch?  (Okay, so I got this one from Babelfish.)

Claus Rasmussen:  I'm not 100% sure about this, my downloaded RM-video is in
   pretty crappy quality, but I thought Uter's father said "Wer ist Uter?",
   rather than "Where is Uter?".

   If true, this an error because "Wer ist Uter?" is actually German for
   "_Who_ is Uter?". If he wanted to know where his son was, he should have
   asked "Wo ist Uter?"


>> Planet Car Watch

Benjamin Robinson:  Herbie the Love Bug appears at Planet Springfield (hanging
   from the roof), and in the "Beyond Blunderdome" museum.  This isn't a goof,
   since more than one Herbie the Love Bug VW was created to make the movie.
   (By the way, the other car at PS is a 1959 Cadillac, which is the signature
   vehicle for the Hard Rock Café restaurants.)  [{cp}:  "It also used to
   belong to Hans Moleman. :-P"]

   Speaking of cars, Hot Wheels are small metal toy cars sold here in America
   (and maybe other places as well).  They're similar to Matchboxes, if you
   have those where you live.  I agree with Homer; they aren't good pizza
   toppings.


>> Critics' Casualties

 - "Platypus Man"

Ondre Lombard:  Platypus Man was one of the first three programs to air on UPN
   in 1995, and one of the first two sitcoms.  It starred comedian Richard
   Jeni as "The Platypus Man" and was a very run-of-the-mill dating comedy.


 - "The Cosby Mysteries"

Ondre, again:  Soon after Bill Cosby's remake of "You Bet Your Life" failed,
   he did a series on CBS in the 1994-1995 season in which he played yet
   another elderly crime solver.  The series did poorly both critically and
   Nielsen-wise and got cancelled.


>> The 4th wall falls: "We'll be right back"

Mike Juren:  With Homer's "We'll be right back," this is the first time one of
   the Simpsons has faced the audience and addressed them DURING the episode
   in REFERRING to the episode itself as an episode.  ["ungvichian" remembers
   that Bart talked directly to the audience at the end of "Bart the General
   (7G05)" -- Ed.]  All the other times the audience was addressed, it had to
   do with the action INSIDE the episode.  Once they came close during the end
   of "Who shot Mr. Burns", with the characters asking the audience to figure
   out the mystery in the episode, but it turned out they weren't asking the
   audience at all but talking to Chief Wiggum.  This just goes to show how
   much admirable restraint the writers and creators have had to have
   exercised to not have done this for 101/2 seasons and then finally when
   they do use it to use it for a cheap laugh as if it were no big deal, when
   it was really a great shock to those who have closely watched the show in
   its 101/2 season run.

   Early in the century there was a playwright named Berthold Brecht who I
   believe may have pioneered the practice of talking to the audience about
   the play as a play.  I think they called it "tearing down the fourth wall"
   or "using the fourth wall" because a play normally only has three walls
   that the actors need to worry about.


Eric Sansoni:  It may have bothered you, but as you state above, this is a
   tried-and-true comedic principle.  Used judiciously, and perhaps sparingly,
   it is a good device for providing an additional layer of commentary on the
   action.  Another classic comedy that made use of it: Ferris Bueller's Day
   Off.  The moment on the show tonight was very funny to me, probably because
   the gag had nothing to do with the breaking of the 4th wall.  It was just
   the strongest way to underline Homer's arrogance, by subtly indicating that
   after 200+ shows he's awfully ignorant not to realize these kind of things
   get settled in the 3rd act.


About who acknowledged the fourth wall, David Brunt wrote:  Yes Brecht is the
   first who acknowledged the fourth wall (1928 if you want to be precise, I
   can give you the play title, first performance, all the chapter and verse
   if you want).  1928, a good ten years after Oliver Hardy was going the same
   thing.


>> My entry for the "I sure hope someone got fired for that one" contest

Actually, Seth Miller's entry:  In [tonight's episode], the French Chef states
   that his eclair contains One million calories.  Rudimentary knowledge of
   nutrition sciences tells us that the most calorific substance is fat, at 9
   calories per gram.  Since there are approximately 28 grams in an ounce and
   16 ounces in a pound, 1,000,000 divided by 9 divided by 28 divided by 16
   tells us that the eclair, were it 100% fat, would weigh approximately 248
   pounds.  Assuming that it contains SOME non calorific matter and SOME less
   calorie dense carbohydrates, namely the sugar and flour that an eclair MUST
   contain, we can assume that the eclair weighs AT LEAST 300 pounds, which it
   clearly didn't, and, since eclairs are not particularly dense (in terms of
   sheer mass divided by volume), it would be at LEAST as large as a full
   grown human male.  Is this supposed to be some sort of <snicker> MAGICAL
   pastry?

   OF COURSE, he could have been, for no good reason, using proper calories
   instead of nutritional calories, which are in fact kilocalories, but this
   is improper for the given application.


Sam Bell suggests:  Maybe it contained (2,4,6)trinitrotoluene, which has very
   high enthalpy per gram


Jordan Eisenberg:  That might explain why the pastry exploded after Homer
   threw it.


Ostap Bender:  Actually, it wouldn't.  TNT isn't shock-sensitive.  That's why
   grenades have fuses (and pencils have erasers).  Besides, that éclair
   didn't explode.  It just fell into a smoking crater.


Seth Miller, again:  I was still referring to DIETETIC calories, and very few
   people are actually able to digest such poison AND convert it into
   calories.  [...]  I JUST LOOKED UP THE SYMPTOMS OF POISONING FROM
   TRINITROTOLUENE: "Yellow skin, hair and nails."

> Quotes and Scene Summary  {bg}
==============================================================================
% Ever wonder why Springfield Elementary's test scores are so low?  
% Maybe it's because the students are too busy going on field trips to 
% learn anything.  This time, the students are off to visit the local 
% newspaper.

Skinner:	I hope you all enjoy your ride to and tour of the
		Springfield Shopper newspaper.  Groundskeeper Willie and I
		will stay behind to remove all traces of asbestos and the
		word "evolution" from our school.
Willie:		[comes out of the school, wearing a Hawaiian shirt] Next 
		stop, Margaritaville!  [notices the students]  Oh, they're
		still here.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Skinner tries to marshal the students for the trip.

Skinner:	Now, I'd like to ask each child to pair up with a buddy so
		no one gets lost.
Bart:		Come to think of it I haven't seen Uter since the last
		field trip.
Skinner:	Uter.  I don't remember any Uter.  Silly name, Uter.
-- Must be some sort of magic Uter, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize
   Dinner?"

% Several parents -- Homer included -- have volunteered to take the 
% students on the field trip.  Lisa wonders how Homer was able to get 
% away from the demands of his job.  He assures her he's got it 
% covered.
%
% Cut to scene at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.  We find a terrible 
% mock-up of Homer (bucket head, tree branches with gloves on them, 
% cassette tape player on lap) sitting in his chair.

Homer:	[voice on cassette, singing]
	I work hard for the money
	So hard for the money
	Oh, I something, something money,
	Come on give me lots of honey
Burns:	Well, there's an employee, Smithers.  A smile on his lips 
	and a song in his heart.  Promote him.
-- Career advancement the Homer way, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize
   Dinner?"

% Cut to scene of same mock-up of Homer in chair now sitting in an 
% office.  After a few seconds of garbled song resulting from the 
% dying batteries in the cassette player, a spark shoots out and 
% starts a fire in the office.
%
% Meanwhile, the real Homer drives Milhouse, Nelson, Bart, and Lisa.  
% Despite having to share the road with Springfield's intrepid 
% ambulance corps, Homer makes it safely to the zoo.

Homer:	Here we are, kids.  The zoo.
[?]Bart:	Well, that's great Dad, except you were suppose to drive
	us to the newspaper.
Homer:	D'oh!  [echoing]
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Homer gets to the Shopper just in time for the start of the tour of 
% Springfield Shopper.

Guide:	Welcome to the Springfield Shopper, established in 1883. 
	The newspaper was founded by Johnny Newspaperseed, a 14
	year-old boy who roamed America founding newspapers.
Homer:	If he's so smart, how come he's dead?
Guide:	Over the years, the Shopper merged with the Springfield
	Times, Post, Globe, Herald, Jewish News and Hot Sex Weekly
	to become Springfield's number one newspaper.
-- Is this how Rupert Murdoch got started?  "Guess Who's Coming to
   Criticize Dinner?"

% Lisa looks at the rows of cubicles with busy reporters, and marvels 
% at the journalistic activity.  The camera pans past the cubicles to 
% reveal the "reporters" are just telemarketers trying to sell 
% subscriptions.
%
% The tour stops at a solitary man in a small room, working at an 
% easel.

Guide:	And this is our comic strip department.  Who here reads
	"Mary Worth"?
	[everyone is silent]
	Let's move on.
	[they do, and the man slumps across his easel in
	frustration]
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Next stop:  Two elderly twins in stasis tubes.

Guide:		This is where we store Ann Landers and Dear Abby for 
		their 23 hours of daily sleep.
Ann Landers:	My advice is to free us or to let us die
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Elsewhere in the newsroom, Homer and Bart stand in front of a kiosk.  
% It contains a terminal that can display front pages of "Shopper" 
% back issues.

Bart:	Check it out Dad, you can print out the headline from the
	day you were born
Homer:	Ooh, pointless nostalgia!
	[keys in his birth date.  A paper appears showing a Homer-
	like baby with the headline, "Unusually Large, Ugly Baby
	Born"]
	I'd sure hate to be him!  Eeew!
-- It sucks to be you, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% The tour has moved to the press area.  The guide proudly points out 
% each copy contains "a certain percentage" of recycled newsprint.  
% She seems less proud when Lisa makes her admit that the "certain 
% percentage" is zero.  Outside, entire trees (including a boy in a 
% treehouse) are fed into the printing plant as raw material.
%
% Homer smells something tastier that post-consumer recycled paper.

Homer:	Hey, I smell cake!  Cake that says [sniffs air] farewell
	and [sniffs again] best wishes!
Nelson:	Your old man has an awesome nose.
Bart:	Oh, that's nothing.  He can hear pudding.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% What Homer smells is the spread laid out for the Shopper's food 
% critic, who's retiring today.

Editor:	So, Mimi, this little shindig is our way of saying
	farewell to our favourite food critic.
Mimi:	What can I say, except thanks for the predictable
	champagne, pizza that's hardly numero uno and ice-cream
	cake that reminds us why make 31 flavours when you can't
	get vanilla right?
Editor:	I wouldn't want to be married to her.  I mean, again.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Homer comes by and samples the wares, much to Mimi's ire.

Mimi:	Who are you and why are you ruining my retirement party?
Homer:	I'll have you know I wandered off from the tour.
Editor:	Well, at least you like the food.
Homer:	Oh, I like food alright ...
	[Homer breaks into song]
	I like pizza, I like bagels,
	I like hot gods with mustard and beer
Editor:	I get the picture
Homer:	[continues, ignoring him]
	I'll eat eggplant,
	I could even eat a baby deer
	La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
	Who's that baby deer on the lawn there?
Editor:	Enough already!
Homer:	Sorry.
Editor:	Hey listen, I just had a thought.  We're looking for a new
	food critic.  Someone who doesn't immediately pooh-pooh
	everything he eats.
Homer:	No, it usually takes a few hours.
Editor:	Look, I'd like to give you a tryout.  Write a 500-word
	sample review, if it passes muster we'll put you on staff.
Homer:	Thanks for the chance.  You won't never regret this Mr.
	Editing-guy.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Back at Home ...

Marge:	You know Homey, The "E" doesn't work on that typewriter.
Homer:	We don't need no stinkin' "E".
	Restaurant Review? ... no.
	Eatery Evaluation? ... no.
	Food Box:  Go or No Go by Homer ... no ... Earl! ... no
	... Bill Simpson.
-- "Guss Who's Coming To Criticiz Dinnr?"

% Bill, er, Homer submits his review to Mr. Editing Guy.

Editor:	[laughs]
Homer:	Well, what do you think?
Editor:	This is a joke, right?  I mean this is the stupidest thing
	I've ever read!
Homer:	What's wrong with it?
Editor:	You keep using words like "Pasghetti" and "Momatoes"  You
	make numerous threatening references to the UN and at the
	end you repeat the words "Screw Flanders" over and over
	again.
Homer:	Oh, it's so hard to get to 500 words.
-- Even harder without an "e" key, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize
   Dinner?"

% The Editor is just about to tell Homer he isn't working out, when 
% Homer promises to come back with the "real" review.  He goes home, 
% but all he can do is to hole up in the bathroom, trying to scrub off 
% the stink of failure.  Lisa, desperate to answer Nature's call, 
% promises to help Homer with his article in exchange for bathroom 
% access.
%
% Later that night, Lisa makes good on her promise.  She and Homer sit 
% in front of the computer in her room.

Homer:	OK, what restaurant did we review?
Lisa:	Well, we went to Pate LaBelle last week, how about that?
Homer:	Great, now let me think.  The food was ... [Homer tastes
	his food-stained shirt to remind himself of the
	restaurant] ... was not un-delicious
Lisa:	[typing] The food is delicious.
Homer:	Ooh!  That's brilliant!  And they had this sweet, sweet
	chocolate mousse.  Really, the only word to describe it is
	[drools lustily].
Lisa:	Hmm. What's the English equivalent for [imitates Homer]? 
	I'd say ... transcendent.
Homer:	How about groin-grabbingly transcendent?
Lisa:	Uh ... I don't think so.
Homer:	We make a good team.  A groin-grabbingly good team!
	[... a little later ...]
Lisa:	497 ... 498 words.
Homer:	How about screw Flanders!
Lisa:	Bon Appetite!
Homer:	Ah, they're both good.
-- Great collaborations, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Back at Springfield Shopper ...

Editor:	[reading Homer's review] Not bad, not bad at all!  We're
	going to run this on page one ... of section H-2.
Homer:	Whoo-hoo!  Stop the presses!
	[Man hits stop button, wrecking havoc in the plant]
Homer:	OK, Start the presses.
Editor:	That takes four hours.
Homer:	Whatever, I'll be at Moe's.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:33]
%
% Homer, along with his family, dives right into his new job.

Marge:		This is so exciting Homey, your first restaurant
		review.
Homer:		Marge, Shh. It's important that no one knows I'm a
		food critic.
Ned:		Hear that Maude?  Homer's a critic!
Maude:		Homer's a critic, pass it on!
Skinner:	Did you hear?  Homer's a critic.
Uter's Father:	Quit changing the subject.  Where is Uter?
Uter's Mother:	Oh, we just want closure.
-- Did *you* ever come to the wrong place, "Guess Who's Coming to
   Criticize Dinner?"

% Captain McAllister brings by Homer's dinner (the "critic special") 
% personally.  Homer can't believe his good luck -- being paid to eat!  
% The only way it could get better, according to Bart, is if Homer 
% could draw a salary for scratching his butt.
%
% The Shopper duly publishes Homer's next review ("Cod is Great, Scrod 
% is Good").  Lisa reads it contentedly.

Lisa:	Wow, my first published article ... although someone
	else's name is on it.
Homer:	Welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. 
	But this is only the beginning.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Indeed it is.  The Simpsons visit Planet Springfield, a Hollywood-
% themed restaurant decorated with knick-knacks like a coffee mug from 
% "HeartBeeps" and the cane from "Citizen Kane."  ("Wait a minute," 
% Lisa realizes, "there's was no cane in 'Citizen Kane!'")  Later, 
% Homer reviews Springfield's famous revolving restaurant.  He likes 
% both the food and the view -- until Homer's table rotates past Patty 
% and Selma's apartment.
%
% Reviewing Springfield's eateries brings Homer an unexpected benefit 
% -- the respect of the townspeople.

Lenny:	Hey Homer, great call on that chicken place!  And on that
	rib place!  I never knew everything was so good!
Homer:	Look Marge, I'm making a difference in people's lives!
	[we see that all of Springfield's denizens have become
	overweight]
Burns:	Yes Simpson, your love of food is contagious.  I've never
	felt jollier!  [bone crunching sound]  Oooh.  There go my
	shinbones again.
-- Making a *big* difference, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize
   Dinner?"

% Meanwhile, at the Springfield Shopper ...

Editor:		Hey Homer, c'mere.
Homer:		Oh ... are you going to fire my for swiping office
		supplies?
Editor:		No.
		[Homer grabs something off someone's desk and puts it
		under his shirt]
		Some of your fellow critics wanted to meet you.  This is
		Garth Tralawney, TV critic.
Homer:		Why you, you made them cancel "Platypus Man!"  [shakes
		Tralawney]
Editor:		Homer!  This is our theatre critic, Daphne Beaumont
Homer:		[shaking the TV critic again]
		... and the "Cosby Mysteries."  That show had limitless
		possibilities!
Editor:		Homer, please!
Homer:		Sorry.
Killday:	Jamie Killday, farm supply critic.  Just got back from the
		gopher poison show in Paris.  Let me tell you something,
		people, the days of clubbing them with a baseball bat are
		[emphasis] over.
Homer:		For you, perhaps.
Tralawney:	Listen, we've been meaning to have a talk with you about
		your reviews.  Everything's a rave!  Nine thumbs up, what
		the hell is that?
Homer:		I've given out my share of bad reviews
Beaumont:	Oh, the only bad review you gave was to a slice of pizza you
		found under the couch.
Homer:		It lost some points because it had a Hot Wheel on it.
Killday:	Good Lord, man, you're a critic!  You don't have to like
		everything, e.g., my latest review.  [reading]  We see
		John Deere has come out with this years line of roto-
		tillers.  Surprise, surprise, they're green.  I say it's
		time to time to send John Deere a Dear John.
Homer:		[laughing] Oh, that's classic.
Killday:	You don't have to patronize me.
Homer:		[stops laughing abruptly] OK.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% The review beat takes Homer to a dinner theater.

Actor:	Lord, thy daughters Gonoril, Regan and Cordelia
Krusty:	[as King Lear] What is this Merry Old England or Petticoat
	Junction?  [boos and hisses from the audience]
Krusty:	Hey, lighten up, it's a comedy!
Actor:	[whispers] No it's not
Krusty:	It's not?!
-- Improv at the Avon, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Cut to Homer with Lisa in the audience, reviewing the dinner.

Homer:	This pea soup is as weak as the acting and nowhere near as
	hammy.
Lisa:	Dad, that's so mean!
Homer:	The other critics told me to be mean and you should always
	give in to peer pressure.
Lisa:	But what if someone bad tells me to ...
Homer:	Always.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Back to the action on the stage ...

Whoa, this material stinks.  I'm going to have to punch it up on the 
fly!  Oh, I got one  How do you make a King Lear?  Put the Queen in a 
bikini!  [more boos and hisses]  Here's another one:  "Knock, knock."  
"Who's there?"  "Juliet."  "Juliet who?"  "Juli-Ate so much pasta e 
fagiolo Romeo doesn't want her anymore!"  [more boos]  Ooh.  Tough 
crowd.  They're booing Shakespeare!
-- Krusty, trying to improve on the Bard, "Guess Who's Coming to
   Criticize Dinner?"

% The next day's "Shopper" reveals Homer's scathing review, calling 
% Krusty the worst King Lear in four hundred years.
%
% The nasty trend in reviews continues at Luigi's, where Homer 
% disparages the lasagna.  The chef doesn't take it well; he attacks 
% Homer with a knife, slicing off a small piece of Homer's ear.
%
% Even Marge doesn't escape Homer's judgement.

Marge:	Who wants pork chops?!
Homer:	[carefully tasting the food] Sorry Marge, I'm afraid this
	gets my lowest rating ever.  Seven thumbs up.
Marge:	You always liked my pork chops.
Homer:	Marge, I'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves,
	Shake and Bake.
Marge:	You like Shake n' Bake.  You used to put it in your
	coffee.
Homer:	People change, Marge.  My palate has grown more
	sophisticated.
Marge:	Oh yeah, what's a palate?
Homer:	Oh ... it's a ... special time in a boys life when ... got
	to go!  [rushes out]
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Cut to Homer in Lisa's room reciting a review.

Homer:	Some come to the Legless Frog if you want to get sick and
	die and leave a big garlicky corpse.  P.S. Parking was
	ample.
Lisa:	Dad, you're being cruel for no reason!  What will people
	think?
Homer:	People will think what I tell them you think when you tell
	me what to tell them to think!
Lisa:	Not anymore!  I don't want to be partners with a man who
	thinks like that!  [stalks off]
Homer:	Nobody talks to me that way.  I'm Homer Simpson, the most
	powerful food critic in town, who will never get his
	comeuppance!  You hear me?  No comeuppance!
	[turns to the camera]
	We'll be right back.
-- Who are *you* talking to?  "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize
   Dinner?"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  13:43]
%
% Homer now attempts to write the review with Maggie and SLH.

Homer:	I don't need Lisa to write a good review.  [reads]  The
	food at the Gilded Truffle really ... What's a good word?
	[Maggie makes a sucking sound]
	Sucks!  That's great!  And the bread was really ... [looks
	at SLH] Come on, help me out here!
SLH:	Ruff!
Homer:	Rough?  I don't know, you've been pitching that all night.
SLH:	Chewy?
Homer:	Chewy!  That's inspired!
-- Inspiration is where you find it, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize
   Dinner?"

% Back at Springfield Shopper, the Editor reviews Homer's latest 
% review.

Editor:	Homer what gives with this review?  You say the salad
	tastes like bark and the potatoes were very [growls]. 
	This reads like it was written by a dog.
Homer:	Are you crazy?  A dog can't type.  [under his breath] 
	Unfortunately.
Editor:	Listen, you've got to shape up.  Next week is the Taste of
	Springfield festival.  You'll be reviewing every
	restaurant in town.  Remember, people have certain
	expectations about the LifeWays section.
Homer:	Really, like what?
Editor:	Oh, I don't know.  Astrology, "Brunhilda," vacation horror
	stories, articles about chronic fatigue syndrome.  You
	know, chick crap.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Meanwhile, Springfield's restaurateurs meet to plot their response 
% to Homer's reviews.

Luigi:		Homer, he's out of control.  He gave me a bad
		review.  So my friend put a horse head on the
		bed.  He ate the head and gave it a bad review! 
		True Story.
McAllister:	Argh, well I've had it with Homer.  His bad reviews
		are sinking our businesses.
Man:		They why did you put yours in the window?
McAllister:	Argh, it's covered up the 'D' from the health
		inspector.
Man:		Well I say we ban Homer from our restaurants.
Akira:		No, that would be impolite.  I say we kill him!
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Akira proposes that they kill Homer at the Taste of Springfield 
% festival.  After some hesitation, the group agrees.  A French chef 
% unveils what he thinks should be the instrument of Homer's demise:  
% An éclair.

Man:		Come on, you're going to kill him with a pastry? 
		I've seen this man eat a bowl of change!
Chef:		This éclair is over one million calories.  Twenty-five
		pounds of butter per square inch.  Covered with chocolate
		so dark that light cannot escape its surface.  [The other
		restaurateurs lunge for the savoury picture]  No, no, no! 
		This is just a picture.  But Homer Simpson will find the
		real thing both delicious and deadly.
Akira:		Ah, yes, Death by Chocolate.
Chef:		... and poison, I'll stick in some poison.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Homer arrives at the Taste of Springfield festival.

Marge:		Homey, my women's intuition acting up.  Something bad's
		going to happen if you go in there.
Homer:		Oh Marge, something bad usually happens to me when I go in
		anywhere.  [He steps in a puddle, gets hit by Frisbee,
		then is attacked by a bat]  A bat, now that's a new one.
-- Life's an adventure, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Homer has an awkward run-in with Lisa, who is covering the festival 
% for her school paper.  Elsewhere, the Frenchman sets up shop and 
% prepares to make the lethal desert.
%
% Akira and McAllister look on as Homer serves another bad review to 
% Luigi.

McAllister:	Lard ho!  'Tis a good sign; Homer's unfastened the
		top button on his pants.
Akira:		Uh no, he's been walking around like that since
		Thanksgiving.
McAllister:	I'm surprised he doesn't just give it up and go for
		sweatpants.
Akira:		He says the crotch wears out too fast.
McAllister:	Yar!  That's going to replace the whale in my
		nightmares
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% Bart overhears the two discuss their plans to knock off Homer, and 
% runs to tell Marge.

Bart:		... so if we don't find Dad this crazy French guy is going
		to kill him.
Marge:		Only your father could take a part time job at a small
		town paper and wind up the target of international
		assassins.
-- "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?"

% The family splits up in search of Homer.  The chef has put the 
% finishing touches on the éclair.  Flanders sees it, but the chef 
% shoos him away before Ned can turn himself into collateral damage.  
% ("A rude Frenchman, well I've never," the indignant Flanders says.)  
% Finally, Homer strolls up to the chef's booth.

Homer:	[eyes the killer éclair]  Ooh, sweet!
Lisa:	[runs up] Dad, no!  It's going to kill you
Homer:	Eh, I've had a good run.
Lisa:	Don't!  It's low-fat!
Homer:	Noooo!  [tosses éclair at a booth.  A large explosion
	ensues]
Wiggum:	That was close!  Thank God it landed in that smoking
	crater.
-- Yeah, those craters really come in handy, "Guess Who's Coming to
   Criticize Dinner?"

% The French chef tries to run off but is captured by the police.  He 
% manages to run off again as the cops debate what to have for lunch.  
% Meanwhile, Homer thanks Lisa for saving his life.

Homer:	Oh, Lisa, you saved me!  And after all the bad things I
	said about you.
Lisa:	What bad things?  Why?
Homer:	Oh, Lisa, the important thing is I didn't get my
	comeuppance, and I never will.
Lisa:	[notices the restaurateurs massing] Uh ... Dad?
Homer:	I know honey.  The important thing is ... run!
	[they make a run for the nearest exit]
	[fade to black and roll credits, just before Homer gets
	attacked by restaurant owners' mob]
	Oooh.  Finally getting my comeuppance!
-- One comeuppance, coming up, "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize
   Dinner?"
