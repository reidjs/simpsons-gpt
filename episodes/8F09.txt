    ... Phil Hartman voiced the stockbroker?

        during such shots.
    ... Smithers was so upset, he gave Homer change, thinking
        Homer was a beggar?  {thf}
    ... the stockbroker worked in a boiler room? {thf}
    ... Marge needed a calculator to multiply 100 by 52?
        Like she said, ``Not if I have to do heavy lifting or math.'' [7f12]
    ... the $100,000,000 offer was written in German Fraktur?

> Mixed reviews
===============================================================================

[JYANOWITZ@hamp.hampshire.edu]:  All in all, it just wasn't a great episode.

David Reid {dr}:  It seems I'm in the minority here, but my friends and I
thought that this episode was a CLASSIC!!!  Homer in the land of chocolate
had to have been the funniest 60 seconds of television in many years.

John Mastrangelo {jm}:  After watching this episode 5 times or so, I
think it is one of the best, better than Flaming Moe's.

Bryan Kelln {bk}:  I thought this episode was fast paced and does not
beat Flamin' Moe's for best episode of the year.  Best part of the
show? The Land of Chocolate sequence.

Lesli Thorn {lt}:  Its--well, its okay.  Not much of it was that funny.
I gave this episode no rating, no thumbs up OR down.  Just a ok.

John P. Connolly {jpc}:  The story line was missing something.  The ending
was missing something too.  I sat there bored through most of it.  I rate
it close to the bottom of the list.  I say thumbs down.

Lawrence A. Schwimmer {las}:  The surreal chocolate land sequence was
definitely the best.  Especially the dog.  That was the work of a
wonderfully deranged mind.

Andrew Tannenbaum {trb}:  I thought it was a cool episode.

J. D. Baldwin {jdb}:  By the standards of the Simpsons it was
`Mediocre-Plus', which of course means that by the standards of TV in
general it was brilliant.  They can't all be `Flaming Moe's' and `Itchy
and Scratchy and Marge'.

Ron Carter {rc}:  I liked the episode, Itchy and Scratchy had me rolling,
and those kooky Germans!  Just like `Hogan's Heroes'.

Yours Truly {rjc}:  This episode sort of grows on you.  Of course, we all
knew Burns was going to buy the plant back, it was just a question of how.
The laugh-on-the-floor award goes to the list of laid-off employees.  Good
thing a commercial break came right afterwards so I could regain my
composure.

All due to Dave Hall {dh}:

Moe's towel disappeared after he opened the bottle.

The pan with glowing water(?) dripping into it only appeared after Horst
spoke about talking to the safety inspector.

As Homer was talking to Marge, the moon can be clearly seen through the
bedroom window--which faces the front, but you can also see the moon
through the kitchen window (which faces the backyard) when Homer sat
down to do the puzzle.

Intro shot of Homer talking to the two Germans show one of them holding a
folder, yet later, this folder is nowhere to be seen.

You could see the chair legs under the desk, but not the feet of the two
Germans talking to Homer.

As Marge walking into the kitchen with her new hair-do, Maggie had a baby
bottle in front of her.  But after Marge put Snowball II on the floor, this
bottle is gone.  (A jug and glass disappeared as well.)

During Bart prank phone call, Barney's mug didn't have a handle (or rather,
he wasn't holding it by the handle?).

The fire hydrant and the "No Parking" sign(?) were missing from the front of
Moe's Tavern.

Burns parked his car on the wrong side of the street.

Although Burns office was used as a Day-care, He took a letter opener(?)
out from the desk.  (Note that the pig wasn't on the desk when he started
to clear it.)

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> German

>>> The title, ``Burns verkaufen der Kraftwerk''

The title is supposed to be German for ``Burns sells the power plant'',
but some verb conjugations and article declensions got mangled.  It should
be, ``Burns verkauft das Kraftwerk''.

Tilo Sloboda (sloboda@i41s12.ira.uka.de) adds, ``Otherwise it sounds like
a portion of text from a Taiwanese computer manual.''

>>> The meeting in the restaurant

Burns:    Der Sauerbraten schmeckt koestlich.
          [The Sauerbraten is excellent.]
Smithers: Oh, you never cease to amaze me, sir.
Burns:    Mein Kriecher sagte mir, dass ich bin nie aufhoere, zu erstaunen.
          [My lickspittle told me I / never cease to amaze him.]
Man 1:    Wir denken, wir haben ein sehr gutes Angebot.
          [We think we have a / very generous offer.]
Burns:    Du verspielst deine Zeit!
          [You are wasting your time.]

Smithers' sycophantic comments aside, Burns' German wasn't entirely
amazing.

(1) He mispronounced `koestlich' as `kustlich', and `Zeit' as `Seit'.
(2) His second sentence should have ended, ``dass ich nie aufhoere, ihn
    zu erstaunen.''  As it currently stands, it makes little sense.
(3) Perhaps his biggest blunder was saying ``Du verspielst deine Zeit''
    instead of ``Sie verspielen Ihre Zeit''.  (Or ``Ihr verspielt euere
    Zeit'' if the use of the familiar form was intended to be condescending.)

Nevertheless, it's impressive that Burns can speak German at all.

>>> Sycophantic German

Not even close.  Smithers should demand a full refund.

>> Why Germany?

Some people have wondered why the investors weren't Japanese.  First,
Japanese investors have already appeared, in [7f16].  And, as John
Mastrangelo {jm} pointed out, if the investors weren't German, Homer
couldn't have dreamed about the Land of Chocolate.  Remember, the
cardinal rule:  It has to be funny.

>> The new cars

Lawrence Alan Schwimmer {las} wonders how everyone was able to buy a
fabulous new car with only 5200 dollars.

John DeCarlo {jdc} figures, ``They only needed a 10% down payment, maybe
even 5%, right?  Of course none of them would be able to <keep> those cars
for long, which made me laugh even more.''

>> Bart's song

Andrew Tannenbaum {trb} identifies the song as Teddy Bear's Picnic,
a pretty popular children's song.

    Every teddy bear who's been good, is sure of a treat today.
    There's lots of marvelous things to eat and wonderful games to play.
    Beneath the trees where nobody sees,
    They'll hide and seek as long as they please.
    Today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic.

This is actually the second verse of the song, but the format of the final
line in the actual song is really: ``Cuz that's the way the teddy bears
have their picnic''.  In this verse, but using artistic license, Bart sang
the normal one (from the first and third verses).

>> Miscellaneous

The German businessmen had a giant suitcase of cash, yet they paid for
the plant by check.  So why carry the suitcase around at all?  And how
would counting the money in the suitcase tell them anything about their
checking account balance?  (I know, I know, because it was funny.)

Nectar is gathered by the workers, not drones.  Drones actually just
laze about doing nothing.  Sort of like Homer without the Duff beer.

Ron Carter {rc} points out that they were really playing lawn bowling, not
bocce ball.

On the toaster scene, Lesli Thorn {lt} asks, ``Why couldn't it have
exploded, or slightly charbroiled Homer?  The effect would have been
great.''  J. D. Baldwin {jdb} answers, ``It would also have forced Homer
to learn a lesson and not lumber through life just barely getting away
with incredibly idiotic stunts like this one.  See the dictionary entry
under `Homer' for further enlightenment.''

% Smithers washes the hair of Monty Burns, whose spirits are down.  Burns

%
% Homer tries to feed a tattered dollar bill into the vending machine,

% for $100 million.''  Homer asks Smithers for change for a dollar.
%
% At work, Homer takes a call from his stockbroker.

Broker: Your stock in the power plant just went up for the first time
        in ten years.
Homer:  I own stock?
Broker: Yes, all the employees got some in exchange for waiving certain
        Constitutional rights.
-- A fair exchange, ``Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk''

% Before the broker can talk business, ``The book says we have to make a
% little small talk before we get down to business.''  After some
% tremendously superficial conversation, the broker tells Homer his stock
% is now 25c a share, giving him $25.  Homer eagerly tells the broker to
% sell, then dreams of how he could spend the money...  Getting a haircut...
% Getting the car hot-waxed...  Buying a $25 hammer...
%
% Marge interrupts Bart's viewing of another Itchy and Scratchy cartoon

% poured into his mouth...  Wearing a personal rocket and skywriting
% the message, ``Eat my shorts''...
%
% Homer decides to celebrate his good fortune by ordering a bottle of
% Henry K. Duff's Private Reserves at Moe's.

For your information, I just made a cool $25 playing the market.

I may just quit my job at the power plant and become a full-time
stock... market guy.

Man 1: We are interested in buying the power plant.
       Do you think the owner will ever sell it?
Homer: Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than
       $100 million!
Man 2: 100 million?
Man 1: [opens a briefcase of cash, counts]  Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fuenf...

       Oh no, the Germans are coming after me.
Man 2: Please stop the `pretending you are scared' game, please.
Horst: Stop it!  Stop it!
Burns: [brief pause, then resumes]
       No!  They're so big and strong!
Man 2: Stop it.
Horst: Stop it, Mr. Burns.
Man 2: Please stop pretending you are scared of us, please, now.
Burns: Oh, protect me from the Germans!  The Germans...
Horst: Burns, STOP IT!
