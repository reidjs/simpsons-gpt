>> Funeral Attire

The family are dressed in black, down to the shoes.

Homer accessorizes his suit with a pink necktie.  (That free-thinking
anarchist.)

Marge wears a dress that comes up to the neck, along with a veil and
a red pocketbook.

Lisa wears a black version of her regular dress, except that the bottom
hem is straight rather than jagged.

Maggie is in a black baggie.

Bart is in a black suit, also with a pink tie, his hair still spikey
(not combed down).

===============================================================================
> Animation and continuity goofs
===============================================================================
In the half-hour show, Homer is an only child (with the half-exception of
Herbert Powell), and Marge has two sisters.  Neither has a brother named
Hubert.  (Like we really expected them to try to be consistent with the
shorts.  Duh...)

===============================================================================
> Assorted comments and observations
===============================================================================
Brian Howard {bh} gives the timing for this short as 1:40 whereas the
syndication package contains only 1:28 of animation.

Don't miss the ``Drugs and Guns'' sketch in the rest of the show.

% At the funeral home, the family have dour expressions, except for Bart,

O: Would the family care to view the loved one at this time?

% They head in.  Bart clasps his hands in wicked anticipation.

B: Oh, boy!  I've never seen a dead body before.
   I bet his skin'll be all green and clammy and stuff.
   It'll be just like a zombie movie, only real!
