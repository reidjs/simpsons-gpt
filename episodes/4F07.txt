> "TV Guide" Synopsis  {ol}
==============================================================================
   After a hurricane destroys the Flanders' house, the citizenry
   rebuilds it. But Ned publicly criticizes their workmanship, and the
   guilt from his outburst sends him to a mental hospital.

==============================================================================
> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Couch      :- The couch is missing, replaced by a Vend-A-Couch panel.
              Homer puts in a coin, then bangs the machine, only to get
              the couch dropped on him.

==============================================================================
> Did you notice...
==============================================================================
   ... the Del Monte logo on the creamed eels?
   ... Grandpa claims he was born in the nursing home?
   ... Apu's moustache sticking straight up when they pass the "electric
       room?"
   ... in the asylum were Ms. Botzkowski, John Swartzwelder (no, not
       David Crosby) and Jay Sherman (from "The Critic")?
   ... one of the signs being held up at the end said "Free John
       Swartzwelder"?

Dale G. Abersold:
   ... this was the first episode written by Steve Young?  (not the
       quarterback, natch)

Stephan Bonneville:
   ... only Lisa has a platform outside her window?
   ... Swartzwelder's and Ms. Botz's cell doors are open and unattended?
   ... Ned has a manger scene up despite the fact it is not Christmas?

James R. Curry:
   ... Lisa actually needs to look up the signs of a Hurricane?
   ... Marge drives a car through the intense winds?
   ... the box of "X-MAS Lights" in the cellar?
   ... OFF have a couch in the cellar?
   ... in the house the townspeople build, the ground floor is
       considerably better built than the upstairs floor?

Don Del Grande:
   ... in the "The Hurricane" takeoff of the opening, the left half of
       the word "Hurricane" appears first, just as the left half of
       "Simpsons" appears first in the opening (although that's because
       the right half is behind a cloud)?
   ... during the hurricane, the shutters on the front of the house
       don't move while the ones in back of the house do?
   ... Ned twitches his left eye twice - once after saying he's "fine"
       following the spanking, and again at the end of the episode?
   ... Maggie is gesturing how to turn the Rubik's Cube along with the
       others?
   ... the Leftorium is normally closed?  (Maude says "we'll open up the
       Leftorium")
   ... Ned's house must have been the most poorly-made one in the
       neighborhood, since no other house in the vicinity appeared to be
       even scratched?
   ... Lisa's barometer was marked "18-29-30-31"?
   ... the pressure dropped to below 28.5" below the hurricane hit?
   ... apparently, Kwik-E-Mart was the only store open?
   ... in close-up, you can't read "Butthole" on Todd's shirt, but in
       the next scene, you can?
   ... Ned didn't have anything bad to say about Maggie?  (If you don't
       count "your family's out of control" to Marge, that is)

Jason Hancock:
   ... the can of wadded beef resembles a Campbell's Soup can?
   ... the prison warden (from 9F20) and Dean Peterson (from Springfield
       University, 1F02) are at the execution?
   ... the church's TV has bent rabbit ears?
   ... the "I Love Southpaws" and "Left-Handers Rule" posters at the
       Leftorium?
   ... the "Kiss Me, I'm Left Handed" T-shirts at the Leftorium?
   ... this is the first speaking role for Ned's mother?  (His father
       spoke in 1F18.)

Tony Hill:
   ... Apu's rooftop garden is gone?
   ... the Flanderses haven't rebuilt the bomb shelter?
   ... a spindle on the admissions desk?
   ... Ned wore glasses as a child?
   ... even Maggie wears a "Sane" sticker?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the D'oh when the couch lands on Homer?
   ... Flanders' room in the mental hospital is 107?

Haynes Lee:
   ... TV Guide says this episode is postponed from an earlier date?
       (which pretty much speaks for the entire eighth season!)
   ... Hutz is the first one in the Kwik-E-Mart?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... Matt Groening leaves his name on this episode despite the
       appearance of Jay Sherman?
   ... Lisa has a meteorology station set up for no particular reason?
        [was I the only one to set up one as a kid too? --ed]
   ... OFF doesn't take Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II into the
       cellar with them?
   ... Ned puts on his glasses even though the right lens fell out?
   ... Ned swears twice in this episode?
   ... Homer doesn't bring his "Not Insane" certificate to the hospital?
   ... we finally hear the real closing song?

Donald Martin:
   ... Ned Flanders' response to Homer asking him if he hated
       fluorescent lights seems overdubbed?
         [if so, anybody knows what the original line was? --ed]

David Ney:
   ... OFF now have a cellar with an outside entrance?
   ... when Ned is dragged off, he screams, but does not kick?

Nathan Patrin:
   ... one person steals a left-handed Statue of Liberty from the
       Leftorium?

Benjamin J. Robinson:
   ... Ned's stream of "diddelys" right before he snaps includes the
       words "shoddily" and "hostility"?

Jean-Philippe Savard:
   ... Calmwood Hospital doesn't bother to repair the fence Ned drove
       through?

Liam J. Scanlan:
   ... this is the second hurricane that Springfieldians should know
       about? (It starts with a B)
   ... Ned's beatnik mother looks like Maude?

+  Lisa has never had such a big window platform.  {sb2}

*  An anemometer (wind gauge) against the side of a house is pretty much
   useless, since it can't measure winds coming from the "house side".
   {ddg}

*  Lisa's barometer is dropping far too fast to be working properly; had
   the pressure dropped one inch in a second, the winds should have been
   strong enough at that point to blow the entire town of Springfield
   through the air and drop it on Shelbyville.  {ddg}

+  In 4F01, there was a window on the side of the house; it's not there
   now.  {ddg}

*  Hurricanes don't suddenly spring up out of nowhere; there should have
   been plenty of warning that one was coming before Santa's Little
   Helper was blown away.  {ddg}

*  Despite what Kent Brockman claims, half of all hurricanes are given
   men's names now.  (There was a time that all hurricanes had women's
   names - the usual reason was "there's no such thing as a HIMicane".)
   {ddg}

+  Why is the Kwik-E-Mart Springfield's only source of emergency
   supplies?  What about the MonstroMart? (or that store Marge goes to
   in the unabridged opening we never see anymore).  {ol}

+  Brandine's hair is white in this episode; it's usually red.  {jh}

+  Why would Homer decline Ned's invitation now? In the past,
   (especially 2F11) he jumped at the chance to take advantage of the
   Flanders' better facilities.  {sb2}

=  The tape on Maggie's face disappears once Marge and Lisa arrive from
   the store.  {jh}

+  Since when did OFF go into the cellar when Grampa visits?  (cf. 3F06,
   others)  {jh}

+  Why didn't OFF stay in their cellar when the comet was about to hit?
   {dn}

*  There's no way even a hurricane could tear the roof off of a concrete
   prison.  {np}

+  The Olmec Head is in the basement, not the cellar.  {ol}

*  The Rubik's Cube has two sides with white centers, which is
   impossible as each side's center must always be a different color
   from the other sides' centers.  {ddg}

=  For that matter, the individual pieces change colors while Marge is
   turning them.  {ddg}

*  Why would people choose to loot the Leftorium over other more
   practical stores?  (What about the Monstro Mart?)  {sb2}

*  Having lived in a church for three years, I can tell you that
   moonlight would not shine through stained glass.  {sf}

=  Ned's torn up clothes are restored back to normal in the Flanderses
   next day spent at the rescue center.  {ol}

=  Dr. Foster pulled the second straitjacket and the projector from thin
   air.  {ol}

+  Flanders is referred to as "never being aggressive towards anyone in
   his life", but in 1F14, Ned dreams of killing people with a sniper's
   rifle.  {np}

+  Homer did make Ned crack in [1F14] by whistling through his nose at
   church.  {hl}
     
+  If Dr. Foster is correct about Ned's "Diddilies" as a means of
   suppressing rage, he must get angry at everything in life.  For
   instance, in 3F22 "Summer of 4 ft. 2," Ned literally writes down
   "diddily" on a note taped onto the front door of the beach house.
   {ol}

+  Dr. Foster asks Ned if there's someone who makes him angry, which
   leads to Homer. Yet later, Ned denies deing angry towards anyone.

*  If Dr. Foster was asleep at night when he rushes in to treat Ned
   Flanders, why is the family awake at that time of night?  {ol}

=  I hope Homer has his "Not Insane" certificate on him, because he
   loses his "SANE" badge.  {bjr}

+  Ned's hating his parents is inconsistent with previous episodes,
   where he's afraid to unplug the phone because his mother might call,
   and has Grandma Flanders staying at his house.  {sf}

*  Why does Ned need a ride in Marge's car when he has his own car? (It
   wasn't destroyed in the hurricane, otherwise, he couldn't have drove
   himself to the Mental Hospital)  {ol}

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  A fun portrait of our favorite Christian optimist
   (with remarkable continuity).  Unlike some episodes, the in-jokes
   were not obvious and tacked-on.  The last act was a little slow, but
   overall, a worthy effort.  (A-)

Jared Betnar:  I really enjoyed this episode. I found myself laughing
   out loud quite a few times. "Ralph the Pumpkin" was great, along with
   the comment Lisa makes that the Hall of Records "was mysteriously
   blown away", and just about anything with Flanders' rebuilt house was
   hilarious. And who wouldn't love "Evil Little Neddy"? And the writers
   even managed to fight in an interesting story that mostly revolved
   around a secondary character. But the ending was kind of
   disappointing, I felt like there should have been more.  (B+)

Stephane Bonneville:  This episode was great! The hilarious return of
   Ned's beatnik parents and flashbacks of little Ned were what made
   this show great, but seeing the true idiocy of many of the
   Springfieldians also had me laughing through most of this episode.
   The only disappointment was the ending, which I felt fell a bit flat.
   (A)

James R. Curry:  Well, this season really is to date much better than
   last years.  It was good to see Jay Sherman re-appear breifly, I miss
   "The Critic".  Ned's background?  Er, I'm not sure.  He HAS expressed
   anger before, and he doesn't just break into diddily-doodily speak
   when he's upset.  Oh well, the first half was great, and the second
   half was quite good.  (B)

Steve Frayne:  This episode had a great setup in Ned losing everything,
   but had a complete and total plot shift after he enters the mental
   hospital. It's almost like they forgot that he lacked a house, and he
   had no business. I wish those original problems had been solved.
   Nevertheless, I'm betting the Flanders house is back in action next
   week.  This wasn't a tremendously funny episode, but it had a few
   moments like "Hurricane Chow" and the "Load-bearing poster".  Without
   a doubt, the best part was when Homer was able to cure Flander's
   psychological problem better than the professionals. First two acts
   were great, but including the last one it gets a C-.

Don Del Grande:  This one was a roller coaster: the hurricane (good),
   Ned's reaction (not so good), the new house and Ned's ranting (good),
   Ned and Homer in the asylum (not so good).  Ned would probably say it
   was "fine" - after winking his left eye.  (B)

Jason Hancock:  OK, this episode had its moments.  But it had too many
   things that just didn't make sense to me, like the bowling alley
   ending up on top of a mountain and Ned being spanked for eight months
   straight.  I can't say I hated this one, but I didn't think it was
   one of their best efforts either.  (C)

Tony Hill:  It's a waste of time to make an episode centering on a minor
   character. This format necessitates too many Simpson-less scenes.
   Also, the Ned-talk resulting from therapy is inconsistent with "Lisa
   the Vegetarian" in which the clan talked like Ned. The slam at my
   alma mater didn't help.  (C-)

Joe Klemm:  This is the best episode after two weeks of bombs. I loved
   the hurricane jokes. Ralph as a pumpkin is another great scene
   featuring him. Let the nuttiness continue.  (A)

Ondre Lombard:  Overall, a mediocre installment that had a few exciting
   moments and good jokes.  Ned's breakdown made for the only classic
   moment in this story, and act 3 pretty much slammed into a wall of
   mediocrity, saved only by Homer's "intercourse" line.  Not too much
   of Our Favorite Family, but of what we saw, no one was grossly out of
   character (especially Marge and Lisa, who have been written really
   badly this year).  (B-)

David Ney:  I really thought this was a good episdode.  Again, not up to
   4th, 5th, and 6th season standards, but that's what I've come to
   expect.  For an 8th season episode, it was very good.  I loved some
   of the gags, including the convict hitting th power lines, the flying
   bowling alley, and Ned's secret destructive side of his childhood.  I
   was happy to see Ned's cool beatnick parents once again.  (B+)

Nathan Patrin:  Oh man. I waited two weeks for this? The prospect of Ned
   Flanders going mental seemed way more laden with potential than what
   we wound up with. The freaked-out rebuilt Flanders house was pretty
   cool (toilet in the kitchen!), and the Jay Sherman cameo was
   startling enough to be amusing, but... man, did that ever feel
   hodgepodge. Ned Having a Major Crisis (see: When Flanders Failed)
   rarely winds up that humorous, which is why Hurricane Neddy... well,
   blew.  (D+)

Werner Peeters:  Everything before and during the storm was hilarious
   (the crowd at the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer going out when their house is in
   the centre of the tornado, etc.) The joke about the re-built house
   lasted a bit too long, but when Flanders ended up in the mental
   hospital we've had about the best of the episode. The third act, Ned
   talking about his childhood, was so way-off that it kinda spoiled the
   storyline; the "mental jump" from the house wreckage to Ned's unhappy
   youth was too far-fetched.  (C+)

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  A fine premise, but the execution is only
   two-thirds of the way there. In particular, the lack of change in
   Ned's demeanor at the show's end makes the third act seem emotionally
   flat.  Also, the recent trend toward finding surprising things about
   the secondary characters is carried too far here.  Good sequences in
   the third first two acts (like the house tour, and Ned's meltdown)
   raise this to the B- level.

Andrius Schmid:  Somewhat of a disappointment.  On one hand, it was a
   without a doubt a Ned Flanders showcase, and therefore wonderful.
   However, I expected a God vs. Job parody and instead got an episode
   who's first half seemed to be an exaggerated lead-in for a few
   flash-back sequences.   Except for a great ranting sequence by Ned,
   this episode was flat.  (B-)

Nelson Seggley:  This episode was curiously unsatisfying. It had the
   sophistication and cross-references that I love, but there was hardly
   a thing I laughed at. Coming off three great episodes, I had hoped
   this would be funny AND intelligent. It was interesting to watch
   purely for character reasons. But so much dead laughing time was
   deplorable. Several obvious gags fell flat. I wish the writers had
   tried harder.  (C)

Vishal Sharma: In all honesty, I have to say this is the second great
   episode of Season 8, proving that the ol' Simpsons magic hasn't been
   lost. The hurricane bit was bizarre, and a bit offbeat, but Ned
   Flanders breaking down has been long over-due and this episode
   handled it exceptionally well. Overall, a nicely animated, extremely
   entertaining and quite touching Simpsons episode. One of the most
   memorable moments of this episode has to be the Jon Lovitz cameo in
   the mental hospital. That alone had me laughing all through the
   following night and day...  (A)

Marge Starbrod-Simpson:  Not as good as last week's, but okay. The couch
   gag was funny, and there were plenty of good jokes. However,
   something was lacking in the storyline, and the ep went way too fast.
   Act III could've been better.  (B-)

Yours Truly:  Some good lines here and there, but the episode was slowed
   down by Ned's "misery", to which we were supposed to feel sad, and
   his "behavior", which we were supposed to believe. Both fell flat to
   me. Of course, mangling his character like this didn't help. To me,
   it looked like an apology for all the stabs taken to religion. ("Look,
   it had nothing to do with Christianity all along!") All in all, a
   sour aftertaste.  (C)

>> When Hurricanes Attack

Benjamin Jay Robinson delivers some relevant observations on hurricanes:

   Nowadays, thanks to sophisticated tracking methods, hurricane- prone
   areas have at least one day's warning before a storm strike, and
   often closer to three.  These giant storms have been known to make
   last-minute shifts in direction, but the chances of getting caught
   unaware are very slim.

   Hurricanes are named in alphabetical order.  That is, "Amos" would
   occur before "Stella".  (By the way, they've been alternating boy and
   girl names since 1979 or so.)  A hurricane Barbara would most likely
   occur early in the season.  Ironically, the United States' real
   hurricane season ended about a month before this episode aired.

   The basement is not the best place to ride out a hurricane.  Most
   storm fatalities result from flooding, not high winds.  Hiding in the
   cellar, Our Favorite Family was actually in danger of drowning.
   Flanders, on the other hand, offers some good advice -- bring loose
   objects indoors, before the wind turns them into makeshift missiles.

   A small tornado picked up Homer.  This makes sense, actually, since
   hurricanes spawn tornadoes.  Flanders' localized damage looks like
   the result of a tornado hit.

   The "Where is Springfield" crowd might be interested to know that, in
   the United States, hurricanes are most likely to make landfall on the
   East Coast (especially between Florida and North Carolina). The Gulf
   Coast (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida again) is
   also frequently hit.  Also, there is a Springfield, Florida.  It's in
   the panhandle, near Pensacola, and may be vulnerable to a hurricane
   passing through the Gulf of Mexico.

Aaron Varhola:  "Lisa" is in the name lineup for Atlantic hurricanes for
   1998. Lisa has not been used in the Atlantic; there was a weak
   tropical cyclone named Lisa this past fall that hit the Phillipines
   and China, I think.


>> Live forever... as a hurricane

Tom Restivo forwards us this Reuter article:

   MIAMI, May 26 (Reuter) - Exhausted forecasters at the National
   Hurricane Centre wondered whether they would use up their
   alphabetized list of storm names in 1995, as 19 tropical storms and
   hurricanes churned through the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.

   If they had run out of the list of 21 names -- the letters Q, U, X, Y
   and Z are not used -- forecasters would have had to use for the first
   time a backup plan of naming storms for the letters of the Greek
   alphabet.

   The season went further into the alphabet than any other, but it
   slowed down from its nonstop pace in July, August and September.
   Hurricane Tanya, which faded November 1 without making landfall,
   would be the last of the season, leaving the names Van and Wendy the
   only two unclaimed.

   This year, forecasters hope they will not run that far into this
   list: Arthur, Bertha, Cesar, Dolly, Edouard, Fran, Gustav, Hortense,
   Isidore, Josephine, Kyle, Lili, Marco, Nana, Omar, Paloma, Rene,
   Sally, Teddy, Vicky and Wilfred.

   Hurricanes in the West Indies have had informal names for several
   hundred years, as many of the worst were named after the saint's day
   on which the hurricane occurred. For example, Hurricane Santa Ana
   struck Puerto Rico with exceptional violence July 26, 1985.

   The United States adopted its first organised storm naming system in
   1950, for three years naming storms after the phonetic alphabet --
   Abel, Baker, Charlie, etc. In 1953, the U.S. Weather Service began
   using women's names for storms.

   Men's names were added to the list for the Atlantic, Caribbean and
   Gulf of Mexico for the first time in 1979. Forecasters try to use
   short, easily remembered names that reflect the culture of the places
   hurricanes affect.

   The U.S. National Weather Service's National Hurricane Centre assigns
   a name to a storm when sustained winds reach tropical storm strength
   of 39 mph (63 kph). The centre keeps six annual lists of names, used
   in turn, but retires the name of the biggest storms to minimise
   confusion later.

   For example, there will never be another Hurricane Andrew.

   Names for the lists are selected from library sources and agreed upon
   by nations involved during international meetings of the World
   Meteorological Organisation.

   The Atlantic Hurricane Season lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30.

Tom's addendum:

   Hurricanes for the Atlantic Basin are retired by the Region 4
   Hurricane Committe of WMO.

   Barbara would probably join Betsy (1965), Beulah (1967), and Bob
   (1991) in the "retired" name set. However, in the "Where is
   Springfield?" saga, Homer mentioned "back east", thus causing the
   focus of Springfield's location to be near the Pacific.

   Have they retired names for Pacific Hurricanes?

>> Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse

James Fraleigh:  In the opening act, Homer is being blown around in his
   hammock in a manner very similar to the way the above bridge was
   twisting before its collpase. The bridge was a suspension-style span
   constructed across a river valley (in Washington State?) that
   featured powerful and frequent wind gusts. These were not taken fully
   into account by the engineers who designed the bridge, though. The
   winds apparently caused the bridge to vibrate and eventually twist
   along its long axis. The way Homer was going (head one way, feet the
   other) was how the ENTIRE bridge was warping. Eventually the bridge
   shredded itself and collapsed.

   [nicknamed "Galloping Gertie", this 2800-feet-long bridge was the
   longest and most expensive suspended bridge to ever collapse --ed]


>> The latest public show

Ondre Lombard:  When the convict is about to be executed during the
   thunderstorm, I noticed there were people witnessing the impending
   execution.  It reminded me of a show on Oprah that I never saw, but
   asked people if victims of crime would want to see the criminal be
   executed.  Call it far-fetched, but this seemed like a slight
   reference to this.

   [Actually, Phil Donahue once wanted to broadcast an execution. Of
   course, no judge would be as silly to grant him this right --ed]


>> Twist your head 180 degrees clockwise

Joe Klemm:  Rubik's Cube is a popular game in the 80's. The object was
   to make it so the cube will have six areas in which the nine cubes in
   each area is the same color. The fad spun off some other projects
   including a game in which you try to make a pattern a la Rubik's cube
   and a cartoon made by Ruby-Spears.


>> But it goes with my Marilyn Manson jacket!

Nathan Patrin:  The Butthole Surfers: Rod's second-hand shirt features
   the name of the most whacked-out rock group to ever come from Texas.
   Led by Gibby Haynes, the Butthole Surfers have been around more or
   less since 1982 or so and have been on Alternative Tentacles and SST
   records before being signed to the majors, having an album produced
   by Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones entitled "Independent Worm Saloon"
   and having a huge college radio hit with the Beck-ish "Pepper" from
   their "Electric Larryland" album. They sound a lot like what would
   happen if Captain Beefheart and Jello Biafra started a bar band. Not
   exactly Flanders material...

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  Butthole Surfers were an alternative band back
   when "alternative" was another term for "unheard of".  As their name
   suggests, they're light years away from being a Flanders-friendly
   type of band.


>> That's diddily outrageous!

Some comments about Ned's "explained" behavior:

Sean Murdock:  To further complicate the problems created by "Hurricane
   Neddy", if you saw tonight's repeat ("Dead Putting Society"), you can
   see a Ned Flanders who is entirely capable of expressing not only
   anger ("You jackaninny!!") but other "lesser" emotions such as
   pettiness ("look, SIMP-son...") and competitiveness ("Mercy is for
   the weak, Todd!"). Although this isn't "typical Ned" behavior, it
   seems logical that even a good, normal, *non-scientifically-
   programmed* adult would react the way he did to Homer's goading. (If
   you want to *really* nitpick, this ep also shows Ned engaging in a
   bet -- this from a man who wouldn't buy insurance because he felt it
   was a form of gambling.) Now, however, we are asked to believe that
   Ned is merely a robitically "nice" person until he finally erupts --
   kinda shaves away some of the dimension of the character, doesn't it?
   I mean, it's like concentrating on nothing but Homer's stupidity, and
   discarding the minor fact that underneath it all, he loves his
   family. These characters are *already* two-dimensional; must they be
   made *one*-dimensional??

Benjamin J. Robinson:  Lately, there has been a controversial trend in
   focusing on secondary characters, and digging surprising skeletons
   out of their closets.  In the past, I have not had a problem with
   this, but after watching "Hurricane Neddy," I can understand the
   others' objections.  Ned Flanders isn't like Troy McClure or Kirk Van
   Houten, whom we previously knew little about.  He's popped up quite a
   bit in Homer's life, and it doesn't seem fair to so radically
   reinterpret his character.  I can accept Ned's repressing a store of
   anger, but to make him a walking time bomb is carrying things too
   far.

Ondre Lombard:  I am not all that pleased with these controversial
   trends of giving pasts to secondary characters.  Lately, this series
   is a lot less like The Simpsons and more like "The Simpsons help us
   learn something knew about a character you couldn't care less about."

   Throughout most of the season, all of this has merely resulted in
   either underuse of characters like Maggie and Bart, or poor
   characterization on characters like Marge and Lisa.  Marge for the
   most part has been nothing but a nag and Lisa seems to be like some
   type of boring nerd who is allergic to things we never saw her
   allergic _to_.  And all this just so we can deal with secondary
   characters.  IMO, I think the writers haven't a clue how to handle
   the main characters we care about so they've decided to write stories
   about the other characters who, even if they lapse out of character,
   we won't be flabbergasted by the outcome.

   I am scared to death that the 8th season will just turn into the
   "Lets Change Characters" year, because that's just the direction
   Hurricane Neddy sets the show in.  Next thing you know we'll see
   Comic Book Guy's past as a parttime Superhero busting Colombian drug
   lords.


>> Those Immortal Threads

   - Where is Springfield?

Don Del Grande:  It's somewhere where a hurricane can hit, which pretty
   much rules out most of the western USA (except for the California
   coast from Los Angeles south).

Gregg Ulrich:  Having lived on both the East and West coast, I've never
   seen Mallowmars (my favourite cookie BTW) on the West coast.  I
   always get my Mom to send me some ;-).


>> Loose Ends

   - Cultural winds

Don Del Grande:  For people in Australia, a "hurricane" is what North
   Americans call a typhoon/tropical cyclone.  (For that matter,
   pressure of 29 inches is about 737 mm of mercury.)
      [or 98.2 kPa --ed]

   - Head over heels

Steve Frayne:  Lisa could have been killed by being picked up by the
   head.  [How long till someone sues the show for this? --ed]

   - No gambling and no debts make Ned a dull boy

Steve Frayne:  The Flanderses must own the home outright, because a
   mortgagee would require homowners' insurance.

   - Aloha Oe

Steve Frayne:  "Aloha Oe" is a traditional Hawaiian song.  It was
   supposedly written by Queen Liliokelani.

   - Boom-da-boom

Don Del Grande:  Gene Krupa is probably best known as being the drummer
   in the Benny Goodman Quartet.  (Okay, who asked "Who's Benny
   Goodman"?)

   Ned: Was that, uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?
Wiggum: Uh, Ned, you ever try lugging a toilet up a flight of stairs?
-- Toilets and Refrigerators, together at last, "Hurricane Neddy"

% Rod and Todd's room were designed by Bart and Lisa, replete with a
% carpet that doesn't completely cover the floor, a crack in a wall, a
% slanted door frame and a "Krusty the Clown" poster.

 Rod: [taking down poster] I don't like this clown!
Bart: Ah, I wouldn't take it down if I were you.  It's a load-bearing
      poster.
       [a crack ripples through the upper wall and up to the ceiling]
-- "Hurricane Neddy"

% Homer, Apu and Ned walk alongside the uneven walls and five to six
% sided doorways.  Static makes Ned's hair stand up and his moustache
% hair stick out. The static is coming from the room filled with
% electricity.

Apu: This is the room with electricity.  But it has too much
     electricity.  So, I don't know, you might want to wear a hat.
Ned: Uh-huh.  [walks further down the hallway]
     Floor feels a little gritty here.
Moe: Yeah we ran out of floorboards there, so we painted the dirt.
     Pretty clever!
-- Fallback plans from the "Half-Assed Approach to House Erection,"
      "Hurricane Neddy"

% The hallway starts to become extremely narrow and small.

   Ned: Oh, something is definitely wrong with this hallway.
         [opens a 4-inch-tall door]
Barney: Come on in!  It's your master bedroom!
         [Ned shuts the dollhouse-sized door]
        Ow!  My nose!
   Ned: Well, I've seen about enough.
-- "Hurricane Neddy"

% Outside, Homer concludes the tour: "So, Flanders, what do you think of
% the house that _love_ built?"  He pats the front door, which falls
% inside the house, causing the second story to cave in.  Finally, the
% top story collapses, and the house is back to where it started from.
% "Aw shoot!" is his response, scratching his head to find out what went
% wrong.
%
% Ned walks away from the demolished "house" and begins to buff his
% glasses.  The right lens falls out, and Ned lets out a groan and puts
% on his glasses.

   Ned: Calm down, Neddly diddily diddily diddily, doodily.  They did
        their best shodaiddily iddily iddily diddily diddily.  Gotta be
        nice, hostidididildilidilly ah HELL diddily ding dong crap!
        Can't you morons do anything RIGHT!?
         [shocked gasps]
 Marge: Ned!  We meant well, and everyone here tried their best.
   Ned: Well my family and I can't live in good intentions, Marge!  Oh,
        your family's out of control, but we can't blame you, because
        you have gooooooooood intentions!
  Bart: Hey!  Back off, man!
   Ned: Ooh okay, duuuuude!  I wouldn't want you to have a cow, maaaan!
        Here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years:
        "Hey, Buddy, got a quarter?"
         [everyone gasps]
  Bart: I am shocked and appalled.
  Lisa: Mr. Flanders, with all due respect, Bart didn't do anything.
   Ned: Do I hear the sound of butting in?  It's gotta be little Lisa
        Simpson! Springfield's answer to a question NO ONE ASKED!
         [Wiggum laughs]
        What do we have here?  The long, flabby arm of the law!  The
        last case you got to the bottom of was a case of mallowmars!!
Krusty: [writing it down] Mallowmars, oh that's going in the act!
   Ned: Oh, yeah.  The clown, the only one of you buffoons who _doesn't_
        make me laugh!  [to Lenny]  And as for you, I don't know you but
        I'm sure you're a jerk!
 Lenny: Hey, I've only been here a few minutes!  What's going on?
   Ned: [to Moe] You ugly, hate-filled man!
   Moe: Hey, hey, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I... um, what was
        the third thing you said?
         [everyone backs away as Ned marches after Homer lastly]
   Ned: Homer, you are the worst human being I have ever met.
 Homer: Hey, I got off pretty easy.
-- "Hurricane Neddy"

% After concluding his nervous breakdown, Ned walks away in front of the
% shocked crowd, gets into his car and drives away.  Once far enough
% from all this, he turns on the radio, calmly humming to Aloha Oe.
% Reaching his destination, he signals right, and drives through the
% gates of the Calmwood Mental Hospital.

% [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:42]

  Ned: I just attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to
       help me.  I'd like to commit myself.
Nurse: Very well.  Shall I show you to your room, or would you prefer to
       be dragged off kicking and screaming?
  Ned: Ooh, kicking and screaming, please.
Nurse: As you wish.
        [two men in white grab hold of him and drag him away]
  Ned: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
-- "Hurricane Neddy"

% A nurse stops by a padded cell, and is shocked to see Ned's name on
% the door.  She quickly makes a phone call.

 Dr. Foster: Yes, Dr. Foster here.  ...  Ned Flanders?  You're sure?
             ...  No, no, no, I'll come right over.  And may God have
             mercy on us all.
              [hangs up]
             Darling, there's an emergency at the hospital, uh, where
             are my shoes?
Mrs. Foster: [sleepily] I think they're in the den.
 Dr. Foster: The den?  May God have mercy on us all.
-- "Hurricane Neddy"

% Dr. Foster visits Ned in his room.

Dr. Foster: Well, how are you feeling this evening?
       Ned: Uh, actually, I'm a little chilly.  Can I have another strait
            jacket?
-- "Hurricane Neddy"

% Ned recognizes Dr. Foster, who treated him thirty years ago.  However,
% he does not remember the darkest moments of that era.  Dr. Foster
% turns out the light and sets up a projector.  The Juvenile Aggression
% Study (sponsored by Swanson's TV Dinners) depicts Ned as he really
% was: a mischeivous, destructive troublemaker who insults his fellow
% playmates in preschool and hassles them.

Little Ned: [barging in]  Whee!  I'm Dick Tracy!  [hitting the other
            kids]  Bang!  Take that Pruneface!  Now I'm Pruneface, take
            that Dick Tracy!  Now I'm Prune Tracy, take that Dick...
Dr. Foster: Hey!  Stop it at once!
-- "Hurricane Neddy"

% Dr. Foster narrates how Ned's beatnik parents met with Dr. Foster
% about their son.  At their meeting, Neddy was smashing up Foster's
% diplomas.

Get down from that bookshelf, please. Most of those books haven't been
discredited yet!
-- Dr. Foster, "Hurricane Neddy"

Dr. Foster: Would you please tell your son to stop?
 Ned's Dad: We can't do it, man!  That's discipline!  That's like
            tellin' Gene Krupa not to go [starts banging on the desk]
            "boom boom bam bam bam, boom boom bam bam bam, boom boom
            boom bam ba ba ba ba, da boo boo *tss!*"
-- "Hurricane Neddy"

 Ned's Dad: We don't believe in rules, like, we gave them up when we
            started livin' like freaky beatniks!
Dr. Foster: You don't believe in rules, yet you want to control Ned's
            anger.
 Ned's Mom: Yeah.  You gotta help us, Doc.  We've tried nothin' and
            we're all out of ideas.
-- Oh the pain and suffering from doing nothing, "Hurricane Neddy"

% Dr. Foster decided to put Ned on the "University of Minnesota
% Spankological Protocol", which is nothing less than straight spanking
% for eight months in line.  As time passes, Dr. Foster's attire changes
% to suit the current occasion and season -- while still spanking Little
% Ned.  He changes into: a sweater (reading while spanking) during the
% Autumn, a Santa Suit during the Winter, a sportsshirt and party hat
% for Ned's birthday (Little Ned opens a birthday present), a summer
% shirt and shorts during the Summer, and finally back into his coat.
%
% At the end, the treatment worked too well, making Ned unable to
% express anger by flooding it under waves of "nonsensical jabbering."
% Dr. Foster decides to delve into the heart of the problem, requiring
% someone who can upset Ned.  Of course, Homer is called.

Homer: Yello?  ...  Yes?  ...  Mental hospital?  ...  Well I don't know
       any Ned Flanders.
Marge: The man who lived next door until his house blew down?
Homer: Oh, him!
-- How soon we forget, "Hurricane Neddy"

% The family, wearing "Sane" tags, visits Ned at the mental hospital.

You folks are free to roam the grounds.  Uh, just remember, one of our
patients is a cannibal.  Try to guess which one!  I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.
-- What do we win if we get eaten?, "Hurricane Neddy"

% The family tours the mental hospital, waking by cells of Lucille
% Botzcowski, a paranoiac patient, and a well-known face.

Jay Sherman: [to Doctor] It stinks!  It stinks!  It stinks!     
     Doctor: Yes, Mr. Sherman.  Everything stinks.
-- One too many Pauly Shore movies for one man to take,
      "Hurricane Neddy"

% Dr. Foster leaves Ned in a booth by himself, the other reserved for
% someone needed to be so irritating that Ned will not be able to
% repress his anger. Homer is obnoxiously blowing a bubble of bubble gum
% in Dr. Foster's face. "Homer, can you be that annoying?"  The bubble
% explodes and gum is all over Foster's face, proving he *can* be.
%
% Dr. Foster, joined by another doctor, sit behind a two-way mirror,
% observing Homer's interaction with Ned.  The sliding partition reveals
% Homer to Ned. Homer emotionlessly says what is written in his speech
% cards.

 Homer: Ned Flanders, I mock your value system.  You also appear foolish
        to the eyes of others.
   Ned: Well howdy, Homer!  [partition slides up]  Ooh, thanks for
        dropping by!
Foster: Hmm.  He's not responding.  [into microphone] Proceed to level 2
        antagonism.
         [slides down partition]
 Homer: Past instances in which I professed to like you were fraudulent.
   Ned: Oh, well, I'll just have to try harder.  Heh heh.  [partition
        slides up]  Ooh!  Thanks for dropping by!
Foster: Ah, he's still repressing.  [into microphone] Maximum hostility
        factor.
         [slide down partition]
 Homer: I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other.
        Now _that's_ psychiatry!  Eh?  Eh?
-- Freud would be proud, "Hurricane Neddy"

% Ned thinks it's a joke, and Homer throws in the towel.

 Homer: [directly towards mirror]  Aw that's it, you just can't insult
        this guy.  You call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning
        moronly.
   Ned: [to mirror]  Hi, neighbor!
 Homer: You know what your problem is, Flanders?  You're afraid to be
        human.
   Ned: Ho ho, now why would I be afraid of that?
 Homer: Because humans are obnoxious, sometimes.  Humans _hate_ things.
   Ned: Well, maybe a few of them do... back East.
Foster: I can't find what Homer's saying.  Did you write that?
Doctor: Um, did you like it?
-- At least this is more effective, "Hurricane Neddy"

Homer: Come on, Flanders, there's gotta be _something_ you hate.  What
       about mosquito bites?
  Ned: Mmm mmm!  Sure are fun to scratch!  Mmm!  Satisfying!
Homer: What about, uhhhhh, florescent lights?
  Ned: Oooh, they hum like angels!  You're never lonely if you've got a
       florescent light!
-- Oh, I give up, "Hurricane Neddy"

% Homer is about to give up, but Ned admits he doesn't like
% _everything_.

   Ned: I don't like the service at the post office.  You know, it's all
        "rush rush!  get'cha in, get'cha out!"  Then they've got those
        machines in the lobby, they're even faster, no help there. You
        might even say, I _hate_ the post office.
        That, and my parents.  Lousy beatniks.
        [sudden breakthrough sound] Hey!  That felt good.
Foster: He just said he hates his parents!  Do you know what that means?
Doctor: Um, what do you think?
Foster: It means he's cured.
Doctor: That's what I said.
-- The Nick Riviera method works again, "Hurricane Neddy"

% Ned's released from the hospital in front of a cheering crowd.

   Ned: Thanks, everyone!  I'm all better now.  No more storing up the
        anger till I explode.  If any of you does something I don't
        like, yo-ou're gonna hear about it!
         [crowd cheers]
Foster: Yes, that's very healthy, Ned.
   Ned: [omnious]  And if you really tick me off, I'm gonna run you down
        with my car.
         [clapping dies down dramatically and everyone looks worried]
 Homer: Heh heh!  Ned, you so craz-ay!
         [Ned winks]
-- You're not just whistling Dixie, Homer, "Hurricane Neddy"
