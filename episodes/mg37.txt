`Yendor' is Rodney spelled backwards.  Why?

> Quotes and scene summary
===============================================================================
% B = Bart, L = Lisa
%
% Bart, Lisa and Maggie walk down the street.  Bart holds Maggie's hand,
% but that doesn't help her keep her balance.  Lisa sings happily.

L: We're going to a movie!  We're going to a movie!

% Bart doesn't share her enthusiasm.

B: Oh, grow up.
L: I'm glad we're seeing the Happy Little Elves' Return.  Aren't you, Bart?
B: Oh, man, you're so normal.
L: Who's your favorite Happy Little Elf, Bart?  Yendor, Bubbles, or Doofy?
B: I can't stand those stupid elves.
L: Gee, Bart, you're just like Gloomy, the self-hating elf.
B: Will you shut up about those damn elves!
L: [aside to Maggie]  He <looks> like Gloomy, too.

% They reach the theater.  Lisa and Maggie stand in front of a Happy Little
% Elves poster.

L: [enjoying the poster] Aww....
B: [o.s.] Oh, boy!

% Pan over to Bart admiring a Revenge of the Space Mutants movie.

L: Oh, no, Bart.
B: Yeah, man!  Space Mutants!
L: Come on, Bart, that's <way> too scary.

% Bart approaches the ticket window.

B: Three childs [sic] for Space Mutants, sir.
   [to Lisa]  Someday, you'll thank me for this.

% Bart pays for the tickets.
%
% Bart sits between the girls in the nearly empty theater.  (The only other
% person is asleep.)  Bart has a soda and a tub of popcorn in his lap.  Lisa
% folds her hands apprehensively.  Maggie just sucks away.  Bart's mouth is
% full of popcorn.

B: Now listen up.  We're gonna be seeing some pretty heavy stuff in this movie.
   Death rays, flying saucers, giant eyeballs...

% Maggie sucks with a worried expression.  Lisa swallows hard.

B: But don't be ashamed.  Just go with your fear.

% Bart refills his mouth with popcorn.

B: If need be, I'll hold your hand.

% The theater dims and the movie begins.  It looks like one of those cheapo
% 1950's lack-and-white serials.  A flying saucer soars through space and
% lands.  The door opens.  In the doorway stands a three-eyed Bart-alien
% with tentacles for legs.  Bart screams endlessly as Maggie and Lisa hold
% his hand.
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 1:09]
