    ... the obligatory mouse holes?  One in the hallway.  Another in its
        usual spot behind the couch.
    ... the barber is the same one that cuts Bart's hair in [8f11]?

Brian Howard {bh} gives the timing for this short as 1:25, whereas the
syndication package contains only 1:23 of animation.  (Probably clipped
from the beginnings/ends of acts.)

%
% The Simpsons family room.  On the floor are Lisa (playing with a rabbit
% doll) and Maggie (playing with a rattle).  On the couch are Marge
% (knitting a scarf) and Homer (reading the newspaper).  Bart enters
% wearing a sombrero and looks around nervously.  He gradually becomes
% the center of attention as Homer raises his head from the paper.

H: [suspiciously] How come you're always wearing that hat?
B: Fashion statement, Dad.
H: [annoyed] Take off the hat, boy.

% Bart reluctantly does so.  His hair is long.

L: [teasing] Look, he's a beatnik!
M: [gasp!]  You go get a haircut!
H: Right now.

% Bart pushes the hair out of his face.

B: I was afraid this moment would come...

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:19]
%
% Bart's sitting in a barber's chair, the barber standing behind him
% jacking up the chair with his foot.

R: Well, what'll it be, sonny?
B: [not brightly] Just a little off the top, sir.
R: Ah, sure thing.

% Close-up on Bart's face as we hear the scissors (*snip snip*) and
% see hair falling.  Bart watches the hair fall.

R: There ya go.

% The barber spins Bart's chair around so he (and we) can see him in
% the mirror.  Bart is bald.

R: Well, whaddya think?
B: [shocked] What the hell did you do to my head?
R: [as if this happened every day] Well, that'll be five dollars, please.

% The barber shoves a lollipop in Bart's face.

R: Here's a sucker!

% Bart can only stare.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 0:38]
%
% A window.  Bart appears outside, opens the window (*ungh*) and climbs
% in, clutching a paper bag in his left hand.  Bart walks to a table,
% on which is conveniently placed a jar of glue and a piece of cardboard.
% He pours glue on the cardboard, then empties the bag of hair onto it.
% (The hair magically assumes its pre-cut shape.)  Bart then pours glue
% on his head and places the hairy cardboard on his head.  He walks to
% the mirror and smiles at his achievement.  But the smile vanishes from
% his face when the hair falls off the cardboard, leaving Bart with a
% blank piece of cardboard glued to his head.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 0:58]
%
% Back to the Simpsons family room.

H: Isn't that boy back from the barber yet?
L: [snitching] I heard him sneaking around in his bedroom.
H: [calling] Bart!  Front and center!

% Bart comes into the room, hanging his head, which is covered by a
% paper bag.

B: I'll take it off, but you all gotta promise you won't laugh, okay?
   Promise?
H+M+L: We promise.

% Bart removes the bag.
%
% All gasp.
%
% Then snicker.  (Marge and the girls cover their mouths; Homer hides
% behind the newspaper.)
%
% Then burst out laughing.  (Including Maggie.)
%
% [End of Act Four.  Time: 1:23]
