Announcer: Live, from the Springfield Civic Auditorium -- it's the
           Simpsons 138th episode spectacular!
            [trumpet fanfare as Troy McClure walks on]
     Troy: [walking on] Hello, I'm Troy McClure.  You may remember me
           from such Fox network specials as "Alien Nose Job" and "Five
           Fabulous Weeks of `The Chevy Chase Show'".
           Tonight we're here to honor America's favorite non-
           prehistoric cartoon family.  You'll see long lost footage,
           never-before-seen material from your favorite episodes, old
           favorites you can't see in syndication.
            [clips of MG07, 8F13, 2F20, and 9F03 run quickly]
           So join me, won't you, for the Simpsons 138th episode
           spectacular.

> Did you notice...
===============================================================================
Mark Richey:
    ... we learn how to say "Groening"?
    ... Smithers actually does look like a lemur in the WSMB outtake?
    ... there were no "syndication cut-outs" as promised?

Haynes Lee:
    ... Mr. Brooks looks like the tycoon from Monopoly?
    ... Mr. Simon looks like the eccentric Howard Hughes?
    ... the message in Homer's skull: "IOU one brain, signed, God"?

Benjamin Robinson:
    ... after showing the first short, Troy pauses a bit, as if taken
        aback by what he just saw?
    ... Satan's Formula 1 car was sponsored by Duff beer and Laramie
        cigarettes?
    ... Lionel Hutz's pizza is from "Jackie McLean Pizza & Jazz?"
    ... the dreaded robotic Richard Simmons is almost as fat as Homer?

Keith Palmer:
    ... the comics that Matt Groening was supposed to have worked on all
        have Bongo Comics seals?
    ... Santa's Little Helper holds the gun in his mouth to shoot Mr.
        Burns in one of the fake shootings?
    ... all of the fake shootings have the same background and animation
        of Burns?
    ... as one of the commercial breaks begins, Troy walks just off
        stage, seems to become depressed, and lights a cigarette?  (He
        likely didn't care for the episode.)

Dominik Halas:
    ... the living room has been moved?  (the arched doorway normally
        leads into the kitchen, not the hallway.)
    ... Groening is dressed just like Grampa?  (unlike Grampa, he wears
        an eyepatch and recognizes all 50 states)
    ... Brooks has two Emmies and an Oscar?
    ... the Life in Hell poster in Groening's office?

Don Del Grande:
    ... in the list of names, some appear more than once (like Vyolet
        Diaz and Marty Gross)?
    ... Apu fires more than one shot at Burns, so he couldn't have done
        it since only one shot was heard?
    ... whoever did do it used the same bullets as the gun found in
        Homer's car?
    ... "Good Night" has a FOX logo in the corner, but FOX had not
        started using it in 1987?

Ricardo Lafaurie:
    ... unlike the past two clip shows, this episode did not credit the
        collaborative efforts of the writers of the clips shown?
    ... Troy neglects to mention "Life in Hell" as one of Groening's
        comics?
    ... Penny Wise is on the list of people who worked on the Simpsons?
    ... this episode confirms that Dr. Marvin Monroe is dead?
    ... this is the first episode to show episode titles (of other
        episodes, though)?
    ... Homer runs over Bart's bike?
    ... Apu carries an automatic weapon?
    ... apparently, Troy doesn't know that next season is the Simpsons'
        last?
    ... in the nudity scene from 2F07, Marge and Homer seem to have no
        genitals?

In the fake ending of WSMB II, Smithers is shown during the shooting
looking as he normally does.  But in the end of WSMB I and the beginning
of WSMB II, he is unshaven, missing his jacket, and his tie is undone.

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Mark Richey: The best of the clip shows.  The outtakes were very funny.
    The "trivia" was a good send up of that sort, and the alternative
    solution to WSMB was pretty good.  However, when you come right down
    to it, it was still just a clip show.  C+

Dale Abersold: Hardly an episode at all...hardly even a clip show!  The
    clips were terrific, even though the Robotic Richard Simmons was not
    nearly as scary as I had thought it should be.  I also loved the
    O.J. reference about ignoring DNA evidence.  However, if I must give
    the episode a grade, it would be: Incomplete.

Haynes Lee: The producers have learned from last year that they cannot
    stitch together 20 minutes of old material with 5 minutes of new
    material.  The result is a summary episode that should have been
    done a long time ago.  Grade: A-.

Andrew Wagster: This wasn't a terrible episode [despite it being a clips
    episode, which I usually hate], due mainly to Troy McClure, who I
    like.  I got to see a few clips that I'd forgotten about [the
    Flintstones reference cracked me up in particular], so it wasn't a
    total waste.  Grade: B.

Benjamin Robinson: As the televised equivalent to a B-sides album, this
    episode makes a nice curio for the Simpsons fan.  Almost makes up
    for my not getting to see Mr. Silverman's presentation in San
    Francisco.  (B)

John Martin: Please.  Not another clip show!  This one was better than
    the others, in that the writers made it pretty obvious that they
    (and Troy McClure) hate doing this sort of thing.  The "Robotic
    Richards Simmons" clip is the ONLY thing that saves this from the
    garbage dump.  Overall, a D-.

Keith Palmer: I should admit that I don't hate clip shows just for being
    clip shows; I liked the first, but disliked the second.  However,
    this episode's stripped-down frame, blasts from the distant past,
    outtakes, and unique look at Matt Groening made it more original and
    entertaining than its predecessors.  Grade: B+/A-

Dominik Halas: Brilliant!  Much better than the first two clip shows
    because most of the clips they used _weren't_ ones we normally get
    to see.  If Bart's blackboard lines are any indication, they'll do
    another one next year, so producers, take note: _this_ clip show is
    the one to emulate.  Grade: A.

Don Del Grande: C-plus - This is my idea of a "clip show"; however,
    there just weren't enough of the "outtakes" to make it really
    worthwhile, although anyone who never saw the shorts from "The
    Tracey Ullman Show" might like it a little better.  On top of that,
    the promised "syndication outtakes" never appeared.

Scott Fujimoto: This time, the producers made it interesting by
    including stuff that people wouldn't know about unless they watched
    Tracy Ullman or went to one of David Silverman's talks.  Plus a lot
    of great (original) jokes.  I liked it, although they can't pull the
    same stunt again.  Grade: A.

Frederic Briere: If I had to keep only one episode, it would be this
    one.  Not that it was _that_ funny, but it truly kept the feeling of
    every season from the show: this is what the two first clip shows
    should've looked like.  For someone who will never get Comedy
    Central in his life, those Tracey Ullman Shorts were a slice of
    paradise.  (A)

Ricardo Lafaurie: I'm wary of clip shows, but this one was great because
    it had the proper setting (they didn't try to intermingle it with
    the show.)  Watching the Tracey Ullman shorts were good too.  And
    Richdale must have been nuts to let them cut out that robotic
    Richard Simmons!!!  B-.

Jose Lafaurie: Probably the only good clip show ever.  There was just
    one problem - did you notice the pacing was kind of slow.  And to
    top that off, they had to put the Tracey Ullman show, which were,
    like the NeXT computer, built to be slow.  And DYN how Troy spoke?
    There were gaps between every sentence, man.  (C+)

Adam Lipkin: Good lord, they didn't really look like that, did they?
    It's a much bgger change than I thought.  As a clip show it went
    pretty well, considering that most of the clips were never shown
    before.  Troy McClure takes a well-deserved starring role.  Grade:
    B-.

Tony Hill: This was superb, as clip shows go.  It was well-paced,
    acerbic, and witty.  The only detraction was the uniting of truth
    with parody (Captain Wacky, Groening's past, etc.).  I give it an
    A-.

Yours truly: Now that's how a clip show oughta be done.  A terrific
    self-satirizing send-up of the show, with many classic scenes in a
    row plus a rare glimpse at what gets cut...what more could one want?
    As a clip show, A+; as a regular episode, B+.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> "Captain Wacky", a.k.a.  Homer

Ricardo Lafaurie writes, "When Troy said this, it sort of made me think
    about the Tracy Ullman show.  Did you notice that Homer went
    nameless throughout the majority of the shows?  He was even credited
    as `Dad' or `Mr. Simpson.'  Some shorts give Homer's name.  Examples
    follow:

    - "The Pagans"            (MG22)   by  Bart {ddg}
    - "The Aquarium"          (MG24)   by  Bart {ddg}
    - "Zoo Story"             (MG29)   by  Marge {ddg}
    - "Art Museum"            (MG29)   by  Marge
    - "Shut up Simpsons"      (MG30)   by  Grampa and Bart
    - "Home Hypnotism"        (MG32)   by  Marge and Bart {ddg}
    - "Punching Bag"          (MG33)   by  Marge and Bart
    - "Echo Canyon"           (MG36)   by  Bart
    - "The Bart Simpson Show" (MG38)   by  Lisa (!)
    - "Bathtime"              (MG44)   by  Bart
    - "Family Therapy"        (MG47)   by  Bart
    - "T.V. Simpsons"         (MG48)   by  Bart

    Incidentally, Marge was never named until the half-hour show."

>> The Indian movie

This was, apparently, a not-inaccurate portrayal of Indian movies.  The
    man who bursts through the window utters real Hindi curses.  Sarang
    Gupta explains, "According to my Mom, who speaks fluent Hindi (but
    didn't see the show, so I had to pronounce this out loud to her), it
    means `Dog!  (koothay) Mean person!  (kaminay, a swear word in Hindi
    with no real English translation) I am speaking [these insults] to
    those who are eavesdropping/listening to me.  (suun ka va jay)'
    Although it sounds awkward translated, my Mom tells me it's a viable
    insult in Hindi (plus I'm grounded for two weeks...)."

Jay Srinivasan further notes, "The `top 400 list' remark by Apu is a
    reference to the fact that India is the leading producer of movies.
    They have thousands, if not more, every year.  That's why they are
    so crappy.  My mom told me that many movies have weddings where it
    rains, and then there is dancing, not unlike Apu's movie."

>> Domino's Pizza

Their guarantee was delivery in under "30 minutes or your pizza is
    free."  Haynes Lee notes, "However, one of their drivers got into a
    really nasty accident and Domino's got sued big-time.  A really good
    legal reference."

>> Hardcore nudity from 2F07

Benjamin Robinson writes, "If you look carefully, you'll notice that
    another outtake slipped into the nudie montage at the end.  The
    scene where Bart interrupts Homer and Marge's is from `Grampa vs.
    Sexual Inadequacy (2F07),' right?  Wrong!  I checked my tape of the
    original airing, and -- yowsa!  -- we got to see a lot more of her
    this time.  In fact, the scene that did air looks comparatively
    crude, as if the censors balked at the last minute and ordered a re-
    do.  Well, I guess this makes up for dropping the `doggy leapfrog'
    scene from `Two Dozen & One Greyhounds (2F18).'"

Troy: "The Simpsons" began as the brainchild of cartoonist Matt
      Groening,
       [screen shows a bald man with an eyepatch saluting in front of a
      US flag and looking menacing]
      the already-famous creator of such comics as "Damnation", "Johnny
      Reb", and "True Murder Stories".  [screen shows each]
      In 1987, Groening teamed up with award-winning producers James L.
      Brooks
       [shot of 8F01-esque rich man surrounded by bags of money]
      and Sam Simon.
       [shot of Howard Hughes-esque naked man typing in bed]
      And what better place to premiere their creation than on "The
      Tracy Ullman Show", the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes
      and musical comedy numbers?  On April 19th, 1987, America first
      met "The Simpsons".

          top of the world.  So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge
          my sweet tooth.
           [walks toward parking lot]
          I feel like celebrating.  [sees Maggie] Oh, it's you.  What
          are you so happy about?
           [she smiles, holding up a lollipop]
           [gasps] I see.
           [voiceover] Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take
          candy from a baby.  But with him out of the picture, I was
          free to wallow in my own crapulence.  Or so I thought -- but
          at the last moment, Smithers, drunk as a lemur, lurched out of
          the darkness and fired.
Smithers: [remembering] That's right.  Right before I shot Jasper.  Hmm,
          I was busy that night.
   Burns: [voiceover] Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid, but
          finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on
          the sundial.
    Lisa: Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and
          S: "Waylon Smithers".
   Marge: Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've
          recovered and that we can all get back to normal.
   Burns: Not exactly.  Smithers, for attempting to kill me, I'm giving
          you a 5% pay cut.
Smithers: [howling] Ohh.
    Troy: But of course, for that ending to work, you would have to
          ignore all the Simpson DNA evidence.  [laughs] And that would
          be downright nutty.
-- The alternate ending to 2F20 ("Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"), "The
    Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular"

% The camera shows two photos of the Simpson family, one from an early
% Tracy Ullman short, the other from a modern episode.

Troy: Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way since an old drunk made
      humans out of his rabbit characters to pay off his gambling debts.
      Who knows what adventures they'll have between now and the time
      the show becomes unprofitable?
      I'm Troy McClure, and I'll leave you with what we all came here to
      see: hardcore nudity!
