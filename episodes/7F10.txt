Blackboard :- `I will not sell school/property'.
              `I will not sell schoo' at cutoff.

Driveway   :- no oil on the driveway.
              Homer does not shake his fist at Bart.
              Homer says Aaagh! when Lisa scoots past.

Couch:     :- Homer bumps everybody off the couch.

> Didja notice...
===============================================================================

    ... nary two seconds after we see `Bart Gets Hit by a Car',
        Bart gets hit by a car?
    ... the Devil is using a windowing interface to his computer?
    ... when Homer is called into Mr. Burns' office (the first time),
        there is a line of attorneys standing next to Burns' desk,
        and at the end of the line is a stuffed mounted polar bear?
    ... Della is reading `Popular Secretary'?
    ... when Burns and Smithers spy on Marge and Homer through the painting,
        Burns looks through the eyes of a portrait of Mr. Burns, and
        Smithers bends over to look through the eyes of Burns' dog?
        [I'll leave the `bends over' part to the people who like to
        argue about whether Mr. Burns is a Homer-sexual.]
    ... Doctor Julius Hibert went to Johns Hopkins?
    ... when Hutz buries his head in his hands after Marge ruins his case,
        there are crumpled up pieces of paper and a broken pencil on the
        table in front of him?

[John Kupec]
    ... one of the stores in opening scene is named `Cloth Store'?
    ... Burn's limo has an atom hood ornament?
    ... green goo dripping all over the nuclear power plant?
    ... Hutz's secretary's name is Della as in Perry Mason?

[Thomas Skrobala]
    ... that Judge Moulton looked a lot like non-Supreme-Court-justice
        Robert Bork?

Also, when Burns' attorney asked Marge for her opinion of Dr. Riviera,
notice that Lionel Hutz didn't raise any objection?  It seems he
didn't learn much about law at the Louvre Law School...

Some people note that Homer indignantly turns down Burns's offer of $500,000
even though that's what he would've gotten if he had won the lawsuit once he
paid Hutz's 50% fee.  But Hutz probably would have claimed 50% of the $500,000
settlement, leaving Homer with $250,000.

===============================================================================
> Movie References
===============================================================================
  ~ A Tale of Two Cities
        - After hitting Bart, Burns says, ``Just give him a nickel
          and let's get going.''  In the book, the Marquis St. Evremonde
          runs over a boy in the street and just tosses the father a coin.
          Gaspard (the father) refused the coin and instead murdered the
          Marquis.  Wonder if Burns knew... {jdlb}
  + Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516), `Garden of Earthly Delights'
        - the rendition of Hell
  + Rolling Stones, `Sympathy for the Devil'
        - Satan says, `Please allow me to introduce myself.'
  + Wizard of Oz
        - Bart waking up from his `dream' saying `And you were there,
          and you and you...'
  + Miracle on 34th Street
        - Judge asking Bart if he knows the difference between telling
          the truth and telling a lie.
    ? Some as-yet unidentified movie ?
        - Burns cradling Bart's head in his lap (in the Burns version)
          and the camera pulling upward with a crowd of people surrounding
          him.
          Guesses include
            - The Last Picture Show, when the poolroom owner's adopted son
              gets tagged by a semi while sweeping the street. {rc}
            - The Pulitzer-Prize-winning photo of the Kent State Massacre
              of May 1970.
            - Colors, when Robert Duvall is shot. {sy}
            - The Human Comedy, ``check it out if you don't believe me'' {sf}
            - Potemkin, when the mother holds her dead child {jev}
            - Rebel Without a Cause, ``I'm pretty sure'' {ja}
            - Romeo and Juliet, the final scene {din}
            - West Side Story, the final scene {din}
            - Superman, when Superman finds Lois Lane dead {sp}
            - Twilight Zone, `In Praise of Pip', when Jack Klugman
              prays for his son, he says something like ``Take me,
              I'm old.'' {wb}
          and probably the best guess
            - Darby O'Gill and the Little People (Sean Connery)
              Towards the end of the movie, old man Darbys' daughter disobeys
              her fathers commands and goes up a mountain after a horse (storm
              coming).  She trips over a ledge and is knocked unconsious.
              Fearing the Banshee curse placed on Darby will claim another
              victim, he races after her and finds her lying on the ground.
              Cradling her head in his lap, and with the camera pulling back,
              yells out at the approching banshee ``Go away!  Take me I'm
              old!''  Darby throws a lantern at the hag, who disappears, then
              he and her boyfriend (Connery) carry her back home.
              {cjb's brother}

===============================================================================
> Bart's visit to Hell
===============================================================================
Several people have pointed out that the rendition of Hell is taken
Bosch's ``Garden of Earthly Delights''

As to what computer system the devil was using, I personally doubt very
much the writers had a particular system in mind.  Assorted evidence:

    The mouse had only one button. (suggests Macintosh)
    the pull-down menu did not come from a menu bar. (rules out Macintosh)
    there was more than one type of menu pulled out of thin air.
        (rules out Windows 3, SunView)
    the menu changed without having to press the mouse button.
        (rules out everything else)

Note, though, that the devil was right-handed.  So much for `sinister'
intentions...

===============================================================================
> Bart's return to the world of the living
===============================================================================

+ Bart passes through earth with dinosaur fossils embedded in it.

+ The Flanderses were getting booster shots on the ground floor of the
  hospital; how typically responsible of them. [David Tamkin]

+ the sign on the door reads `State Booster Program'. [Joe Kincaid]

+ The syringe you see is not a real syringe, but rather is part of the
  inoculation poster. [Thomas C. Allard]

+ The sign on the door reads `Authorized Personnel Only'. [Jeffrey R Carden]

+ Jacques is seeing his proctologist, probably more out of need than
  Flanders-like prevention. [David Tamkin]

+ Bart passes by a room where a body with a toe tag lies in bed.

===============================================================================
> Lionel Hutz, the Lawyer
===============================================================================
[David Tamkin]

Hutz's sponge card (a degree from the Louvre?) tells us to dial KL 5-LAWW;
he's been clogging our courts since 1974.  [1976, actually. --rjc]

===============================================================================
> `Doctor' Riviera
===============================================================================
[David Tamkin]

The block from Hutz's office to Riviera's had ``(Something) Nook'' on the
corner, then ``[Your?] Law Offices of Lionel Hutz,'' then ``Gum for Less,''
[which Joe Kincaid points out is a new low in niche marketing] and
finally ``Dr. Nick Riviera, general specialist credit doctor.''  Signs in
Riviera's office windows read ``Yes, we're open'' and ``Yes, we use
anesthetic.''  How reassuring.

Riviera's degrees read ``Mayo Clinic Correspondence School,'' ``Club Med
School,'' ``Female Body Inspector,'' (how about ``Female Body Impersonator''?),
and ``I went to medical school for four years and all I got was this lousy
diploma.''  But as Hutz said, Riviera was the only person in the room who
even came close to being a doctor.

===============================================================================
> Burns' story
===============================================================================
From: jasmerb@prism.cs.orst.edu (Bryce Jasmer)

Burns driving in that pink VW Bug with purple flowers. I think it was the
music that really made it great.

[dattier@ddsw1.MCS.COM (David W. Tamkin) and jwk@Scripps.EDU (John Kupec)
confirm that the music was "Tijuana Taxi" by Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass.]

===============================================================================
> Lisa's role
===============================================================================
Lisa has but five lines in the entire episode (sigh):

1) Excuse me, Mr. Hutz.  Are you a shyster?
2) Hello, Dr. Hibbert.
3) Dad, may I please make an observation?
4) I think this is all a charade to make Bart look
   more injured than he really is.
5) Mmm.
