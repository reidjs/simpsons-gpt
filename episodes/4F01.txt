       against him?

Dallas Pesola:
   ... the number on the AT-5000 when it is seen in the dumpster is
       553-4891-2? (the last digit is between 1 and 2 on the tumbler)
   ... the '553' prefix is not the norm of '555' for TV/movies? (makes

   ... this is the first time the white font has been used over normal

> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
==============================================================================
+  Skinner does have a car.  He is seen in one in 1F07 and his mother
   took his keys from him in 1F04.

=  The mark left behind by the stolen "H" isn't there when Skinner looks
   at the end of the car.  It miraculously appears when Chalmers talks
   about "Superintendant Money"  {ol}

+  If Kearney has a car, how come he is always riding the school bus?
   {ol}

=  Homer leaves the Kwik-E-Mart empty handed, yet the shot of him going
   to his car shows him holding something.

=  A coat hook appears in Nelson's locker after the first shot.  {jw2}

=  The hole in Nelson's locker is much bigger when we first see it.
   {dp2}

-  The caged lobster Nelson stole was red, which could only happen after
   it were boiled.  {gg}

=  Lisa's microscope disappears after she shows it to Nelson.  {dh}

c  The first call from the AT-5000 is dubbed "Greetings, friend",
   whereas it says "friends" afterwards.

=  On one shot of the music band, Ralph is taking Wanda's place at
   triangle.

+  "Pop Goes the Weasel" was the "forbidden music", as far as Mr. Largo
   was concerned, in "The PTA Disbands" [2F19].  {dga}

*  Both Janey and Uter joined in the "_____ loves _____" chants they
   immediately denied.  {mar}

*  How does Lisa write so far up on the chalkboard?  {ddg}

*  Each board has "I WILL NOT BE A SNICKERPUSS." written 14 times; if
   Lisa's using something that writes five lines at a time, there should
   be a multiple of five lines on each board.

    [Maybe she took off a piece of chalk to write the last four lines.
     -- {ljs}]

*  When Lisa is looking at Nelson, the last board only has 12 lines, and
   one is shorter than the others.  {ddg}

+  Lisa says that Nelson is her first crush but in 3F17 she admits to
   Homer that she has a crush on Langdon Alger.  {jw}

=  While Milhouse is sitting down in the cafeteria, Sherri and Terri can
   be seen at a table at the back of the room.  When he starts to walk
   off, one of the twins has moved next to Ralph.  {mar}

=  When Lisa tells Milhouse he's "like a big sister", many kids change
   position for that shot only.  {dh}

-  Nothing seems to be written on Lisa's note before she folds it.  {ol}

=  Lisa's note was not written on line paper.  But it becomes line paper
   when the note is passed.  {ol}

=  The carriage disappears when Bart enters Lisa's room.  Then it ends
   up on the side of the bed even though no one seemed to have moved it.
   {ol}

+  Bart is semi-friends with Nelson, so shouldn't be too shocked to find
   him in the house.  {mar}

=  The carriage disappears when Bart enters Lisa's room.  Then it ends
   up on the side of the bed even though no one seemed to have moved it.
   {ol}

*  How does Frink know that auto-dialer was his?  {ol}

*  When Professor Frink got the autodialer to "escape", the only cord
   connected to it was the power cord; if there was no phone cord, how
   was it connected to the phone line?  {ddg}

*  The autodialer is able to run after the plug was pulled out.  {hl}

*  It appears throughout his entire performance that Nelson's guitar has
   a capo on the fourth or fifth fret, yet when he tunes the guitar, he
   plays the frets above the capo, while plucking the strings down at
   the base of the guitar. It sounds as if he's actually playing the
   notes, while in reality this is impossible because any notes above
   the capo are muted completly.  {ph}

-  When Nelson plays the guitar on his shelf, his right foot goes
   through the lamp's base.

=  When Marge picks Lisa up at Nelson's she's driving with
   her left foot on the accelerator, but she switches to the right
   in the last cut.  {rg}

+  Lisa said to Bart that you can't change a person [2F04], yet now, she
   unsuccessfully tries to prove herself wrong.  {ak}

*  Exactly how late was Lisa out with Nelson?  Before she got home, both
   her parents and the Flanders had gone to bed (or tried to, at least).
   Wouldn't Marge have stayed up to wait for her eight-year-old
   daughter?  {mar}

-  When Lisa talks to Nelson about "green hills", the hills are purple.
   {bb}

*  When Nelson kisses Lisa, she's thinking it's her first kiss, but she
   was kissed by a boy before, in "Bart the General"

    [No doubt Lisa means the first kiss that she willingly gives to
    another boy. -- {dga}]

*  When Nelson kisses Lisa, the close-up and the long shot have the
   Moon's crescent facing different directions, whereas a line
   connecting the "points" of the crescent should go through the center
   of the moon's visible circle.
   (Maybe it was a full moon and Burns decided to test out his latest
   moon-blocking disk, only to realize it was a little small?)  {ddg}

*  When Nelson kisses Lisa, the moon's crescent is lit on the left side,
   but this means that it's just before sunrise, not just after sunset.
   {ddg}

*  The moon's crescent gets smaller in the last scene of Lisa's kiss.
   {ddg}

+  Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney have all proven to be interested in girls.
   Remember [8F24] "Kamp Krusty", when they head across the lake to
   "meet some tail"?  Or [9F06] "New Kid on the Block", with Jimbo's
   "romance" of Laura Powers?

+  Jimbo's real name was Corky in 3F12.

=  Kearney didn't have the Krusty coleslaw until he shows it to Nelson,
   for which it disappears afterwards.  {dh}

*  How come Ned and Maude don't deal out their scamming with Homer? (His
   voice is on the phone and he gives his address, which is next door.)
   {ljs}

+  Wasn't Skinner's house a bungalow in previous episodes?  {dh}

=  Nelson's sweater vanishes after he takes it off.  {dh}

*  How did the cops know Nelson was hiding at the Simpsons'?  {ol}

*  Do Lou, Eddie or Wiggum ever sleep?  They are on patrol in the middle
   of the night.  {ol}

*  The chief smashed the autodialer thingy up pretty well, yet Homer got
   it to work for his "sorry dude" thingy at the end.

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  The first truly great episode of the season.  Mike
   Scully takes an unpromising premise (Nelson and Lisa?) and turns it
   into a humorous look at preteen love.  Although the subplot of
   Homer's autodialer was fairly useless, it was funny and didn't
   detract from anything.  To this entire episode I must say, "it's
   funny, 'cause it's true."  (A+)

Greg Bigoni:  When I first heard the premise of "Lisa's Date With
   Density," I figured it would be another ep where she would be wildly
   out of character in order to make a plotline "work." It's been done
   before... she was self-righteous and angry in "Lisa the Vegetarian,"
   hyperactive and compulsive in "The PTA Disbands," and so on... but
   this time, it all worked. Lisa didn't compromise her own personality
   or values in order to go out with Nelson, and she remained
   intelligent, even realistic, throughout the full duration of the
   show. The Homer subplot was great, too, and there wasn't any doubt
   that this was something Homer would do (unlike most Homer stories
   from this season). Skinner, Wiggum, and Flanders were all hilarious,
   and I especially liked Milhouse this time. Aside from a few
   continuity screw-ups (Jimbo "Dr. Tongue" Jones and the
   recently-divorced Kearney berating Nelson for kissing a girl) it was
   the best ep they've had this season, finally restoring my hope for
   it. (A)

Jennifer M. Blaske:  I imagine a lot of people didn't like this episode,
   but I enjoyed it quite a bit, mostly because it was about Lisa and a
   return to a "normal plot." Some may say that her crush on Nelson made
   no sense, but I think I actually was Lisa twenty years ago, and it
   made perfect sense to me. (Although I do admit it would have made
   more sense if she were about 13.) The scene in the band room was
   particularly poignant and funny. And kudos to Lisa for learning at
   age eight what most grown women still haven't figured out!  (A-)

Stephan Bonneville:  Although this episode was not great nor was it very
   memorable, it had it's moments.  The best part of it was the watering
   scene with Nelson and Willie, but the gag with Milhouse and the
   "guess who likes you?" note also deserved an honourable mention.
   Despite this, writing an entire show about Nelson just seemed to make
   it too juvenile. "The Lisa likes Milhouse!" joke(?) had an all too
   irritating element to it, and Nelson's "Joy to the World" was stupid
   and obviously unoriginal. The writers can do better then that.  (B-)

Steve Frayne:  One of the best Lisa-based episodes ever, but more time
   should've been spent on the subplot (Homer's telemarketing scam).  I
   was glad to see that Nelson never actually showed any sign of
   changing his character, as the kiss was without sincerity.  I own a
   Honda, so I particularly liked the beginning, but a Lisa episode is
   still a Lisa episode, and the best of those still only gets a C-.

Joshua Fruhlinger:  Not as awful as some of the other posters have
   claimed.  It seemed to lack a certain punch, but the whole thing was
   generally watchable and had some funny moments.  I liked the fact
   that they made Nelson somewhat human but left is character more or
   less intact.  The auto-dialer plot was very funny, and led to a great
   Frink moment.  Best line: "You're kissing a girl?  That's so gay!"
   Followed closely by "Nuke the Indians and take their casinos."  (B-)

Jason Hancock:  This was a mixed bag, to say the least.  Although the
   main plot with Lisa and Nelson was something I could relate to, it
   did drag on at times.  On the other hand, the subplot was hilarious
   and proves that a good subplot can save an otherwise weak episode. My
   favorite part would have to be Ned's battle with the phone.  (B)

Andrew Krupowicz:  For some reason I found the plot, Lisa+Nelson, sick.
   Some parts were great, including the auto-dialer subplot, and the
   resolution to it, and the whole scene in music class. The latter part
   started to sag a little, pulling down a great opening, but the
   Milhouse, and prof. Frink gags were great!  (B)

Ondre Lombard:  This episode was jam-packed with hilarious gags and
   funny jokes that flowed well together, but the brilliant subplot with
   Homer's telemarketing scam should've been saved for another episode
   to make more room for development on this story.  Lisa's way of
   changing Nelson might've come out better if per say she got him to
   open up about his miserable family life.  The kiss, like most of
   everything about this plot, was animated with no feel or emotion at
   all.  Lisa and Nelson's lips met and they just froze there.  Bart at
   least could've been concerned with what Lisa was getting into, but he
   was barely in the picture.  The breakup was too sudden and
   unrealistic, as if nothing was there in the first place.  All and
   all, it had potential to be a great story, but it was ruined,
   partially due to time eaten up by the brilliant, but cluttering
   subplot of Homer's scheme.  (C+)

Blaine Moller:  All in all a very good episode. A lot of great gags,
   skinner paying his mom for the food he ate as a child, hoping to be a
   car owner someday etc... I never would have thought an episode about
   Lisa and Nelson would be that good, what a surprise. Would have liked
   to have seen a bit more of Homer but none the less a Great episode!
   (B+)

David Ney:  A good episode.  The subplot about Homer and his
   telemarketing scam was a great idea!  It really seemed like something
   Homer was bound to do sometime.  I thought that Lisa being attracted
   to Nelson under any circumstances was a little far fetched, but hey,
   after 160 episodes I can see how the writers could resort to a
   strange love connection.  Nelson harassing Willie had me ROTFL, and
   the whole thing about Homer's auto dialer constantly calling Ned was
   also cool.  (B+)

Werner Peeters:  Nice storyline, Nelson is the true star of this episode
   ("Joy to the world, the teacher's dead!"), and finally we had another
   story with a brilliant subplot (Homer the spammer!) Great situation
   humour (the reaction of Bart when Nelson appears in his house),
   although sometimes the pace of the episode slows down too much,
   otherwise this would have been an A.  (B+)

Damian Penny:  This confirms that the show is bouncing back after a
   mediocre season 7, because this one took the most unlikely of plots
   (Lisa gets a crush on Nelson!) and makes it very funny.  Nelson
   rocking out on the guitar had me laughing for a LONG time, and I also
   loved the jabs at Honda owners, Milhouse's crush on Lisa, the
   "Milhouse loves Lisa...Janie loves Milhouse" scene, and Willy trying
   to train Nelson in using the 'hooze'.  I didn't think they could pull
   it off, but they did.  (A-)

Mark Aaron Richey:  For some reason, I simply couldn't get into this
   one.  The major reason is that I never bought the idea that Lisa and
   Nelson could fall in "like" with each other...until the very end
   (more on that in a second). Even if Lisa liked Nelson, I can't figure
   out why in the world Nelson would like Lisa, or even want to hang out
   with her (after all, she is two years (at least) younger than he is,
   which is a huge age gap in elementary school).  At the end, however,
   Lisa and Nelson's break-up still saddened me, if for no other reason
   than the looks on their faces (though I found the dialouge to be
   somewhat sappy). The telemarketing subplot had tons of potential, but
   I don't think the writers were able to captilaze on it.  Only two
   scenes in the subplot lived completely up to expectations-the Mr.
   Burns scene and the scene where Homer drives his car onto the front
   yard in a hurry to get the mail.  Every other scene failed to work
   the way it should have, espically the Ned & Maude scene, which went
   on for far too long.  Sad to say, a great disappointment.  (C-)

Matt Rose:  Cute. I have a feeling I'm alone on this but I really
   enjoyed this episode. When I first heard about the plot idea I
   couldn't believe my ears and I was among the doubters that such a
   thing could happen  but as it turned out it worked for me. My only
   complaint is that perhaps the ending was a bit rushed. That aside, I
   found myself laughing hard frequently (FRINK!) and of course it being
   about Lisa makes it that much better. Best one this year, so far.
   (A)

Nelson Seggley:  I thought this episode was hilarious. It brought a
   character to the forefront that has always amused me- Nelson Muntz.
   There were less laffs-a-minute, but more sustaining incidents of
   hilarity. The incident with Homerchasing Frink's auto-dial machine
   was a classic. Other good gags included Nelson's song (the lyrics are
   old; the punk rave-up new.), the whole music class scene (Lisa, does
   the word tromboner amuse you?), the look on Milhouse's face when
   Nelson looks back at him after reading the note, the Flanders'
   problems with the teledialer, and the whole "Happy-dude" thing.  (A-)

Aaron Varhola: A frustrating episode.  We get to see more of Nelson and
   what may have turned him into a bully, more of Milhouse and
   foreshadowing of what may happen several years down the road, but the
   episode stopped short; maybe a minute more emphasis on three scenes:
   the Lisa meeting Milhouse scene, the scene with Lisa and Marge
   talking in the car, and Nelson explaining that his father went crazy,
   would have made the episode a top-notch one.  Most parents wouldn't
   let their 8-year-old daughter date, as well, but that's beside the
   point here.  (B+)

Matthew Williams:  My GOD, that was funny. I really liked the Nelson
   gags, such as Milhouse's severe beating, and Willie's "huse" gags.
   But the highlight of the show was the pretty dang funny Homer
   Telemarketing scam. The Flanders' repeated telephone calls had me
   rolling on the floor. Also, the ending was hilarious.  (A+)

Yours Truly:  Yes, I was _very_ apprehensive towards this episode, even
   to wonder if I should even watch it. But I did, and it brought me
   that kind of feeling I once got from 2F15 and 3F22. After reflexion,
   I found out that the silliness of the starting idea had been
   restrained to the last 20 seconds of acts I and II, thus clearing out
   the way for a wonderful episode. It's not everyday that you get a
   nice and somewhat touching Lisa plot, along with a hilarious subplot.
   All in all, definitely grade-A material, only brought down by sparks
   of mischaracterization and that dreadful kiss.  (A-)


AVERAGE GRADE:  B+ (3.3)

NIELSEN RATING:  7.4  (ranked 63rd out of 119)  {ol}

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Writer Watch

Dale G. Abersold:  Mike Scully has had a somewhat checkered history with
   the series.  Only his first effort, "Lisa's Rival" [1F17] has been
   generally liked by the a.t.s populace.  His other efforts include
   "Lisa on Ice" [2F05], "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [2F18], "Marge
   Be Not Proud" [3F07], and "Team Homer" [3F10].  This episode sure
   improves his stock in my book, though.


>> Why so many voice actors take the bus

Matt Rose:  This is a weird, somewhat far-fetched reference that some
   may find hard to swallow but I thought I'd pass it along. Chalmers
   buys a car (a Honda Accord) and brags about making "superintendant
   money" which enables him to buy a car. I read somewhere that Yeardley
   Smith has owned one car in her life (an Accord); I wonder if this is
   a stab at how much money the voice actors on the show make, i.e.,
   "real" actors all make millions and drive fancy cars, while they
   (voice actors) are stuck with Hondas. Perhaps I've been reading too
   much about their personal lives. 


>> Blood on the blackboard: The Bart Simpson story

Ondre Lombard:  As most can tell, Lisa's question "How does Bart do this
   every week?" is a clear slice of meta-humor on the opening theme.
   Ironically, Lisa is made to write on various blackboards, compared to
   the one blackboard in his class he writes on every week.  This joke
   might've been funnier had their been a blackboard scene this episode.
   But yet again we're disappointed with nothing more than a couch
   scene.  Wonder how long those will last.


>> It seems like I've been wearing this same red dress forever

Michael Baer:  I think the episode underscored the fact that the
   Simpsons characters are truly two-dimensional (figuratively as well
   as literally).  They can never be pegged down to a catch-phrase (as
   in "Bart Gets Famous"), and are thus interesting.  On the other hand,
   they are developed as true humans (which is best saved for drama, not
   comedy/satire) and never change (thus ensuring ad infinitum
   continuity).

   However, this continuity is changing with time, or so it seems.
   Milhouse's long-standing crush (a la "Lisa's Wedding") is beginning,
   and Lisa does seem awfully young for a first kiss.  Now the only
   major character they haven't put through the motions romantically (I
   didn't count "Lisa's Substitute" or "Lisa's Wedding") has been
   Maggie, and it kind of makes me wonder when they'll break down and do
   that.

Edward W. Clayton:  Is it just me, or was it really out of character for
   Lisa to not blow up at Nelson for beating up Milhouse? I mean, I'm
   sort of surprised that the writers would use a scene of a bully
   beating up someone he thinks is gay as laugh material in the first
   place, but isn't Lisa far too liberal to put up with that -- even if
   she does have a crush on Nelson?


>> And a howdily-diddely to you

Dave Hall's simple list of "expletives" used in this episode:

     "Holy jumping Censor's Catfish!"
     "Balderdash!"
     "Damn! Dang! Darn!"
     "Dang!"
     "Shoot!"
     "Great barrier reef!"


>> What's that song again?

Dale G. Abersold:  Before this episode, none of the previous _eight_
   used the normal Simpsons closing theme music, last heard in "Much Apu
   About Nothing" [3F20].  While only an excerpt of the music was played
   (since most of the time was devoted to Homer's hilarious telephone
   apology), it was still nice to hear it again.  Anyway, the substitute
   music has been...

    [3F21] The Simpsons theme as interpreted by Sonic Youth
    [3F22] "All Summer Long" by the Beach Boys
    [4F02] The Simpsons theme, Hallowe'en style
    [3F23] The "Scorpio" song
    [4F03] "People" sung by a Barbra Streisand sound-alike
    [4F05] "Any Way You Want It" by Journey
    [4F06] "We Put the Spring in Springfield" reprise
    [4F04] The Simpsons theme, done as a mellow 70's love ballad


>> Loose Ends

Benjamin Jay Robinson:  The promo showed Lisa riding on the back of
   Nelson's bike, a scene which wasn't used in the episode.

Mark Aaron Richey:  A few years back, there was a trend going around
   where people would yank the decal off of a high-priced car.  As I
   recall, Mercades were hit the hardest, though other upscale brands
   were at risk too (I recall my uncle's BMW emblem being stolen off his
   car).

James R. Curry reports no cuts on SKY. (Good!)
