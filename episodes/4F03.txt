==============================================================================
   Homer's ability to take a punch inspires ex-boxer Moe to turn him
   into a prizefighter. Ring announcer Michael Buffer calls the contest
   when Moe's former manager (voice of Paul Winfield) arranges for Homer
   to meet the champ.

              I am not my long-lost twin  at cutoff.

Couch      :- The couch is outside in a southwestern desert; everyone is
              in cowboy gear as they sit on it, which then gallops away.

       had never previously fought before?
   ... The announcer said that all dignity in pro boxing is going right
       out the window, when actually Moe & Homer were flying through the
       roof?

> Movie (and other) references
==============================================================================
   + Mike Tyson, Don King, Fan Man  [see comments]

   + Various Boxing References  {hl}
      - Mohammed Ali's post boxing career physical illness caused by too
        many blows to the head.
      - Organized crime allegations, Fat Tony in audience.
      - Ringside doctors are under-qualified quacks, Dr. Nick Riviera.

   + "The bigger they are, the harder they fall" -- common phrase  {rl}
      - title

   + The Sharper Image  {bjr}
      - Miscellaneous, Etc. based on this personal gadget store
      - similar expensive, unusual merchandise (I think The Sharper
        Image might actually have sold an electric nose hair trimmer at
        one time)
      - store decor, with horizontal wood slats, the same

   + "Doctor Who"  {mk}
      - displays in the technology store are shaped similar to the
        TARDIS's main console

     "Speed"  {dp}
      - close-up on Bart's turn signal similar to a shot in the movie

   + "The Great White Hype"  {bah}
      - satire about the whole boxing scene pretty identical in style in
        both the movie and this episode.

   + "Flower Duet", from opera Lakme by Leo Delibes  {dga}
      - music during the B&W scene where Homer becomes Springfield champ

      Boxcar Willie  {dp}
      - a boxer in the Springfield Semi-Pro Association is named "Boxcar
        Ira"

   + "Raging Bull", movie
      - black and white boxing scenes in the middle of the episode
        {psk}
      - during the black and whtie montage, Homer is seen wearing
        sunglasses and a hawaiian shirt, very similar to that of
        Deniro's LaMotta  {st}
      - various slow-motion shots during the final bout  {bt}

   + "Rocky" / "Prize Fighter"  {dn}
     - Homer running along side Moe on a bicycle

   + "Rocky"
     - a lot of the training sequences
     - the ending part where Marge asks Moe not to let Homer fight (I
       think)  {rl}
     - Burgess Meredith says to Sylvester Stallone: "You will always be
       a loser"  {hl}

     "Mike Tyson's Punchout", Nintento video game  {bah}
      - Homer's opponents look like boxers from the video game popular
        in the late 80s. At the end of the episode like at the end of
        the game, the opponent is Mike Tyson (aka Drederick Tatum in
        "The Homer They Fall".) and he's unbeatable.

   ~ "The Godfather"  {rl}
      - probably not, but the scene after Lucius Sweet talks to Moe
        reminds me of the end of the movie

   + Heidi Fliess Scandal  [see comments]
      - Rainier Wolfecastle caught in "Hollywood Prostitution Scandal"
      - Charlie Sheen in boxing audience

   + "Why Can't We Be Friends?", '70s song by War  {jh}
      - Homer chose this song as his theme

   + "Time 4 Sum Aksion", by Redman  {mf}
      - Tatum chose this song, just like Tyson did for his first fight
        after jail

   + "People Who Need People", Barbra Streisand song from '60s "Funny
      Girl"  {mar}
      - song over the closing credits

=  The crowd at the "Bonanza" celebration suddenly shrinks.  {mar}

c  When the crowd boos the Indian guys from Bonanza, the CC shows Homer
   saying "Lousy Native Americans!" but you don't hear it.  (Obviously
   the producers cowered just before air time.)

+  In "Bart the General" [7G05] Homer tells Bart after getting beat up
   by school bully not do break the sacred "code of the schoolyard" by
   squealing.

c  The final bell ring of act I is not captioned.

+  Moe has had woman in his bar on several occasions:
   - [7G10] Moe holds LADIES NIGHT. Blatant enough.
   - [7F10] Marge confronts Homer after losing their million dollar
            lawsuit
   - [8F04] Lisa is having a chocolate milk with her father
   - [8F08] There were several woman in Moe's when his Flaming Moe's
            were hot: Maude, Edna Krabappel and his waitress are a few
            examples.
   - [9F06] Ruth Powers uses her free beer coupon
   - [9F19] Bette Midler is at Moe's after Krusty's comeback special
            {ol}
   - [3F02] There were many woman at Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag
   - [4F03] Interestingly enough, there *are* woman at the fight!  {rl}

*  The male restroom has stalls, so why would the female restroom only
   have one seat?  {mar}

+  Moe already has a backroom that he uses as an office.  {mar}

*  A restroom like that would have a lockable doorknob, not have a
   push-open door.  {mar}

+  During the first breakfast scene, Lisa appears to have bacon on her
   plate.

+  Homer's age is usually 36, except in 2F07.  {rl}

+  Homer has exercised many times after grade school:
   - [7F12] Refers Marge to Coach Flanagan  {ns}
   - [7F18] Lifts weights and jumps rope  {rl}
   - [8F12] Climbs Mt. Springfield with Lisa
   - [8F13] Plays baseball  {rl}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold: There's not much you can do with the basic plot, but
   this one was amusing enough.  Paul Winfield was great as Lucius
   Sweet, and it was amusing to see the Comic Book Guy meet his
   sarcastic match.  The episode was filled throughout with great gags
   in the cynical Simpson tradition, but was unfortunately marred by the
   tacked-on sappy ending.  What was an "A" degraded to...  (B+)

Brad Barth: When "The Simpsons" tackles sports, the result is often a
   knockout. This was just short of one, but still funny as the corrupt
   sport of boxing was a target with a glass jaw. Like the stamina of
   Homer's early sparring opponents, the humor at times wears thin. But
   Bart's belt gag, the neat "Raging Bull" spoof, an amusing pre-fight
   sequence, and the punishment Homer takes won me over. Best was the
   emphasis on Moe, who was as funny and 3-dimensional as he's ever
   been. His youthful days keep getting more interesting now that we can
   add boxing career to his resume right after his stint as a Little
   Rascal. And his hijacking of the Fan-Man suit was a great conclusion.
   I judge, unanimously, in its favor.  (B+)

Chris Courtois: To paraphrase Lisa, "The Homer They Fall" was a rather
   lifeless outing. While it didn't suck and there were a few good gags
   scattered throughout (the surgical 2x4 was funny, as was "This just
   in - Go to hell!" and Moe's cigar dispenser), the episode seemed a
   bit flat. The Homer as pugilist storyline was a bit too slim to
   sustain the entire episode, and this episode took on the more recent
   subplot-sets-up-main-plot-and-is-never-heard-from- again structure.
   On the satirical front, the episode did manage a few good jabs at the
   world of boxing, but it never reached the biting level of "Lisa the
   Greek" or even the level of the boxing scenes from "Homer vs. Lisa
   and the Eighth Commandment".  (C-)

James R Curry : Certainly a far better episode than many in the last
   season, many great gags, and it didn't seem rushed, like a few of
   last year's did.  I was ROFL at Homer's "Happy Anniversary, Baby!". I
   do find myself questioning Moe's background as a boxer, but never
   mind.. It was a funny episode, and that's what The Simpsons is all
   about. (B+)

Jason Hancock: Despite another far-fetched premise and a few notable
   goofs, I thought this was a decent episode.  The satire of the
   corrupted sport of boxing was dead-on, and it was nice to see the
   Comic Book Guy get a taste of his own medicine for once!  (B+)

Brian Haugen: After the first viewing of this episode I truly thought it
   deserved at most a "D". But after the 2nd viewing I truly appreciated
   more the finesse of it all and some of the angles and realisation
   bits were really quite impressive. Moe, Lucious and Tatum weren't too
   stereotyped which is a good thing. The lack of originality doesn't
   make this one a "B" in my book.  (C+)

Patrick Hayden: I just could not find much to laugh at in this episode.
   For the first 2 acts, I did not let out more than a brief giggle.
   It's not that the story was all that bad.  I think it actually flowed
   rather well.  It's just that the Simpsons is supposed to be comedy,
   and there was none in this pathetic excercise.  In the third act, it
   picked up a bit, with three notable lines: "this just in: Go to
   hell!", "I would assume she would have died from grief" and "that
   cactus is right"  But other than that, I just stared at the screen,
   wanting to cry out in rage.  "The Great White Hype" was better than
   this.  And the ending was the most predictable I've ever seen.  My
   God!  It just was awful through and through.  Why can't there be any
   consistant quality in the show anymore?  Are the writers this bad?
   (D)

William Jones: Although I didn't much care for the last episode, I like
   that the writers are going in the direction of bizarre, implausible
   plots.  This show has been on the air a LONG time, and this is a way
   to keep from getting in a typical sitcom plot rut.  I know that most
   people disagree with me, but I like these wacky situations (Homer
   hallucinates an entire episode after eating hot chili?  Hell yes!)
   (B+)

Matthew Kurth: There's very little to say about this episode at all,
   aside from the fact that it's riddled with continuity errors. Janey's
   voice is wrong.  Homer's age is _35_, not 38.  Homer's dealing with
   Bart's getting beaten up is COMPLETELY inconsistent with "Bart The
   General".  And Moe has SO had a woman in his establishment since
   1979.  Furthermore, I don't believe that's even the real Drederick
   Tatum.
      This episode is quite frankly the biggest piece of sh*t I've ever
   seen dubbed as a Simpsons episode.  Even "Lisa The Vegetarian" had
   the pro-meat movie, even "The PTA Disbands" was at least engaging. No
   comedy, no pathos, no continuity, nothing.  The first time I've ever
   chose to ignore the show and do something else instead.  (D-)

Ricardo Lafaurie: This episode seemed more to be in the style of the
   Fifth Season than anything else.  There were lots of good jokes about
   Tyson and Don King, and others besides it... but I missed most of the
   boxing movie refs, not having seen many.  Overall, it seemed to be
   yet another "glimpse of fame for a Simpson family member" episode.
   The still shots of nice Moe left me with a mixed feeling.  (C+)

Ondre Lombard: Yet another far-fetched idea hatched from writers who
   probably never watched any classic episodes of The Simpsons.  This
   episode is laced with embarrassing continuity errors, uneven
   dialogue, and mostly flat jokes.  Unlike most classic episodes, this
   one's build-up was hardly funny, and what it builds up to isn't even
   that great.  It's also nice to know (not) that the writers are so
   lazy that they have to borrow from not-so-older scripts.  This one
   looks exactly like Homerpalooza except he's boxing instead of taking
   in cannonballs, and even that episode was done far better than this
   one.  (D+)

Robert Merritt: Goodness this episode was horrorable. This was the first
   episode since the George Bush show that I actually thought about
   turning off before it ended. However the George Bush show atlest
   ended on an up note wither Ford. 4F03 died and didn't come back. I
   should have turned it off. Its a real shame considering how good "You
   Only Move Twice" was. I will say this in its defense. I have never
   followed Boxing and pretty much dislike the concept of the sport. So
   maybe I just didn't get the jokes. The Star Trek joke saved it from
   the dreaded E rating.  (D-)

Keith Palmer: This episode landed several good blows when satirising
   boxing and just being strange, even though it depended heavily on a
   strange premise and focused on Moe.  I definitely wasn't moved, but I
   was entertained.  (A-)

Damian Penny: An average episode, with enough jabs at the pro boxing
   world (admittedly, an easy target) to make it worthwhile.  But what
   is with all these large-scale, earth-shattering plots lately (Homer
   getting caught up with a James Bond villain, and now in a
   championship title fight)?  (B)

Jeff Reis: Well, after being pretty damn harsh on last week's show and
   the newer eps in general, I was happy to see tonight's show. Sure,
   the plot was another *really* far-fetched one, but it was funny
   enough to overlook it, unlike last week. The whole "Bonanza" scene
   was hilarious. In fact the whole episode was peppered with genuine
   laughs, and more importantly had almost none of the stilted, forced
   jokes and situations which have marred several episodes over the past
   two seasons. The Don King character was not nearly overblown or funny
   enough, however, and there were some slow spots. It may not have been
   laugh-a-second, but laugh-a-minute is an impressive enough figure for
   me to give it a B+. It had a nice, old-school Simpsons kinda feel for
   the most part.  (B+)

Matt Rose: My favorite one this year so far. I laughed the most of any
   episode so far this season. There haven't been too many episodes
   about Moe, so it was somewhat refreshing. Another good plot this
   week. My complaint the last couple episodes was that there weren't a
   lot of jokes and this episode stepped it up a bit. I liked the ending
   with the whole Peter McNeely type of deal where the manager comes to
   the rescue. I wasn't sure how they'd end it since they really
   couldn't make Homer win or lose, and they didn't have Homer wuss out
   like "Homerpalooza". Good episode.  (B+)

Vishal Sharma: This was the second episode I've watched of season
   eight's The Simpsons, and I'm rapidly wondering why I bother to tune
   in. Sure, there were some nice gags (appearance of Don King made me
   sport a very big smile) but where was the LOL-type humour? It could
   have been a very good episode (Homer becoming a boxer!) but it fell
   flat due to its lack of unique humour.  (D)

Robert Yantosca: The writers seem to be doing a lot of real-world
   parodies these days. Last season they spoofed Michael Jackson's sham
   marriage, and now they're going after the Tyson-McNeely fight.
   Overall a very good show, with a lot of great refs.  I thought that
   the belt scene was great, as were the refs to Raging Bull.  Also
   great was the whole thing with Tatum and his manager parodying Tyson
   getting out of jail and coming back to the ring.  But I thought that
   the fight scene w/ Tatum was  unnecessarily drawn out, and that there
   could have been maybe an apropos I&S cartoon thrown in just for
   kicks.  (B+)

Yours truly: There is not much for me to add that hasn't been already
   said. There were many great gags included in this episode,
   particularly the brilliant b/w ascension to the top, which makes it
   an enjoyable episode for any casual viewer. Unfortunately, some flat
   dumb jokes (Barney drinking varnish), an enormous amount of
   continuity errors and that feeling of "deja vu" with Homerpalooza
   come as a burden for the hard-core Simpsons fan. Maybe if I had felt
   somewhat torn apart by Moe's dilemma...  (C+)


AVERAGE GRADE:  C+ (2.18)

NIELSON RATING:  10.0  (ranked 30th out of 113)  {ol}

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> A Bonanza of TV Fun

Benjamin Jay Robinson: "Bonanza" was one of the country's most popular
   television shows during the sixties.  It followed the exploits of the
   Cartwright family, who had a ranch that seemed only marginally
   smaller than Texas itself.  The mall show mimicked the way the
   television show opened.  A map showed the Cartwright land holdings.
   Suddenly, a small flame burst through the center of the map and
   burned toward the edges of the screen.  In the hole the fire left
   behind, the viewer could see Bart Simpson writing a clever phrase on
   the chalk -- oops, I mean, the viewer would see the Cartwrights
   riding along on horseback.  If you want to see this for yourself, you
   might still be able to -- "Bonanza" is in syndication in several
   markets nationwide.

Mark Aaron Richey:  One of the most popular western series of all time
   (and one of the first in color), this told the saga of the all-male
   Cartwright clan, who lived on the Ponderosa Ranch out west somewhere
   in the late 1800's.  As the Indians said, pretty much the entire cast
   (including Michael Landon) has died.


>> The Life of Dreaderick Tatum

Dave Hall puts together a small biography of Tatum:

    Dreaderick Tatum, the heavyweight champion, grew up in Springfield.
    He learned how to fight in the notorious projects of Capital City,
    and honed his skills while serving time for aggravated assault and
    manslaughter in Springfield Prison. [7F13]

    (In interviews, Tatum has stated to have fathered several children
    with different mothers. [7F13])

    Having served his time, Tatum went on to the 1984 Olympics where he
    won a medal by punching out a Swede three times smaller than his
    size. [9F08]

    In the fight promoted as `The Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out',
    Tatum challenged and won the heavyweight title from Watson. [7F13]
    (He earlier dedicated the fight to the memory of Watson's decease
    manager.)

    As the new heavyweight champion, Tatum went on to better things,
    like moving out of Springfield. As he once told Kent Brockman in a
    candid interview: ``that town is a dump. If you ever see me back
    there, you'll know I really *bleep* up bad.'' [8F08]

    Of Tatum's guest appearances, we only know that he was the Token
    black panellist on the Miss American Girl Pageant. [8F18]


>> Summing Up Mike Tyson in 89 Seconds

Jason Hancock: The similarities between Drederick Tatum and Mike Tyson
   were dead-on.  For those who don't remember, Tyson was convicted of
   raping a Miss Black America contestant in Indiana back in 1992; he
   would serve three years in prison.  In his first fight since being
   released, Tyson disposed of a white tomato can named Peter McNeeley
   -- who may be better known for his post-fight endorsements with AOL
   and Pizza Hut than the fight itself -- in 89 seconds.

Benjamin Jay Robinson: Tyson is one of the modern era's most feared
   prizefighters.  He was incredibly efficient at dispatching opponents;
   one fight lasted about thirty seconds.  (This is what Sweet was
   referring to when he mentioned fans tiring of bouts that ended before
   they got drunk.)  Like Tatum, Tyson has gotten into scrapes with the
   law.  Several years ago, he was convicted of raping a young woman
   named Desiree Washington.  Tyson was recently released, and looked
   little the worse for the wear.  That is, until his fight with Evander
   Holyfield, which Tyson lost in the eleventh round. Interestingly,
   that fight took place the day before "The Homer they Fall" aired.


>> The Don King in All of Us

Benjamin Jay Robinson: As Homer considerately pointed out for us, Lucius
   Sweet is a lot like real-live boxing promoter/manager Don King --
   right down to the electrifried hairstyle.  King has a reputation for
   being almost as ruthless as the boxers he promotes.  He'd probably
   set his mother up to fight if he could make some money from it.
   Fortunately for her, he doesn't have to; King manages the hugely
   successful Mike Tyson.

Brad Barth: Considering the resemblence, it may have been Lucius Sweet
   that appeared at Krusty's funeral back in "Bart the Fink," rather
   than Don King?


>> Fans of the Fan Man

Jason Hancock: The "Fan Man," who's real name is James Miller, made a
   name for himself in November 1993 when he parachuted into the Riddick
   Bowe-Evander Holyfield fight at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.  He was
   fined, served a brief prison sentence, and banned from said venue as
   a result of this, but that did not prevent him from landing atop
   London's Buckingham Palace in February 1994 with similar
   consequences.


>> The Voices Behind those Faces

   - Paul Winfield

Dale G. Abersold: You might remember respected black actor Paul Winfield
   from such films as "Sounder" (for which he received an Oscar
   Nomination), or such TV Series as "The Charmings" (in which he played
   the mirror).  Well, you probably don't remember "The Charmings."  He
   is in the forthcoming "Mars Attacks!" as well as numerous "B" movies
   and made-for-TV productions.  IMHO, he was terrific as the flamboyant
   Don-King-inspired Lucius Sweet.

Michael Ferguson:  Paul Winfield also played as Don King in the HBO
   movie "Tyson", which I thought was the best thing about him being Don
   King's voice in this episode; the writers did their research.

   - Michael Buffer

Dale G. Abersold: Michael Buffer is a boxing ring announcer with the
   well-known catchphrase, "Let's Get Ready to RRRRRUMMMMBLLLLLLE!" This
   phrase was partially referenced in last season's "Homer the Smithers"
   [3F14].


>> The Moderately Average Yellow Hype

Don Del Grande: Presumably, this was not a title fight, since Homer
   would have to be in an organization's Top 10 challengers for them to
   give Homer a title shot (then again, considering the politics in
   boxing, that's not out of the question).

Benjamin Jay Robinson: Wouldn't it have made more sense for Homer to go
   into pro wrestling? Homer's a big fan, and this ability to take
   punishment would serve him well in the wrestling arena.  I've also
   seen some wrestlers who look as, ahem, portly as Homer.  Plus, the
   world of wrestling is a natural for comedy.  Oh, well, mine is not to
   reason why...


>> We must call the nine hundred and eleven!

Mark Aaron Richey: The "Call Police" sign is a take-off on the back of
   car sunshields that swept the country a few years back.  The theory
   was, if you had car trouble, you could pull over on the side of the
   road, slap that baby up in your windshield, and sooner or later,
   someone would call the police for you.  When you didn't need help,
   you would put the other side up. Of course, almost everybody put the
   wrong side out when they parked, or at least they did in the Dallas
   suburb where I grew up.


>> I Was Unaware! I Was Un-A-Ware!

Mark Aaron Richey: About three years ago, police uncovered an extensive
   prostitution ring serving many top actors and studio executives, run
   by Heidi Fleiss.  Even though there was supposedly much sweating
   about who exactly was in Fleiss's little black book, only one name
   ended up coming out (see below).  BTW, Fleiss's father delivered
   Madonna's baby.


>> Charlie Sheen

Mark Aaron Richey: A semi-famous actor who usually ends up starring in
   semi-major movies (like this summer's quickly forgotten alien
   invasion thriller "The Arrival", which departed just in time for
   "Independence Day").  He actually landed in the starring roles of
   some major films in the late 80's (like "Platoon" and "Wall Street"),
   but not anymore.  His name was the only one to emerge from the Heidi
   Fleiss scandal (see above).  Lucky him.


>> Native Americans Like You and Me

Ricardo Lafaurie: Noticed how African-Americans have seldom played
   anyone other than themselves on "The Simpsons"?  (Sounds quite
   collegiate.)  Here are the occassions in which they did:

   7G06,2F32: Ron Taylor as Bleeding Gums Murphy
   7F04,2F03: James Earl Jones as Maggie, Serak the preparer, the moving
              man, and the faceless narrator (that could have been
              himself)
        7F24: Michael Jackson, a black man, plays Leon Kompowski, a
              white man who thinks he's a black man... 
   9F09,1F10: Michael Carrington, a black writer, voices
        4F03: Paul Winfield as Lucius Sweet


>> We make time to acknowledge the hard work of everyone who makes "The
   Simpsons" possible...

Dave Hall: I have noticed some staff changes in the credits for 4F03...

   - Al Jean & Mike Reiss names are not listed at all in any of the
     credits.
   - Is "Animation Producers" a new title credit? (Bill Schultz and
     Michael Wolf are listed as such.)
   - Executive Story Editor: Donick Cary
     (I think the only time they ever list this title is when they
     bring-in "new people take over the "Story Editors" positions.)
   - Story Editors: Dan Greaney, Ron Hauge and Ned Goldreyer
     (formerly Richard Appel and Jennifer Crittenden)
   - The screen listing the assistants to the producers does not have an
     entry for David Mirkin.


>> People Who Need Lyrics

   Here are the lyrics for "People Who Need People"; captioning is
   provided between brackets if different.

         People,
         People who need people
         Are he luckiest people in the world.
         We're one person,                     [We're children,]

>> Simpsons on Sky with outtakes

James R. Curry: The openening title sequence is completely missing from
   the SKY version of this episode.  The line "Okey-doke.  Future's down
   the crapper.  Gotcha." is cut down to "Okey-doke." in the SKY
   version.


>> Those Immortal Threads

   - Where is Springfield?

   A state founded by circus freaks.  {hl}


>> Loose Ends

Bob Wells: In the series of clips of Homer knocking out the palookas,
   when he knocks one guy out of the ring it is a dead ringer for the
   famous photo of Louis Firpo knocking Jack Dempsey out of the ring in
   1923.

Haynes Lee: One of Homer's nicknames "Brick Hithouse" which bring up
   imagery of an outhouse .

Don Del Grande: Homer is getting older despite his kids staying the same
   ages, yet if Homer is 38, he would have been 16 when he graduated
   high school in 1974.

Kearney: Hey, dude, he's ragging on your cord.
  Jimbo: Get him!
-- Never joke about the cord, "The Homer They Fall"

% The bullies jump at Bart, who breaks away and starts running down the
% hall. Water-drinking Janey exclaims "No running!"  Jimbo, Kearney and
% Dolph continue to chase Bart.  "Time for a little evasive action,"
% panics Bart as he pushes the button that "indicates" that he's turning
% left.  He runs a little towards the left hall, then runs right.  He
% throws off his hunters for a while, then presses the "Help" button on
% his belt, which starts a voice that incessantly cries "Help, help,
% help..."  Bart's immediately spotted.

Bart: I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but... you guys asked for
      it.  [pushes the "Emergency Use Only" button]
       [a small parachute emerges, carrying a "Call police" sign]
      Can't you read?!  Call the police!
       [the bullies beat him]
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Bart returns home with bruises, a black eye and his shirt torn up.  He
% passes pie-eating Homer.

 Bart: [all bruised up]  Hey, dad.
Homer: Looking good, son.  [stops Bart]  Hey!  What happened to your
       belt?
-- The caringest father in the world, "The Homer They Fall"

% Bart explains.

      Homer: Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand:
             squealing. You've got to squeal to every teacher and every
             grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start.
       Bart: But then they'll just beat me up even worse!
      Homer: Yes, they are a clever bunch.  I know.  I'll squeal for
             ya... to their parents!
              [later that day...]
Jimbo's dad: [punches him in the face]  That's for telling me how to
             raise my lousy kid!
Dolph's dad: [punches him in the gut]  This is for the crummy life I've
             had to live!
-- Oh, this is a good idea, "The Homer They Fall"

% Homer seems impervious to the punches, and continues his attempt to
% reason with the angry fathers, who continue to beat on him.  "Hey!
% Something's wrong with this guy!  He's not falling down!" whines
% Kearney's dad.
%
% Moe points a gun to them.

Fun's over, fellas!  If you're gonna beat up _my_ friend in _my_ bar,
there's a two-drink minimum.
-- Moe's most sacred rule, "The Homer They Fall"

% The men slowly back away out of Moe's.  Moe tends to Homer's injury.

  Moe: Geez, Homer.  I never seen a guy stand up to that kind of
       punishment. I mean, you took a three-man pounding and didn't even
       fall down.
Homer: Big deal.  I didn't even get my kid's belt back.  The only thing
       a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
  Moe: There you go!  That's the spirit!  Homer, I've seen prizefighters
       couldn't take a punch half as good as you.  You know, boxing
       might be right up your alley.
Homer: Really?
  Moe: Oh please!  It's the good life, Homer.  Some of these boxers,
       they eat steak _and_ lobster _and_ salad bar all in a single
       meal.
Homer: [gasps]  Dressing...?
  Moe: Their choice.
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Moe puts Homer to the test:

  Moe: Are you man enough to test every one of your limits?
Homer: Yes.
  Moe: And are you man enough to throw a punch should the opportunity
       arise?
Homer: Yes!
  Moe: And are you man enough to give me a sixty percent cut?
Homer: YES!
  Moe: I'll take it.
Homer: Woo-hoo!
        [a boxing bell rings]
-- Let the games begin, "The Homer They Fall"

[End of Act One.  Time: 5:14]

% As a manager, Moe wants Homer to have complete faith in him, and thus
% leads him to...

Wow, I've never been in here before.
-- Homer steps into the ladies' room, "The Homer They Fall"

% Since there haven't been any ladies in Moe's since 1979, Moe turned
% the ladies' room into an office replete with boxing gloves, a desk and
% posters/pictures of Moe as a boxer.

Homer: You used to be a boxer just like me?
  Moe: Yup.  They called me Kid Gorgeous.  Later on, it was Kid
       Presentable. Then Kid Gruesome.  And finally, Kid Moe.
Homer: [raising dirty pail]  Hey, what's this?
  Moe: Ah, that, that's my old spit bucket.  Yeah, I've been meaning to
       empty that out.
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Homer finds a picture of Moe standing beside a big black man in
% glasses with odd, unbrushed hair standing up.

Homer: [gasps]  You know Lucius Sweet?!  He's one of the biggest names
       in boxing! He's exactly as rich and as famous as Don King, and he
       looks just like him, too!
  Moe: Yeah, he was my manager.  Back when I was Gorgeous, everybody
       wanted a piece of me.  But somehow, I just never made it to the
       big time.
Homer: Why not?
  Moe: 'Cause I got knocked out forty times in a row.  That, plus
       politics.  You know, it's all politics.
Homer: [glaring] Lousy democrats.
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% At home, at the breakfast table, the family discusses Homer's latest
% hobby.

Homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in
the middle.
-- Marge comments on Homer's new boxing carreer, "The Homer They Fall"

Marge: Before you even consider this, I insist you consult a doctor.
Homer: No problemo.  [pecks Marge on the cheek and walks off]
Marge: A _competant_ doctor!
Homer: [off-screen]  D'oh!
-- She knows the trick, "The Homer They Fall"

% Dr. Hibbert examines inside of Homer's left ear in the physicals room.

Hibbert: Well, sir, you more than meet every one of this state's
         requirements to box, wrestle or be shot out of a cannon.
  Marge: [growls]  That's what we get for living in a state founded by
         circus freaks.
-- At least he doesn't wrestle bears, "The Homer They Fall"

% Hibbert displays an x-ray of Homer's head.

Hibbert: You have an absolutely unique genetic condition known as "Homer
         Simpson syndrome".
  Homer: [moaning] Oh, why me?
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Hibbert calms his fears: his brain is cushioned by a layer of fluid
% 1/8th of an inch thicker than normal, acting like a football helmet.

Hibbert: Why, I could wallop you all day with this surgical two-by-four
         without ever knocking you down.
          [brandishes stick, then checks his watch]
         But... I have other appointments.
-- To wallop people with Homer Simpson syndrome perhaps?,
      "The Homer They Fall"

% Decked in boxing-trunks, Homer practices with Moe in an abandoned
% ring.

Moe: All right, Homer.  Let's see the left.
      [a fly stops on Moe's right cushion]
      [Homer punches it, yet it flies away intact]
Moe: O-kay...  Let's see the right.
-- Don't hold your breath, "The Homer They Fall"

% Homer is exhausted on the ring boundry, panting.  "Just a second..."
% "When you're ready."  "All right, I'm ready..." Homer begins to get
% up, but falls back again.  "Wait a minute..."  Homer continues to
% pant. "All right.  ...  Wait a minute, just a sec..."

  Moe: Okay, punching isn't your thing.  But that's okay.  You're not
       that kind of fighter.  What you're gonna do is stand there while
       your opponent gets exhausted from over-punching.
Homer: Then I can just push him over.
  Moe: That's right, and if the ref's not looking, you can kick him a
       couple of times.
-- Homer's always been master at dirty fighting, "The Homer They Fall"

% Moe rides a moped as Homer jogs in the street.

  Moe: Who's gonna knock you down?
Homer: No one!
  Moe: When do you gonna fight back?
Homer: Never!
  Moe: What are you gonna do?
Homer: Nothin'!
  Moe: That's my boy!
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% The fight is on at Moe's bar, and the crowd is waiting to see it.

Barney: Man, you'd never get me into a ring.  Boxing causes brain
        damage.
        [drinks varnish]
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Meanwhile, Moe is psyching up Homer in his Ladies' Room office.

  Moe: Okay, you're fighting a guy named Boxcar Bob.
Homer: Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?
  Moe: Uh, no, not yet, he still lives at the trainyard.  But he's a
       hungry young fighter.  In fact, he's actually fighting for a
       sandwich.
-- The glory of boxing, "The Homer They Fall"

% Moe blows dust off of his boxing gloves and gives them to Homer.

  Moe: Homer, I want you to have my lucky mits.  I hope you do better
       with them than I did.
Homer: [donning them]  Gee, thanks, Moe.  What's this?
  Moe: Ah, that's the barbed wire.  We, uh, we called that the stinger.
       They, they don't let you use that no more.
-- But they did then?, "The Homer They Fall"

Now, no matter how much he hits you, you don't do nothing, okay?  You
don't wanna get drawn into a boxing match, here.
-- Moe's idea of managing a boxer, "The Homer They Fall"

% Boxcar Bob discards his coat and travelling stick.  Homer takes twenty
% one quick blows nonchalantly as the crowd cheers on.

Lenny: Man, that tramp's got the energy of a hobo.
 Carl: Yeah, he never stops punching -- except to check out his bindle.
        [Bob indeed checks it after every couple of punches]
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% As time passes, Bob becomes exhausted and can't hit anymore. Moe warns
% Homer that this is the right time; he gently nudges his opponent, who
% tips over, dead tired. The crowd cheers and Moe shares pride with
% Homer.
%
% November 3rd: Homer takes more blows by Boxcar Fred.  Homer is 7th
% place in the semi-pro boxers chart.  Moe counts up more cash, which
% Homer uses on premium wax.  Boxcar Ira is now taken out by Homer.
% Homer has three more boxcar opponents taken out -- and three more
% washes -- until he is moved up to first place.
%
% Moe does business in his office and grabs a cigar from the "For your
% courtesy" dispenser.  He ends up getting a light by a black man in a
% tuxedo decorated with glittering, gaudy jewelry, donning bizzare,
% sticking-up hair.  "Hello, Moe!  Delightful to see you again!"

   Moe: Lucius!  Hey!  What's a glitteradi like you doing in my dump?
        I thought you were managing the champ.
Lucius: Yes, managing Drederick has been my highest priority, even
        though he is temporarily incarcerated for pushing his mother
        down the stairs. But with his inpending release, I've been
        strategizing for his glorious return to the shores of Fistiana.
   Moe: Uh, what?
Lucius: His comeback fight.  You know, boxing?
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Moe pities the man who will donate his body for Tatum's cause, but
% drops his cigar when Lucious mentions Homer. Lucious only needs an
% opponent that will last three rounds -- fans wanting to get drunk
% _before_ the fight is over -- but Moe doubts Homer could stand that
% long. Nevertheless, the taste of glory and success is tempting...
%
% That night, Homer and Moe are sat in lawnchairs atop the roof of Moe's
% Tavern with two beers in hand.

  Moe: I gotta be honest with you, Homer.  I didn't bring you up here to
       show you my new tar paper.
Homer: You didn't?
  Moe: No.  Homer, how would you like to be heavyweight champion of the
       world?
Homer: Oh, sure.
-- Casual talk, "The Homer They Fall"

  Moe: All you gotta do is fight Drederick Tatum.  It's this Saturday.
       Here's your parking pass.
Homer: [reading the pass]  Ooh, "general."
-- All the privileges, "The Homer They Fall"

% Homer doesn't have a clue about who Tatum is, but trusts Moe on that
% point.
%
% Not too far away, inside the Springfield Penitentiary, chaos and
% anarchy is abound.  "Hey, come on guys, shut up," demands a large,
% goteed black man eating brussels sprouts in his jail cell.  It's
% Drederick.  In a heartbeat, the chaos ends, and guards step back as
% prisoners return to their cells in silence.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 12:21]
%
% Tatum's at a desk, with Lucius Sweet beside him.  Both are in front of
% a mob of interviewers.

Man #1: Champ, do you feel remorse for your crime?
 Tatum: Oh, yes.  Believe me, my god, if I could turn back the clock on
        my mother's stair-pushing, I would certainly... reconsider it.
Man #2: Drederick, ah, what do you think of Homer Simpson?
 Tatum: I think he's a good man.  I like him.  I got nothing against
        him, but I'm definately gonna make orphans of his children.
Man #3: Uh, you know, they _do_ have a mother, Champ.
 Tatum: Yes, but I would imagine that she would die of grief.
         [interviewers continue to battle to get their questions in]
Lucius: Thank you, thank you.  But the champ has no time for further
        queries.  This parole hearing is over.
         [audience/hearers groan]
Man #4: I wanted to know what it was like in prison...
-- The law meets the National Enquirer, "The Homer They Fall"

% Back at the family's breakfast table, Homer has some coffee while
% Marge finds out about the fight reading the newspaper.

Marge: Homer, why are they saying you're going to fight Drederick Tatum?
Homer: [gulps]  Uh, well, uh, I was gonna surprise you, but... happy
       anniversary, baby!
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Marge is upset, but Homer argues his point.

Homer: I'll make a fortune for one night's work!  We can have all the
       things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted carports,
       those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes...
Marge: But you'll get killed!
Homer: Marge!  Will you let me finish?  Plug-In room deodorizers, front
       _and_ rear spoilers for the car.
-- And just enough for the coffin, "The Homer They Fall"

 Lisa: Mom's right, Dad.  The odds against you winning are a thousand to
       one.
Homer: Whoa, I don't think it's _that_ unlikely.
 Lisa: Those are the odds they're giving in Vegas.
Homer: All right, I think we've heard just about enough from Mr.
       Newspaper today.  [tosses the newspaper outside]
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Later that day, Bart and Grampa are watching an ad for Homer's match.

             [on TV, a monstrously strong Drederick Tatum exits a jail
             cell threateningly]
 Announcer: Society put away Drederick Tatum for his brutal crime.  But
            he's paid his debt, and now, he's going to get revenge... on
            Homer Simpson.
             [a shot of Homer, staring blankly, and getting powerfully

             PAYBACK"]
Abe & Bart: Yay!
      Bart: Woo hoo!
       Abe: [to Maggie] That's your daddy.
-- Correction: former daddy, "The Homer They Fall"

% The fight is now on at the Springfield Coliseum.  Lined up fans,
% according to coliseum requirements, are dressed tackily.  Meanwhile, a
% t-shirt peddler is about wearing one, and holding up a t-shirt with a
% picture of a boxing glove headed for Homer's face.  "T-shirts!  Get
% your t-shir-r-rts.  Tell 'em where you've been by wearing a t-shirt!"
%
% Meanwhile, in the locker room, Bart is helping Homer prepare.

You'll be okay, Dad.  Just make sure he hits you an _even_ number of
times, so you don't end up with amnesia.
-- Bart tips his father, "The Homer They Fall"

% Elsewhere, in the locker hall, Moe paces nervously in front of an
% ashtray with several cigarette butts in them and scattered around the
% tray on the floor. Moe butts out another cigarette then lights up
% another.  Just then, Marge goes to see him.

Marge: Moe, I'm so glad I found you.  Please, promise me you won't let
       Homer get hurt.
  Moe: Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the villain here, okay?  If Homer gets
       killed in the ring tonight, it'll be because of your negative
       attitude -- there, I said it.
-- And let's not forget all those feminine undergarments...,
      "The Homer They Fall"

% Marge doesn't fold in, and asks Moe to throw in his towel and stop the
% fight the instant Homer is in danger; annoyed, Moe promises. However,
% after Marge has left, he reconsiders and throws his towel in the trash
% can.
%
% Lights are everywhere in the arena, with the crowds full.  Ring
% announcer Michael Buffer introduces the fight.

Buffer: Celebrities at ringside tonight:

        Hollywood prostitution scandal: Rainer-r-r Wolfcastle!
         [applause]
        TV anchorman and Springfield institution, Mr. Kent Brockman!
         [Kent waves, and the audience boos and throws litter at him]
  Kent: [sarcastic laugh]  This just in, go to hell!
Buffer: From the world of organized crime, say hello to Anthony "Fat
        Tony" D'Amico!
         [applause]
-- Typical ringside, "The Homer They Fall"

The ruiner of events worldwide -- title fights, the Super Bowl, and the
Nixon funeral; ladies and gentlemen, the Fan Man!
-- Book him for your own funerals right now, "The Homer They Fall"

% The Fan Man, dressed in a red jumpsuit and helmet, parachutes into the
% audience with a propeller on his back, which shaves off Krusty's
% rightside of hair.  "Oh cripes!  Now I gotta comb this side over." he
% complains.
%
% Behind the doors of the walkway, Moe has a last chat with Homer.

      Moe: All right, Homer, I'm not gonna lie to you.  There's a good
           chance you can beat Tatum.  But you gotta visualize how
           you're gonna win, okay?
    Homer: Gotcha.
           [dreams on about his victory]
Announcer: A congenital heart defect has apparently felled Tatum moments
           before he could step into the ring.
-- You wish, Homer, "The Homer They Fall"

% Buffer introduces, "back into decent society", the heavyweight
% Champion of the world, Drederick Tatum. The audience cheers as
% Drederick Tatum, not fooling around, walks down the walkway with his
% assistants as hip-hop rap music plays behind him.  Tatum enters the
% boxing ring, prepares a little and shows off his "Mr. Armageddon"
% robe.

To challenge the irresistable force of Tatum, we have the immoveable
object; he's been called the Brickhead House and is also known as the
Southern Dandy, Homer-r-r Simpson!
-- Who's gonna bleep me now?, "The Homer They Fall"

% Homer walks down the opposite runway with "Why Can't We Be Friends?"
% as his theme song, with Abe and Moe on his side.  Homer has to be
% pushed into the ring by Moe and Abe.  Lucius walks up to Moe.

Lucius: Your boy looks a little soft, Moe.  You do remember our
        arrangement?
   Moe: Yeah, don't worry, you'll get your three rounds.
Lucius: Stupendous.  Because if he goes down before that bell rings,
        your future's going with him.
   Moe: Okey-doke.  Future's down the crapper.  Gotcha.
-- What difference will it make?, "The Homer They Fall"

Due to popular demand, we will forgo our national anthem.
-- Micheal Buffer starts the fight, "The Homer They Fall"

% The bell goes off and Tatum and Homer face each other.

Homer: Okay, Homer, nothing to be worried about.  Just... [gets punched]
       OOF!
        [way back in Row ZZ, Bart and Lisa watch]
 Bart: Wow!  I've never seen Dad hit somebody like _that_ before!

 Bart: Isn't Dad the one in the black trunks?
 Lisa: No!
 Bart: Uh-oh.
Marge: [from behind the pillar with Maggie]  What?  What?  What am I
       missing?  What?
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% "And there's Tatum, showboating for the crowd!" says Michael Buffer as
% Tatum pounds Homer silly.  Only six seconds have passed.  Moe tries to
% motivate his champ.
%
% Showing disdain towards Homer, Tatum takes a break to talk cooking
% with Charlie Sheen. The referee directs Tatum back to the fight, and
% he picks up where he left off beating on Homer.  A tall mass of curly
% blue hair moves through the audience.  Homer's vision is clouded now.

Marge: [through Homer's fuzzy vision]  Homer!  Homer, he's not going to
       get tired.  You've got to hit him back.  Hit him back!
Homer: That cactus is right.
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Homer realizes his only chance is to knock Tatum out. He winds up,
% takes his best shot ever... and misses.  Tatum returns Homer's failed
% punch and hits him directly in the head.  Homer's now on his last leg.

Moe: Hang in there, Homer!  Only four hundred and forty more seconds.
     [to Abe]  He's getting his second win.
Abe: No!  He's getting killed!
-- Bah, either way is good, "The Homer They Fall"

% Moe can't bear to watch, and runs away through the cheering crowd.
%
% Krusty, Frink, Patty, Selma, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Lucius and Kent are
% at the apex of excitement, helping the audience cheer on.

      Marge: Somebody stop the fight!  Where's the doctor?!
              [guess who's the fight doctor?]
Dr. Riviera: Kill him!  Kill him!
-- Where's that competent doctor when you need him?,
      "The Homer They Fall"

% Tatum steps back and builds up what will be the final punch. Homer's
% family watch, nervously, as Tatum swings his fist slowly towards
% Homer. At the very last minute, Homer is picked up and rescued by Moe,
% donning the Fanman's propeller.

Oh my god!  Simpson's manager has flown into the ring and is airlifting
him out!  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever dignity remained in boxing is
literally flying out the window.
-- "The Homer They Fall"

Homer: [slurred] Are you an angel?
  Moe: Yes, Homer.  I'm an angel.  All us angels wear farah slacks.
Homer: But you stopped the fight.  Won't everyone be mad at you?
  Moe: Eh, let 'em be mad.  The only thing that matters to me is you're
       safe.
        [bumps Homer's head up a steel beam]
Homer: D'oh!
  Moe: Sorry.
-- Angelic goofs, "The Homer They Fall"

% Moe flies Homer out the ceiling window of the coliseum and lands him
% outside to safety in front of a huge crowd.

 Tatum: Homer, your manager obviously loves you very much.
        Lucius, would you do that for me?
Lucius: Absolutely, I would.  [chuckles]  Now get in the van.
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Tatum walks away.

Lucius: You couldn't even give me one lousy round, Moe.  You will always
        be a loser.  Now take your check for a hundred thousand dollars
        and get out of my sight.
   Moe: I don't need your stinking money!
         [carefully folds the check and puts it in his pocket]
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% The family gathers around Homer.

Marge: Oh, Homie!  Are you okay?
Homer: [in pain and sorrow] I can't remember where we parked.
Marge: That's all right.  We'll just wait till everyone else leaves.
 Bart: I got your tooth, Dad.
        [tries to fit it in his mouth]
Homer: Uh, not mine.
        [tosses tooth aside]
-- "The Homer They Fall"

% Moe pulls the cord that starts his propeller and flies away, going
% "nowheres in particular", in need for time to think. An angry Fanman
% chases him down on the ground, yelling at him for his equipment.

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 22:19]
