       !    appears in the cage with his head detached.

       !       That was really nasty cutting out that Hutz scene from [1F04]
       !    where he defended Homer when he sold his soul for a donut. From
       !    the original episode it looked like Hutz snuck out the bathroom

       !    that Hutz snuck out to get the pizza when he realized that he
       !    could win the case in less than 30 minutes. Now that's
       !    professionalism!

%  That night, Homer is still trapped under the trampoline.  A wolf howls in
%  the background.  "I'm thirsty," Homer whines, but just then, the cliff
%  finally breaks off, and Homer falls with a yell.
%
%  Homer's next plan is to use a buzzsaw to slice the trampoline to
%  pieces.  "Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline," he announces, and runs towards
%  it, screaming maniacally while the buzzsaw whirls.  Unfortunately, his
%  extension cord isn't quite long enough, and the cord snaps taut
%  suddenly, spilling Homer onto his back and causing him to throw the
%  buzzsaw into the air.  The saw lands on the trampoline and wraps the
%  cord rapidly around the trampoline in loops.  Marge and Maggie watch
%  as a big chuck of the kitchen wall is torn loose where the extension
%  cord was plugged in.
%
%  Homer: All right, all right...you win for now.  But someday you'll _rust_!

%  Bart walks over to where Homer laughs.
