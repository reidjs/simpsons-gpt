==============================================================================
Couch      :- OFF sits on the couch, which is a mostly clever and
              detailed parody of The Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
              Hearts Club Band" album cover.  [Recycled from 4F06]

       and Lisa? (What, the only kids that were in the mall that day all
       happened to be in Bart's or Lisa's class at school?)
   ... Krusty has a "Kroon Along With Krusty" gold record?
   ... the poster behind Krusty says "The Krusty Show - Weekdays at
       4:00" and the drum on it says "The Krusty the Klown Show", but
       the banner in the studio says "Krusty The Clown"?
   ... at the dinner table scene, somebody remembered that Lisa is a
       vegetarian?

       since 4F06, which was when they first used 4F12's couch scene?

Sean J. O'Neal:
   ... Homer seems a little cruel to the computer nerds who saved him in
       "Homer Goes to College"?

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Hmm.  I guess the writers read this newsgroup after
   all, eh?  Actually, this was still quite a strong episode, and the
   numerous animation in-jokes were the icing on the cake.  And it's
   always worthwhile to hear from Roger Meyers, Jr.  (A)

Greg Bigoni:  I think that the a.t.s. lurkers who were offended by this
   episode were the ones that most deserved to be offended by it. The
   rest of us, myself included, got a good laugh out of it. It's a good
   feeling to know that I'm not the only person getting tired of these
   pathetic freaks who post "Worst Episode Ever" reviews every other
   week. Unfortunately, the a.t.s. satire overshadowed the plot, which
   wasn't one of the show's best... I don't think Krusty has ever been
   so unfunny before. Still, I thought the way that the writers disposed
   of Poochie was hilarious.  (B-)

Jennifer M. Blaske:  I laughed so hard at a couple of spots that I had
   to hit the Pause button! But at the same time, I was thinking, "Boy,
   the people that thought "Bart Gets Famous" was self-indulgent are
   gonna *hate* this." I may be off-base, but as I was watching it I
   thought they were making fun of themselves as much as us. I hope that
   is true ... If it weren't for the fans they'd have no jobs, so making
   a whole episode to tell us off would be pretty inappropriate, IMO.
   (B+)

Steve Frayne:  The first time I watched this episode I was disgusted
   with it for its lack of direction with the plot and lack of typical
   humor coupled with the overall crumminess of poochie.  However this
   one grew on me quickly in a similar fashion and for much the same
   reasons as did 3F16.  To me the two episodes are very similar and
   both are very entertaining for the underlying point they individually
   make.  This one managed to take the many criticisms, strengths, and
   trends that have developed before our eyes and mirror them in the
   Itchy & Scratchy show.  Clearly this episode can't be judged well on
   the usual set of standards, but it has its more subtle merits which
   can't be overlooked.  (B)

Jonathan S. Haas:  Well, there was an episode directly at us, the
   hardcore fans, and frankly, it stung. Because I fear that the
   portrayal of the fans in this episode was a little too on-target.
   Maybe we're a bit too much like the guys at the autographing session.
   And, well, here I am on the Internet within minutes, registering my
   opinion throughout the world.
      And they're absolutely right. They don't owe us a darnded thing.
   They've given us hundreds of hours of entertainment for free, and if
   anything, we owe them.
      A lot of people have lately talked about the "decline" of the
   Simpsons, and most people agree that the older episodes were better
   than the new ones. But maybe the show hasn't changed... maybe it's as
   good as ever, but after so many years, the characters can't have the
   same impact they once had. The writers put their answers to us, the
   fans, in the mouths of Bart and Lisa.
      A good episode that wouldn't be nearly as relevant to viewers
   unfamiliar with the fan community. Grade: A, because the writers
   would mock me if I gave it anything else.

Jason Hancock:  I thought this was a pretty good episode.  Alex Rocco
   turned in another good performance as Roger Meyers, and the writers
   threw a lot of meta-humor and self-refs -- plus a long-overdue slam
   at people who criticize the show.  The only problem I had was with
   Roy, who seemed to be thrown in.  (B+)

Ryan Johnson:  While this episode seemed much more down to earth than
   ussual (a plus for me), it wasn't all that funny.  I didn't find all
   the references to a.t.s. bashing the show all that funny, probably
   because they went on for so long.  Why do I get the feeling that Roy
   will be back to visit us just as Cletus and Disco Stu have?  This
   type of gag has become self mockery, not meta-humor.  (C+)

Margaret H. Jones:  Either the writers are trying too hard, or they just
   don't give a damn anymore.  This episode was utterly predictable and
   not funny.  I wouldn't call it the worst episode; I would rather see
   it than Bart Gets an Elephant. Still, the idea of having a "cool" dog
   with Homer's voice is just absurd.  (D)

Diego Kontarovsky:  A good episode, but a lousy ending. The cruelty of
   the network reminded me of the scene from episode #1F11, Bart Gets
   Famous, when Bart says, "Boy. Show business is kind of cruel, isn't
   it?" right before Krusty slams the door in his face. Overall, the
   scene where Homer talks to his brain after the Poochie premiere went
   kind of slow, and there was very little action, but a good episode.
   Loved the newsgroup reference.  (B+)

Ondre Lombard:  No plot, full-fledged unpressidented attacks at people
   who rightfully observe The Simpsons' decline (the producers need to
   sit down and watch Homer's Odyssey, compare it to The Homer They
   Fall, compare Lisa's Substitute with The PTA Disbands and get a clue
   instead of just ranting and raving about us fans).  The jokes clearly
   prove the writers can't differenciate those who are annoyed with
   minor details, like animation flaws from those who notice a decline
   in the feel of the show in _general_, especially including the
   characters.  The episode was an outrage.  It was very inconsiderate
   to the fans who aren't even on the internet.  If you stripped it of
   its bitter flames, it would be an empty 10 minutes of nothingness. As
   Comic Book Guy said "One of the worst ever."  (C)

Blaine Moller:  This episode talks directly to those people that write
   into this page with stupid and irrelevant comments and observations
   like the comments made by the nerds in the picture signing that homer
   had.  The comic store owner perfectly represented some of the people
   that cant wait to get on the internet and degrade the episode that
   they just watched. If you dont quite understand the show and how it
   pokes fun at everything with little regard to continuity you need to
   change the channel.  It's all in good fun, the jokes are the
   important part not wheather a character used a different toothbrush
   last episode or something stupid like that.  Lay off the negativity
   and enjoy the humor.  Classic Simpsons humor, Great episode as usual!
   (A)

Sean J. O'Neal:  I have always loved the way the writers use "Itchy and
   Scratchy" as a catharsis for their own experiences in creating "The
   Simpsons," and this episode is the best possible example of that.
   Finally, they tackle US! The scenes in the comic book store can ONLY
   be fully appreciated by us "hardcore" fans, and that makes this
   episode a delightful combination valentine/kick-in-the-face. (I
   nearly lost it, as I'm sure most of the rest of you did, during the
   "magic xylophone" and "worst episode ever" scenes -- I think this
   finally proves that the writers ARE reading this newsgroup.) I can't
   see how any of us can hate this one -- I mean, it's always nice to
   see yourself on TV. The first classic episode of the season.  (A+)

Nate Patrin:  Whoa! The slams on the more pessimistic and nitpicky of us
   on a.t.s aside, this episode, frankly, rocked. It's a definite "watch
   several times, including with your friends who missed it" ep. Poochie
   was a hilarious parody of the "proactive"- i.e. "EXTREEEEEEME!" crap
   being pushed by marketers (his song was astoundingly bad- and
   hilarious). Roy was a strange addition to the cast (yes, I *DID* get
   the joke), and the ending was a bit rushed, but who cares when we
   have the best Ralph line in ages: "My knob tastes funny..."  (A)

Werner Peeters:  Second A+ for me this season, after The Springfield
   Files. I watched it twice in a row, because there are SO many good
   things about this episode: the meta-references including our beloved
   newsgroup, the Nancy Cartwright-like voice actor for Itchy and
   Scratchy, Homer's 'solutions' to the dropping viewer ratings, the
   psychic tormentation of Milhouse and Ralph crying for his mommy, and
   of course all the diabolical mayhem caused by our favourite cat and
   mouse duo! This was indeed a worthy milestone in the history of the
   Simpsons! And a rightful sneer to all the critic (Worst Episode Ever
   etc.); Lisa's comments about the evolution of Itchy and Scratchy
   throughout the years and the positive message at the end of the
   episode are things every Simpson fan should keep in his heart.  (A+)

Mark Aaron Richey:  Being an A.T.S. regular, I was able to get most of
   the in-jokes directed at us and ourselves (Worst Episode Ever!!!),
   but the rise and fall of Poochie was simply not very compelling
   (though the only Poochie cartoons were brilliant.  The entire third
   act just sat there until the final Poochie cartoon.  Still, it's
   always nice to hear Alex Rocco as Roger Myers, Jr.  BTW, is there
   anybody else who felt, for this record breaking episode, that they
   should have used the Flintstones couch gag (as brilliant at the Sgt.
   Pepper's gag is)?  (B-)

Benjamin J. Robinson:  The alternate title for this episode might be,
   "Revenge of the Writers."  This episode takes a terrific look at the
   often dicey relationship between a show and its viewers.  The
   abundant meta-humor helps make the rise and fall of Poochie solidly
   entertaining.  The Internet fan base should look kindly on this one;
   it's a keeper.  (A)

Matt Rose:  WELL DONE WRITERS! That was a big time slap in the face to
   all the show's "fans" who keep ripping it to shreds. I no have no
   doubt in my mind that they really do read what we are all saying. So
   let me say this: That was brilliant. The best trend I have seen in
   recent episodes is all of the show's references to itself. And this
   entire episode basically was just that. "Don't have a cow Lisa". I
   also love the newsgroup bashing with the "dead/alive" and the
   "realism vs. cartoonish" threads. Clever, clever, clever. And at the
   same time perhaps we see a glimpse of how the show's voice actors are
   treated. This one will be talked about for a long, long time.  (A+)

Aaron Varhola:  I think we can forgive David S. Cohen for writing "Lisa
   the Vegetarian". :)   Sharp satire of the mindlessness of television
   executives (if you want to see a RL battle, look at
   alt.tv.animaniacs, and their loathing of Jamie Kellner for cancelling
   Freakazoid!, Road Rovers, and Earthworm Jim), with a few well-placed
   digs at some of us.  Cohen's strength is in satirical material; an
   excellent example of his oeuvre along with "Much Apu About Nothing".
   (A)

Yours Truly:  My, oh my. When the writers spend a whole episode pointing
   at you, a mere paragraph seems small as a reply. Nonetheless, my
   thoughts could probably be summed up as these few words: "What the
   hell are you trying to say?" Were the writers admitting their faults
   ("It's those lousy writers")? Were they blaming the network for
   sticking its nose in their business ("proactive and paradigm")? Were
   they accusing us of being too "nerdy" ("magic xylophone")? Or were
   they bluntly asking us to shut the hell up ("*you* owe *them*")?
      As a self-referencing episode making fun of itself, this one was
   great, and I laughed my head off. As a message from the writers, I
   was left drifting. I guess your opinion will depend whether you're
   watching the show out of pure fun or sheer criticism. If it's both,
   like me, then the grading is even tougher.  (B)


AVERAGE GRADE:  B (3.15)

NIELSEN RATING: 15.67  (Ranked 17th out of 101)  {ol}

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Long May You Run

Benjamin J. Robinson:  As you might know by now, this is a milestone
   episode.  "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" is the 167th episode
   of "The Simpsons," surpassing the record set by "The Flintstones."
   Actually, "The Simpsons" broke *two* longevity records for cartoons.
   "The Flintstones" aired for about six years (1960 to 1966).  "The
   Simpsons" broke the six-year "time barrier" last season, with "Two
   Bad Neighbors (3F09)."  Back in the old days, however, more episodes
   were made for each season; even though "The Simpsons" ran longer in
   the time sense, the cartoon cave people could still claim more shows.
   Well, until now.


>> Writer Watch
 
Dale G. Abersold:  David S. Cohen began somewhat shakily with the
   "Nightmare Cafeteria" segment of "Treehouse of Horror V" [2F03], and
   the much-hated "Lisa the Vegetarian" [3F03].  The "Homer^3" segment
   of "ToH VI" [3F04] was popular, however, and many have admired "Much
   Apu About Nothing" [3F20] and "Citizen Kang" from "ToH VII" for their
   political satire.  His next project is the "Chief Wiggum, P.I."
   segment of "The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" [4F20].


>> Can you play "When the Saints Go Marching In" on that thing?

Benjamin J. Robinson:  After "The Simpsons" got the go-ahead to become a
   full-fledged series, the writers and producers met to flesh out the
   characters.  At this meeting, it was decided that Lisa would play
   some sort of instrument. As Matt Groening later said, it would be a
   way for her to express what was going on in her soul.  The problem
   was, which instrument?  David Silverman, who was the head honco for
   animation at the time, suggested the same instrument he played -- the
   tuba.  For whatever reason, that didn't fly, and Lisa ended up
   playing the saxophone.

   According to Dave Hall, the animator who draws Poochie resembles Mr.
   Silverman, and sure enough, we see a tuba in the background. Looks
   like someone decided to give his hobby a subtle plug.

   (The above information was drawn from reports of Mr. Silverman's
   first "meet the fans" talk in San Fransisco.)


>> The Writers' Unabridged Who's Who

Bob Beecher:  (Exec. Prod.) "Bill Oakley" was the first to speak at the
   conference table (he was wearing the blue shirt) and seated next to
   him with dark hair, glasses, and a plaid shirt was his partner, Josh
   Weinstein!

   Bill said that he holds the honor of being roughed up by Krusty in a
   later scene.

   George Meyer was the writer wearing the hat who gets fired.

      [Dan Greaney and Ken Keeler were quite active recently, so I'd
      guess those two might just be the other silent writers. Anybody
      knows better? --ed]


Jennifer Hale:  My brother is an entertainment editor at a newspaper and
   he interviewed David S. Cohen in the summer, and when he asked the
   publicity department for a picture of Cohen, they sent the drawing
   instead. If anyone cares, he was the one in the goatee with the squid
   on his shirt who mentioned something about rotisserie chicken.


>> Do the hallways keep repeating themselves?

Roger Smith:  The conference room where the I&S writers meet looks much
   like the room used for the Simpson's table read. The real one has
   cabinets and a TV screen in the wall at one end - but the real one
   doesn't change size like the cartoon one does.

   The hallways and other scenes of the buildings, however, don't look
   much like the Simpsons offices. The Simpsons offices are just behind
   the Fox backlot and are old 1930's or 1940's buildings with very
   narrow, cluttered hallways.


>> The lady of a thousand voices

Aaron Varhola:  Homer's co-star is obviously based on June Foray,
   legendary voice actress best known as the voices of Rocky and Natasha
   in "Rocky and Bullwinkle" [and as Granny in the Sylvester/Tweety
   cartoons --ed], and the first guest voice on The Simpsons, as the
   Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers Babysitting service receptionist in 7G01,
   "Some Enchanted Evening". If you like irony, she was played by Tress
   MacNeille, arguably the best and most prolific voice actress at
   present.


>> The Voice of Roadrunner

Dale G. Abersold:  In the original Roadrunner cartoon, "Fast and
   Furry-ous" (1949), the "meep-meep" of the Roadrunner was provided by
   a claxon.  By the time the second cartoon was produced however ("Beep
   Beep", 1952), the sound-effects people had lost the claxon.  So, they
   buttonholed Mel Blanc and got him to imitate the sound.  It was this
   recording of "Meep-meep" that was used afterwards in the many
   Roadrunner cartoons (This according to Blanc's autobiography "That's
   Not All, Folks."  A great read for those interested in cartoons,
   BTW.)


>> And he didn't have to worry about anyone playing through

Benjamin J. Robinson:  The second astronaut picture Krusty showed us
   came from the Apollo 14 mission (January 31 to February 8, 1971).
   Astronaut Alan Shepard was (and presumably still is) an avid golfer,
   who joked that the moon's reduced gravity would improve his golf
   drive. Just before Shepard was to leave the moon, he produced a ball
   and a "club" made of some leftover scientific equipment. He hit the
   ball an estimated 400 yards.


>> Maybe they're watching us right now

Ryan Johnson:  I noticed that many people seemed suprised, if not
   shocked that the writers were aware of this newsgroup. We've known
   for some time that MG lurks and I think I remember someone quoting
   something that said the writers also read a.t.s. (Dave, help me out
   here =) I'd be shocked if the writers actually listened to what the
   "the show is going downhill crowd" says, but there is no reason to be
   suprsised that the staff of the show probably reads this newsgroup.
   If you were producing a show wouldn't you want to hear what people
   thought about your work? I know I would.


>> Get the chance to harass your favorite voice actor!

Aaron Varhola:  Voice tours are popular, as they draw people into cel
   galleries and comic book stores to meet the voice artists; children
   like hearing the actors do their characters' voices, while adults
   like to see their animation cels go up in value with autographs. :)

   Nancy Cartwright has read childrens' stories at L.A.-area bookstores,
   and Yeardley Smith has done gallery signings at the Comic Art Gallery
   in Melbourne, Australia, and the Cricket Gallery on Martha's
   Vineyard. Another ats/simpsons-l/lsfc denizen has met Harry Shearer
   in Australia as well.

   Probably the most famous one is the Warner Brothers Studio Stores
   voice tours for Animaniacs, where Rob Paulsen, Jess Harnell, Tress
   MacNeille, and Maurice LaMarche appeared at WBSS's all over the
   country in the summer and fall of 1995 to promote Animaniacs and
   Pinky and the Brain. One of the voice tour stops was the weekend of
   the airing of an Animaniacs short, "Please Please Pleese Get a Life
   Foundation", making fun of nit-picking fans; said nit-picking fans
   had a convention in Sacramento that weekend to meet the voice tour.
   :) Previously, Warner Brothers Animation invited a group from
   alt.tv.animaniacs to tour the studio, meet some of the staff, and
   observe the scoring of a short. They also got to see nearly-completed
   versions of two shorts, including Please Please Pleese Get a Life
   Foundation, which was well-received.

   Incidentally, if you see any Simpsons voice actors at a voice tour,
   don't bother them with questions about minuitae. That's what David
   Silverman's presentations are for. :) Or, ask me or some of the other
   obsessed fans here.


>> One of us! One of us!

Dallas Pesola:  The I&S 2F09 blunder that was pointed out by the "Genius
   at Work" guy was hilarious.  My wife was watching with me and turned
   to look a me writing things down.  She said, "You're turing into one
   of them, aren't you?" I just kept writing.  ;-)

Dave Traubert sums it up best with a 1F02 quote:  "They're very nice
   boys, Homer, but they're clearly nerds."


>> Dear fan, IOU one successful cartoon, signed M.G.

Benjamin J. Robinson:  I'm sure the people who tolerate no criticism of
   "The Simpsons" will quote freely from Bart's answer to the Comic Book
   Guy. I'd like to present my counter-argument. Many people are under
   the impression that the networks make their money from the viewers.
   This is only indirectly true. Fox (and the other networks) really get
   their income from the advertisers who air their commercials during
   the shows. The network receives their money whether you like the show
   or not. The only reason they give a damn what *you* think is that
   advertisers aren't dumb enough to buy air time on a show nobody
   watches. When you post your opinion of the show (or write in, or call
   up), you're helping the network attract more viewers, and thus get
   more advertising dollars. That, to me, seems like a fair deal, and I
   plan to speak my mind about this show without feeling that I "owe"
   someone, or even a guilty conscience.

   So there!


>> Aw, just like on TV

By now, you certainly learned that this episode was first and foremost a
   self-reflection -- if not, I give up! There are many obvious
   references,  but more interesting are the subtle hints underneath.
   Here is a non-exhaustive list of correspondences between us and the
   Itchy & Scratchy universe. (Courtesy of Benjamin J. Robinson and Don
   Del Grande)


   At the focus group, the kids cheer loudly for both making the show
   more realistic, and for making it wackier. The same two camps exist
   on a.t.s. (To be fair, though, in real life two different sets of
   people make up the two groups.) In the same way, Bart heralds the
   final "Itchy & Scratchy" cartoon as a return to the old glory. This
   echoes the "old Simpsons vs. new Simpsons" arguments we see on a.t.s.

   Lisa comments that after several years, television characters don't
   have the impact they once have. Some people might apply the same
   sentiment to the Simpsons themselves.

   Lisa gripes that shows only add characters as a desperate ploy to
   boost flagging appeal. Lately, "The Simpsons" has been adding
   one-shot characters (e.g. Disco Stu) who later make repeat
   appearances.

   The woman who voices Itchy and Scratchy remarks that the Roadrunner's
   "meep, meep," was the product of studio tape. On "The Simpsons,"
   Maggie's pacifier sucking, and even some of Homer's "D'oh's," are
   stored on a synthesizer and called up when needed.

   At the autograph signing, an anal-retentive fan points out a silly
   technical goof no "sane" person would ever notice, using the
   episode's p-code. Need I say more? :)

   Homer dismisses "Itchy & Scratchy" as a children's show, just as some
   people do with "The Simpsons."

   Jasper thinks that Bart is a girl; Bart is in fact voiced by Nancy
   Cartwright, who also does Ralph, Rod, Todd, Nelson, Kearney, Wendell
   and Database. Other female-voiced boys include Milhouse, Martin,
   Jimbo, Dolph and Uter.

   The Comic Book Guy jumps onto the Internet to decry the "Itchy &
   Scratchy & Poochie" show as "the worst ever." (Notice he never
   provides any reasoning to back up his assertion.) Anyone who has
   subscribed to a.t.s. for more than four seconds can get this
   reference.

   To "take care of" Poochie, the producers resort to inventing some
   previously unheard-of background information about him. Starting with
   "A Fish Called Selma (3F15)," the "Simpsons" producers have also been
   using this tactic. (Spring to mind Troy McClure [3F15], Apu [3F20],
   Kirk and Luanne Van Houten [4F04] and Ned [4F07].)

   Poochie's last cel is marked "4F12", this episode's p-code.

   Bart heralds the final "Itchy & Scratchy" cartoon as a return to the
   old glory. This echoes the "old Simpsons vs. new Simpsons" arguments
   we see on a.t.s. Similarly, Lisa feels lucky that "they're still
   putting on a program of this caliber after so many years", referring
   to The Simpsons beating The Flintstones' record.


Roger Smith:  One thing in this episode that struck me as particulary
   funny was Homer's question "Is this cartoon done live?" My friend
   from the show mentioned that one of the younger guests at a table
   read once remarked "Wow! I can't wait to tell my friends what's going
   to happen on the Simpsons next week." Of course, it's about nine
   months later that the shows air after the reading.


>> Those Immortal Threads

   - What's the Comic Book Guy's name?

The Comic Book Guy asks for an autograph to himself, and three others to
   some friends "of the same name".

John Manning remarked that Homer has no problem signing those pictures.
   To which Al Sigman replied: "Homer knows more than we give him credit
   for. I'll bet he even knows what state Springfield is in."


>> Loose Ends

Haynes Lee:  I searched the term "Worst Episode Ever" at Deja News and
   the term was quite prominent in the three newsgroups alt.tv.seinfeld,
   alt.tv.x-files and alt.tv.simpsons. The Star Trek newsgroups seem
   quite well behaved.

Benjamin J. Robinson:  In Greek mythology, Cerberus was the three-headed
   hound who guarded the gates of Hades.  I am *not* overly educated.

Haynes Lee:  Check the newsgroup alt.fan.monty-python. Half the posts are
   about tips for playing the Holy Grail CD-ROM game.

Chris Courtois:  What's left for another I&S-based show? Someone asking
   for nude pictures of Itchy?  [LOL -- ed]

Haynes "master of all anagrams" Lee goes after another one:

      Worst episode ever            Poster does review

James R. Cherry mentions that SKY's done it once again, by replacing
   this episode's couch gag with 8F24 (Simpsons meet Flintstones), but
   still leaving the original soundtrack.  "So therefore, while the
   Simpsons are standing still, you here Homer's `Hmmm?' and the sound
   of his feet tapping on the floor as he turns arround."


>> Sing it like you mean it!

Chris Courtois remains faithful to the tradition and provides us with
   some lyrics:

   - [4F12] The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show theme song

      (Voice A is the normal theme song voice; voice B is a new,
      lower-pitched, more dog-like voice.)

      Voice A: They fight!  And bite!
      Voice B: And bark!
      Voice A: They fight and bite and bite!
      Voice B: And bark!
      Voice A: Fight bite bark!
      Voice B: Woof woof woof!
      Voice A: The Itchy and Scratchy
               And Poochie Show!

   - [4F12] Poochie Rap

      Poochie/Homer: The name's Poochie D
                     And I rock the telly,
                     I'm half Joe Camel
                     And a third Fonzarelli.
                     I'm the kung fu hippie
                     From gangsta city,
                     I'm a rappin' surfer,
                     You the fool I pity.


>> Musings from a veteran

Of all alt.tv.simpsons veterans, few (if any) could boast of being more
   expressive and vehement regarding the quality of the show than
   Matthew Kurth. Throughout the years, Matthew often expressed his
   views about the evolution of the show, and harshly criticized the
   rampant growth of laughs over continuity and characterization. Those
   views, and his losing faith in this new direction the writers seemed
   intent to follow, led him to step down as FAQ maintainer after two
   years, last January.

   It is of no surprise that an episode bent on defending the show and
   poking the viewers -- especially die-hard fans -- would induce a
   strong reaction from Matthew. Here is his reply, uncut and unedited.



   At first glance, it's very difficult to figure out exactly what's
   going on in this episode.  If you're a so-called hardcore fan of the
   show, it's quite possible you found it incredibly offensive.  If
   you're one of those fans who claim not to be hardcore, you probably
   laughed your ass off at "those geeks getting what's coming to them".

   Upon second glance, the episode looks like a $1.5M troll and/or "up
   yours" to critical fans -- specifically, those who post regularly to
   a.t.s -- and/or the commercial TV industry in general.  This is
   particularly interesting because all of a sudden the target audience
   has been narrowed to just a few hundred viewers.  Your average
   slack-jawed yokel watching the show was more than likely left
   mystified and wondering what the hell (s)he'd just seen.  This means
   that either the writers have a collective chip on their shoulder, or
   else no one blew the whistle to say, "Wait, what are we doing here?"

   I'm reminded of the MGM cartoon studio of the late 40s.  Bill Hannah
   and Joe Barbara were in friendly competition with Tex Avery's cartoon
   unit, and the two camps tried for months to outdo each other with
   gags and wild takes and general outrageousness, until finally, they
   showed a work print to Fred Quimby, then-Producer.  He watched
   placidly, then turned and said, "I don't understand what's going on."
   The inside gags had gotten so layered that the product was
   incomprehensible to someone not "in the know".

   Considering the dim view taken of die-hard fans, one has to wonder
   for a moment, because even though the writers make the product, where
   would the product be without the fans?  After all, who will go out
   and buy 3 copies of each CD, collect every figurine, doll, and
   T-shirt available?  Certainly your fair-weather fan might pick up one
   CD or a T-shirt with their favorite character -- the die-hard fan
   cannot support the show alone, but you have to wonder about the
   usefulness of biting the hand that essentially feeds them.

   At the same time, it must be said that fan criticism seems to be on
   the rise, at least in visibility if not in amount.  Examinations of
   the Season Three capsules does indeed show that contemporary critics
   were often harsh toward what are now considered classic episodes.
   However, never before have I seen so many document maintainers
   throwing in the towel and proclaiming they're giving up on the show.
   Not only that, but the fans have taken to targeting specific writers
   for perceived slipshod work.  (I'm looking to where Jennifer
   Crittenden's desk used to be...)  And as such, if I were a writer, I
   suppose I'd be scratching my head at what I was seeing coming from
   the mouths of the fans at the same time that the show is receiving so
   much "acclaim", to borrow from Krusty.

   And they must also be scratching their heads at what they've seen as
   far as the fans wanting real life vs. wacky hijinks.  What strikes me
   as interesting though is that almost every member of the test
   audience wanted to see both.  I guess the writers haven't tried
   having one ep to be of one type and the next of another, and not a
   hodge-podge that seems to satisfy no one.

   But one has to wonder exactly what has precipitated this fan bashing,
   or at the very least the seeming bitterness attached to it.  It's
   possible it's disgust at the manner in which every character, object,
   and moving thing winds up being portrayed in some sexually
   compromising position somewhere on the net.  It's possible it's a
   combined superiority-inferiority complex, where the writers are
   asking, "Who do these people think they are that they know so much
   that they can criticize our work?  They couldn't write their way out
   of a paper bag if they had to!" at the same time their work cannot
   seem to hold a candle to the work of those who have come before.  Or,
   as some have suggested, perhaps it is an inevitable result of the
   writers having access to unfiltered opinions of their work --
   something heretofore unheard of in the industry -- coupled with the
   also inevitable running out of situations to use for a show coming up
   on 200 episodes old.

   Now, let's look at what the writers have to say about the fans.  In
   the episode, the geeky fans bandy about p-codes and incredibly
   esoteric continuity errors.  What is stark about this is how the fans
   aren't criticizing the voice acting or the writing, for that matter,
   but editing and sound dubbing -- and they're laying this at the
   footsteps of the voice actors.  This is particular interesting
   because most of the fans who want to be taken seriously disagree with
   the writing above all, and in this episode the writers are shown to
   be lazy but otherwise beyond reproach. The phrase "displaced
   responsibility" presents itself here, should you choose to subscribe
   to that notion, so either the writers are accepting the entire
   responsibility for an episode including mistakes they have no control
   over, or the writers are saying "it's not our fault!".  Of course, it
   may also be just a grand coincidence, because of the obvious
   similarities of the Q&A session to Bill Shatner's famous "Get a Life"
   sketch from Saturday Night Live.  I suppose it's the individual's
   burden to decide.

   I guess, however, that there is still the potential for
   miscommunication, and I wonder whether the writers have been reading
   the episode capsules and the long recitations of goofs and errors and
   getting the impression that they are what most fans are annoyed
   about.  I can't speak for everyone, but I know that most of the
   people I know don't take most goofs too seriously -- particularly
   ones that aren't integral to some failed gag.  This portion of the
   controversy can be addressed only by the writers themselves.

   At the same time that this is going on, Darth (I'm sorry, David) S.
   Cohen presents Emperor Oakley and the rest of the Imperial Writers
   with some 20 minutes of meta-humor and reflexivity.  Things like the
   inclusion of Roy for no reason and dialogue written quite obviously
   out of character to rattle fans' cages seems to suggest that the
   writers set out rather intentionally to flame or at least flame-bait
   die-hard fans.

   In particular, Bart's lines about the fans owing the writers is
   particularly noteworthy.  Based on Emperor Oakley's comments to a
   British TV magazine about Lisa fans complaining about
   characterization as well as private comments to me claiming he cares
   more about Lisa than any "Abject Admirer of Lisa Simpson", I'd almost
   hazard a guess that Oakley wrote Bart's lines himself.  Brendan Dunn
   addressed this issue most accurately when he compared the legacy of
   "The Simpsons" to the reputation of a good restaurant.  The customers
   don't owe the restaurant anything, and the chefs don't owe the
   customers anything.  However, the chefs *do* owe something to the
   reputation of the restaurant.  And this is probably what irritates me
   more than anything.  If the writers are indeed angered at the
   reception their work is getting on a.t.s, then it seems more than a
   bit cowardly that rather than address the fans directly and attempt
   to discuss things openly, they go to their writers' retreat and come
   back to deliver a slap in the face to those individuals who, for
   better or worse, have found inspiration or solace in the program in
   previous years.

   And speaking of the phrase "out of character", it's anybody's guess
   as to just who was *in* character.  Lisa makes a few intelligent
   comments and then shuts her brain off, Bart lectures about viewer
   loyalty, Marge suddenly supports Bart and Lisa watching I&S, Homer is
   just plain uncharacteristic, Roger Meyers doesn't stick up for his
   product, and Krusty is overly melodramatic.  Okay, well, the Comic
   Book Guy is in-character, as are Nelson and Ralph.  However, this
   seems to be part of the troll and as such is only to be expected. How
   clever of the writers to think that writing characters intentionally
   out-of-character is funny.  And incidentally, it's harder to screw up
   toast than Ralph Wiggum's lines.

   In any event, Poochie comes across as nothing more than a reference
   to that bear from "CJ and Jamal" (or whatever that show was).  In
   fact, the magazine cover touting his debut is very reminiscent of the
   Animation Magazine cover for said program.  And of course, that both
   Roy and Poochie were meant to be amalgamations of current trends and
   stereotypes is to be expected.

   Even so, the strongest criticism of the show over the past few
   seasons is that the writers no longer respect the characters they
   write for, and as such this episode is pretty damning evidence, even
   for the sake of meta-humor.  In "The Front", Bart and Lisa accept the
   challenge to take something bad and make it better.  In "Itchy &
   Scratchy & Poochie", however, the message is to sit back and just be
   thankful you have it at all.  You have to wonder about this message
   though in light of Matt Groening's work, which has always been about
   bucking the establishment -- which, in turn, makes me wonder about
   the wisdom in Mr. Groening's showing up in the production offices a
   scant once a month (so I've been told).  It would seem that Oakley &
   Weinstein are the ones in effective control of the show, and for that
   reason, old-school fans can take heart in knowing that Emperor Oakley
   and Jabba the Weinstein are leaving at the conclusion of Season Eight
   -- although it's my understanding that Mike Scully will be assuming
   Executive Producer duties, and from what I've seen of "Lisa on Ice"
   and "Lisa's Date With Density", it could be "out of the frying pan
   and into the fire" for the remainder of the series -- although I'd be
   more than willing to issue a public retraction to this should Mike
   Scully prove me wrong. (And here people were complaining about David
   Mirkin's influence on the show...)

   In the end, it's still hard to say exactly what this episode was
   trying to prove, and as such, perhaps that in itself is the strongest
   criticism of the episode: it doesn't clearly define its targets, nor
   does it really zero in on them, and at the same time, goes one step
   further toward alienating the fans from the old days who remember
   when the show produced the occasional tearjerker and you never had to
   wait more than a week for an episode that probed your intellect, your
   emotions, or both.

   Regardless, the episode will no doubt generate controversy until the
   show lapses into distant memory, for good or ill.  And regardless of
   whether it was intended as flame or troll or something else entirely,
   it's quite obvious that fan-writer relations aren't what they were
   just a scant two years ago.

% Carbolic Acid that he is standing in front of.  The acid streams out

Bart: It's back to the basics, classic "Itchy & Scratchy."
Lisa: We should thank our lucky stars that they're still putting on a
      program of this caliber after so many years.

% The Executive Producer credits go up over static.
