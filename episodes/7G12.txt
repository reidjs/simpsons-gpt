> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>>Springfield Whoop-Ass Team

SWAT stands for Special Weapons And Tactics.  It's a special team that some
police departments have for combating unusually difficult threats.  This is
odd, since Springfield probably 1) wouldn't have the resources to build a
good SWAT team, and 2) probably wouldn't need it, anyways.  The fact that the
SWAT team burst into Krusty's house to arrest him probably means that they had
nothing better to do, since he probably wouldn't be that difficult to handle.

>>Say it Ain't so, Cecil Adams!

Unfortunately, I don't have the Straight Dope book that deals with this, but
the story seems to be popular enough.  In 1919, the Chicago White Sox were
accused of accepting bribes to throw the World Series.  Ultimately, they were
all acquitted, but the baseball commissioner banned them from baseball for
life.

One of the people who provided information on the alleged conspiracy,
``Shoeless'' Joe Jackson, was supposedly confronted by a small boy, who asked
him to ``Say it ain't so, Joe!''  Joe responded, ``Yes, kid, I'm afraid it
is.''

Joe Jackson has denied the story, and it is generally considered that a
Chicago columnist made the story up, but it still persists as an example of the
loss of innocence that came out of the scandal, and presumably Bart's reaction
to Krusty's incarceration.

>>I Wish I had a reason to use this:

Doc Quack has figured out a way to reconcile all of the inconsistencies of
Krusty's illiteracy.

Krusty is really a secret agent, engaged in counter-spying upon a group in
Springfield.  The group is there, trying to find out the amphibious cars (made
only in Springfield) are made and what keeps them afloat.

In order to keep the group off guard, he poses as illiterate whenever one of
the spies are around....

>>Comedy, thy name is Rusty Nails

According to the commentary on the Season 1 DVD, Krusty is loosely modeled
after Rusty Nails, a Christian radio clown.  Groening had a hard time
reconciling the grotesque name with a supposedly nice man, and chose the name
Krusty as a reference to this man.

>>Other observations

Dave Sommer notes that Chapter 34 of _The Man in the Iron Mask_ does not have
anything like what Sideshow Bob said. (A brief glimpse at Chaps. 34 and 35
says that he's right)

Bart+Lisa+Kids: With all our heart!

% Krusty and Sideshow Bob (who does not speak but rather uses a slide whistle)
% are joined on stage by Whitney, a young girl celebrating her birthday.
% Whitney has a choice:  Either Krusty can sing her a birthday song, or they
% can shoot Sideshow Bob out of a cannon.  The audience chants, ``The cannon!
% The cannon!'' and Whitney chooses the cannon.
%
% Sideshow Bob is loaded in the cannon, and Krusty suggests that the reason
% the cannon trick never worked before is that they didn't use enough
% gunpowder!  Whitney ignites the cannon, but when the gunpowder explodes,
% the cannon recoils off the stage.  The cannon tips forward, and Sideshow
% Bob oozes out.  Krusty leads the kids in a tag line...

Krusty: Don't blame me...
Krusty+Kids:  <I> didn't do it!

Comedy, thy name is Krusty.

% Next up is an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.

Bart+Lisa:  [laugh at an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon]
Marge: My, all this senseless violence.  I don't understand the appeal.
Bart:  We don't expected you to, Mom.
Lisa:  If cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time.

% At work, Homer's donut-dunking is interrupted by a phone call from Marge,
% who asks him to pick up a half gallon of Premium ice cream on his way
% home from work.  Homer suspects a trick, and his fears are confirmed when
% Marge explains that Patty and Selma are going to show slides of their
% trip to the Yucatan.  (``D'oh!'')
%
% There's a knock at the door.  The Bouvier twins have arrived.

Oooooh, eight carousels!  We're in for a real treat!
-- Marge welcomes her sisters, laden with slides of their latest trip,

% Bart and Lisa are not pleased by this.
%
% Homer ambles into the Kwik-E-Mart...

Hello, steady customer!  How are you this evening, sir?

% ... and walks past a masked Krusty, heating up a burrito in the microwave.

Mmm... Chocolate...
Ooooh, double chocolate...
Gasp!  New flavor!  Triple chocolate!
-- Homer buys ice cream, ``Krusty Gets Busted''

% He also picks up ``something for the trip back to the cash register'',
% walking past Krusty hiding inconspicuously behind a magazine.

What's the matter, sir?  Never have I seen you so unhappy when you are
purchasing such a large quantity of ice cream.
-- Apu to Homer, ``Krusty Gets Busted''

% As Homer explains that he's going home to suffer through a slide show hosted
% by ``the gruesome twosome'', Krusty crosses over and gets in line behind
% Homer.  As Homer leaves, he accidentally steps on Krusty's foot (earning
% a tongue-lashing), and sees that Krusty has a gun.  Homer dives into the
% potato chips display.

Krusty: [holding a gun]  Hand over all your money in a paper bag.
Apu:    Yes, yes, I know the procedure for armed robbery.
        I do work in a convenience store, you know.
-- ``Krusty Gets Busted''

% Krusty takes the money and leaves.

You can emerge now from my chips.
The opportunity to prove yourself a hero is long gone.

Patty: This is a Mexican delicacy called a `taco platter'.
Selma: Mmm, delicious.

%
% Back at the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer describes the perpetrator to a sketch artist.
% Only after the artist finishes the drawing does Homer recognize the face as
% Cruddy, Crummy... Krusty the Clown!
%
% In his apartment, Krusty mixes himself a drink and relaxes.  Through the
% windows burst a SWAT team, and Krusty is thrown to the floor, a gun pointed
% at his head.

Krusty: Hey, what's going on, here?
Wiggum: Krusty the Clown, you're under arrest for armed robbery.
        You have the right to remain silent.
        Anything you say, blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah.
-- You know the rest, ``Krusty Gets Busted''

% Homer is called to the station to identify Krusty in a line-up.

Send in the clowns!
-- Chief Wiggum prepares for a police line-up, ``Krusty Gets Busted''

% A group of clowns is brought in, and Homer has trouble containing his
% laughter.  (``If the crime is making me laugh, they're <all> guilty!'')

% The kids have already fallen asleep.  ``Very... thorough,'' says Marge as

% of his ordeal, but decides to let the TV news tell the story.

Why did the clown cross the road?
To rob a Kwik-E-Mart.
A new story behind that enigmatic half-joke after this commercial message.
-- Scott Christian anchors the newscast, ``Krusty Gets Busted''

% During the commerical (for Duff Beer), Homer talks to Bart about Krusty.

Homer: Bart, you know that guy on your lunchbox?
Bart:  Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?
Homer: He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?
Bart:  Are you kidding?  He's my idol!
       I've based my life on Krusty's teaching.
-- Krusticism?  ``Krusty Gets Busted''

% Homer tries to get Bart out of the room before the news returns, but too
% late.  Bart: ``Gasp!  Krusty!''  Lisa:  Oh, no!''  Maggie: *suck* *suck*.

Earlier this evening, the Springfield SWAT team apprehended

% And just in, surveillance film from the Kwik-E-Mart security camera.
% Homer's remark about the ``gruesome twosome'' is broadcast for all to hear.

Earth-to-Marge.  Earth-to-Marge.  I was there.  The clown is G-I-L-L-T-Y.
-- Homer, ``Krusty Gets Busted''

% In his room, Bart glumly stares at his huge Krusty poster, then picks up
% a Krusty doll.  He pulls the string, and it says, ``You're
% my best friend.''  Another pull.  ``Buy my cereal!  Wuh-huh-huh-huh!''
% And, ``<I> didn't do it!''

Good evening again, Springfield.  Krusty the Klown, the beloved idol of

-- Kent Brockman reports... ``Krusty Gets Busted''

% He continues, ``From his humble beginnings as a street mime in Tupelo,
% Mississippi, Krusty climbed to the top of a personal mini-empire, with
% dozens of endorsements including his line own line of pork products.
% This may have led to one of television's best-loved bloopers, his near
% fatal heart-attack, in 1986.''

Krusty: Wasn't that a great Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, kids?
        Well, we've got another one coming right up.
