[=========================[Season Thirteen Summary]=========================]

Story cut episodes: DABF02, DABF01, DABF03, DABF05, DABF09, DABF10, DABF14,
                    DABF12.
Compressed episodes: All episodes were compressed.
Expanded episode: DABF02.
Missing lines: CABF21, DABF02, DABF12. 
Changed content: DABF01, DABF14, DABF17.

Total time cut: 9:22 (9 min 22 sec)
Story time cut: 2:27 (2 min 27 sec)
Total time gained: 19:36 (19 min 36 sec)

Notes: For some reason, many episodes in the season 13 syndication package
       have what I call a "voiceless intro." That is, in the cloud and
       driveway scenes, only music is present: no "The Simp-sons," no sound
       effects, and no "d'oh!" or scream from Homer. Sound effects are
       restored in the couch gag. The rule seems to be that whenever the
       intro had to be shortened, this is used (with one exception: DABF05
       always had the short one but it is voiceless in syndication).
       Also, TV ratings do not appear at the top of the screen for any season
       13 episode in syndication (though my V-chip reported them as TV-PG,
       even DABF11; this may just be local, however).
       I had a hard time finding the original end credit timings for some of
       the season 13 episodes. I used the section Fox broadcasts to estimate
       the length and any compression for those, and marked the "ending"
       lines with asterisks; if you have any information on them, please let
       me know.

             Doug: The rocket's ready to go!

         The nerds giggle,
       %                   then Homer steps onto a crate.
       %
       %    Homer: Super! Now if you'll gather round, I'd like to say a few
       %           words.
       %
<0:08> % They do. Homer pauses, then in a slow loud voice:
       %
       %    Homer: All nerds clear the launch area!
       %
       % The three college students and Milhouse walk away dejectedly.
       %
       % Benjamin: [o.s.] Let's wait in the car.
            Homer: Now all we need is our astronaut!

 ~~
         The camera pans slowly up the side of the rocket, until the tip is
         visible at the top of the screen.
       %                                   The camera zooms out to show Homer
       % and Bart standing next to it. Homer consults his Palm Pilot while
       % Bart sets the box down. Cut to a shot of the box (and Bart's legs)
<15.5> % as he picks up Nibbles and puts him on the ground. Nibbles begins to
       % walk. Cut to a closer shot of Nibbles for a few seconds, then to the
       % bottom of the launch tower, where an elevator (complete with hand
       % rails and caution mat) waits. Nibbles walks in and turns around; a
       % windowed door slides down, and the elevator slowly ascends.

         Homer: Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and
                punch the face of God!

 ~~
         Milhouse watches the rocket in flight and his eyebrows fall off.
       % The rocket flies (still with respect to the frame with clouds
       % zipping by behind it) for a few seconds. Cut to a shot of a wino in
       % the gutter. He takes a gulp, looks up, and gasps. From behind him,
       % the rocket is seen soaring across the sky.
       %
       % Wino: Wow, that's it! I'm off the hooch!
       %
<16.5> % He tosses the bottle behind him. Farther down the street, a
       % businessman walks down the sidewalk. The wine lands in his hand.
       %
       %  Man: Hey! Wine!
       %
       % The businessman lies down in the wet gutter, starts drinking, and
       % tosses away his briefcase. Meanwhile, Bart tracks the rocket with
       % binoculars while Homer stands on.
                                           Cut to the view through the
         binoculars, where the rocket starts to fly out of control.

       ! In the original, the dramatic music continues until the wino speaks;
       ! in syndication, some (but not all) of it overlaps the rocket's
       ! erratic flight.

 ~~
       * There was compression from the start of the act, but after Nibbles
       * ejects, it switches to expansion for the rest of it. Go figure.

         Bart puts on a pair of driving gloves.
<0:04> % He then walks left off-screen while Marge blinks a few times.
       % Bart backs the car up,
                                and his head comes into frame. He finishes
         backing up, the camera pans to a trailer hitch on the back, and
         Lisa loops the rope over it.

            Lisa: Now, Bart!

       % Seen from above, the rope is draped around a big rock so that it
       % dangles down the cliff. Bart starts to drive off-screen to the top
       % left, while Lisa, Marge, and Maggie stand there. Dramatic music.
       %
       % The camera pans down to show Homer and Gabriel slowly ascending,
       % then cuts to a closer shot from them. A growl is heard from below,
       % and they both scream.
       %
       % Cut to the animals standing on each other's backs (about six
       % alternating wolves and cougars). A cougar climbs to the top and
<0:26> % leaps up, swinging its paw. It just misses Homer and Gabriel.
       % They scream again.
       %
       % Gabriel: Give them the food!
       %
       % Homer unzips the backpack, reaches in, and dumps out five roast beef
       % sandwiches from a plastic bag. They land on the ground, and the
       % animals go toward them and start eating.
       %
       %   Homer: Oh no, the roast beef is making 'em stronger! And the
       %          falafel is making 'em angrier!

         As they swing on the rope, a wolf comes up from the bottom left
         and they scream. Homer wails, and the camera pans down to show that
         the animals have constructed a see-saw-like device to throw them up
         in the air. The wolf jumps on it, and a cougar flies into the air.
         They scream again. The cougar begins falling,
       %                                               and continues to fall.
       %
       % Gabriel: Give 'em the beer!
       %
       % Another wolf comes up from the left.
       %
       % Gabriel: It will impair their motor skills!
       %   Homer: [grabbing the bag to himself] NO! [slowly] I will _never_
       %          [after he looks inside, his voice returns to normal and
       %          he pulls out a six-pack] oh, wait, it's Blatz.
<0:18> %
       % He lets the beer fall. It lands, and the animals crowd around it.
       % They bite into the cans, which spray all over, and they shake them
       % in their mouths to make them open. Cut to several beer puddles on
       % the ground, which the animals lap up with their tongues.
       %
       % Cut to a bigger puddle, in which four animals are rolling around,
       % while another holds a can in its paws like catnip, drinking from it.
       %
       % Homer and Gabriel watch the drunk animals as they rise.
       %
       %   Homer: Hey, they're all right!

       + In syndication, to account for plot, a few scenes were moved around.
       + After the cougar falls (before the above cut), 2 seconds of the
       + aerial shot of the car driving away are seen, followed by about two
       + seconds of Homer and Gabriel going up (the last part of the above
<-0:04>+ cut. However, instead of saying "Hey, they're all right!" we have
       +
       +   Homer: --ha, we did it!
       +
       + It seems spliced in abruptly from somewhere else rather than
       + rerecorded, but I can't locate it elsewhere in this episode/season.

         In the car, the Simpsons sing about their adventure.

       ! Note that in the syndicated version, Homer's line "wolves and
       ! cougars ate our roast beef!" makes no sense, since that wasn't seen.
