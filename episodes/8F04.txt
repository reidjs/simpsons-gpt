Cut from clouds directly to driveway.

Driveway   :- Homer says nothing when Lisa scoots past.

Couch:     :- The couch tips over, and Maggie sits where the couch used to be.

Couch:     :- First view of living room shows 4-armed, one-eyed green
              octopus-alien lounging in the Simpsons' couch, drinking
              from a can (beer?).  It apparently sees the Simpsons
              coming, squeals, then pulls something from above which
              opens a trap door in the floor which it subsequently dives
              through and closes.   Then the Simpsons rush in and all
              leap on the couch - and none fall out.

>> US of A TODAY

    AMERICA'S FAVORITE PENCIL
    #2 IS #1
            (and a useless colorful graphic)

David A. Berson {dab} observes that there is a picture of a soldier on the
front of the US of A today.  At the beginning his eye is open.  Then half
way thru he closes it.

Dave Hall {dh} thinks that might be a picture of Ms. Botz [7G01] on the
front page.

>> Havoc at the plant

    - Workers run amok.
    - Two employees smash a Buzz Cola machine and pilfer sodas.
    - Another comployee runs past with a Macintosh computer (complete
      with keyboard and mouse).
    - A small group of employees prays.
    - Rats abandon the plant.  (cf. a sinking ship, notes {gwh})

After the danger is averted...

    - The two employees set the Buzz Cola machine back upright and
      look around nervously.
    - The praying employees get up.
      Sean Graves (sean@cs.tamu.edu) observes that they look embarrassed
      that they were caught praying in public.
    - A man and a woman emerge from a closet.  (See dialogue below.)
    - The rats return to the plant.

J. D. Baldwin {jdb} observed, ``When the couple came out of the storage
closet after the meltdown was averted, the top box in storage is labelled
with the International Radiation Symbol and the words `PLUTONIUM RODS (100
count)'.  It is stacked directly on top of a box of `3000 Plastic Spoons'.
For some reason, this cracked me up.''

Outside...

    - The comic book store owner [7F21] hawks, ``I survived the Springfield
      nuclear scare'' T-shirts.  (So much for his bachelor's in Folklore
      and Mythology.)

>> Bart's photo album

    - Bart-O The Great, picture of Bart as a magician and Milhouse nervously
      playing the role of the girl-in-the-box about to be sawed in half.
    - Milhouse in a hospital bed lifting his shirt, revealing stitches
      on his chest (presumably from Bart's failed magic trick),
      while Bart makes bunny-ears behind him.
      Observe that Bart is still wearing his magician's turban. {tws} {kg}
    - At the beach, Bart covering Milhouse completely in sand.

Keith Goolsbey {kg} adds:

In regard to their mothers meeting after they had drunk paint, why do you
assume that Bart only put Milhouse in the hospital once?  I could see Bart
making Milhouse a regular visitor to Springfield General.

Dave Hall {dh}:

After reviewing the pictures, I concluded that the hospital picture is
actually an Animation Goof.  From the pictures, I found several points to
`disprove' both theories.

To disprove the Appendix theory:

- Although the stitches are on the right side of Milhouse, the incision is
  above the belly-button.
- If Milhouse just had his appendix removed, he should be wearing a hospital
  gown rather than a top.
- Bart wearing his turban from the magic act.

To disprove the Saw-cut theory:

- Stitches on wrong side of Milhouse.
- Angle of `Bart-o' picture indicates that a grown-up had possible took the
  shot.  If this thinking is sound then I don't think a grown-up would
  actually let Bart cut another kid.  [Maybe the grown-up thought Bart
  knew what he was doing. --rjc]
- If Bart actually did cut Milhouse with the saw (and at that angle), then
  I think the harm wouldn't warrant a hospital stay because I would think
  Bart would have stopped sawing before he did any serious damage.
  [Maybe Bart thought Milhouse's screams were part of the act? -- rjc]
- If Bart did seriously damage Milhouse to warrant a stay in the hospital, I
  would think Bart would have been punished.  His smiling face in the
  picture indicates that this hasn't happen.  For that matter, I would think
  Milhouse (or his mother) would have held some resentment towards Bart.
  (Probably enough resentment to have Bart banned from his room.)

And, of course, the ``best of both worlds'' theory:
- Milhouse's appendix became inflamed during Bart's act.

>> Bart's game of Monopoly

Theron Stanford {tws}:

I think that Bart may have set up the board wrong, for he clearly picks up
the stack of `Community Chest' cards.  `Chance' cards are orange;
`Community Chest' cards are yellow, the same color as the cards Bart picks
up.  Also, the card Bart chooses, namely, ``You have won second prize in a
beauty contest'' (Bart paraphrases this for Maggie), is a `Community
Chest' card, not a `Chance' card.

The details of the board have been rather faithfully reproduced, in my
opinion.  The `Community Chest' square Bart lands on is in the middle of
the orange color group, just like on the real McCoy, for instance.

[I agree with Mr. Stanford that we should just call them the `Community
Chance' cards. --rjc]

Dave Hall {dh}:

When playing Monopoly, note that Bart's token was the Top Hat.  (cf. [7F13])
Note also that he didn't develop his properties evenly.

===============================================================================
> Chronology
===============================================================================

One the one hand, Homer was promoted to the safety control room in
`Homer's Odyssey'.  On the other hand, he was playing with a Rubik's Cube,
which would place the flashback at around 1982.  Although Ford left the
presidency in 1976, this isn't much of a problem since that just means
that `Project Bootstrap' was initiated during the Ford Administration, not
that it ended when Ford left office.  (For example, if Burns were forced
to promote Homer because of a Department of Energy regulation, he could
have sarcastically thanked President Carter.)

I won't even try to reconcile this with the already-internally-inconsistent
job file in the Fall '91 Simpsons Illustrated.

===============================================================================
> Animation goofs
===============================================================================
Monty's color ``paid for themselves'' surveillance monitors have reverted
to black-and-white.

Dave Hall {dh}:

Although Bart signed the card, you don't see his writing when Lisa read it.

During the bus ride, Martin is in the seat in front of Bart, Milhouse, but
when they arrive at school, Martin is two seats in front of Bart.  Sherry
and Terry should be sitting behind Bart & Milhouse but aren't.  (Of
course, they might've changed seats during the ride.)

The surveilance monitor depicts Karl and Lenny sitting at a clean table,
facing each other, with Homer in between them, munching on a donut. Yet,
this is not the same setup when the scene switches over to them talking.

The scene where Smithers confesses his love for Burns shows Burns resting
his bare hands on the chair's armrest, yet in close up, Burns hands are
gloved and folded against his chest.

When Burns greets Homer in the cafeteria, his shadow is in a profile.
Burns would have to walk up to Homer sideways in order to produce that
shadow.

Although the stage curtain is drawn back to show the `Employee of the
Month' Award wall, the wide shot of Homer talking on the phone with Magic
Johnson still shows the curtain closed.

During the Monopoly scene, Marge's ball of yarn shrinks a lot.  Maybe
she's a fast knitter.  The Monopoly box disappeared when Bart took Maggie
outside.

The digital time-stamp on the bank videotape does not agree with the clock
on the wall above Chief Wiggum.

===============================================================================
> Maggie Watch
===============================================================================
Maggie fell thrice.  When Marge is praying, when the kids watch I&S,
and when Homer comes home.

Dave Hall {dh}:

Notice the cute way Maggie was holding the yarn for Marge, and the cute
way she prayed before she fell down.

===============================================================================
> Animation changes
===============================================================================
The original airing had Burns' line as ``I guess there's nothing left but to
kiss my sorry butt good-bye.''  When the episode repeated (at 8:30pm instead
of 8:00pm as part of a FOX promotional ``one hour of the Simpsons'' stunt),
it became ``kiss my sorry ass good-bye.''  But, unfortunately, the law of
conservation of mild profanity rears its ugly head, and Bart's ``Bad
influence, my ass!'' became ``Bad influence, my butt!''  (Ruining the joke
in the process.)  The animation still has Bart's mouth saying ``ass''.
The Canadian rebroadcast was uncensored.  Let's see what Channel Ten does...

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> For non-American viewers

USA Today is a colorful newspaper, called McPaper by some because it
dispenses news in bite-sized pieces.  You can pretty much read an entire
USA Today while waiting at a stoplight.

The SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) is a standardized test taken by
college-bound high school seniors.

>> If you listen carefully, you'll notice that Lisa's line ``I will, Mr.
Gumbel, but if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad for my school
paper.'' was not spoken by Yeardley Smith, but rather by whoever did the
voice of Maria Diminguez in [8f01].  (Or if it was Ms. Smith, she forgot
to add Lisa's endearing nasality.)  The very next line, ``I thought it
would be neat...'' was back in proper Lisa-form.

>> Plot goof:  When Bart gives Milhouse the walkie-talkies, he explicitly
says that Milhouse should call him first, so that Bart can turn on his
walkie-talkie.  Yet twice later in the episode, we hear Bart's
walkie-talkie crackle to life without Bart having to turn it on.

>> Day-of-week:  Smithers clearly states that it is Monday.  (TGIM, sir.)
And who says that Otto was planning on returning from Mexico in time to
pick up the kids from school?

>> Mark Eckenwiler (eck@panix.com) identifies the tune Otto was humming as
``the hook from Johnny Winter's top-40 instrumental "Frankenstein".
(duh-duh-da-da-di-di-di-duh)''

-- Just asking, ``Homer Defined''

% On TV...

Prof. John Fink:  [indicating on a map]  These unfortunate people here will

       we are in, will experience a slower, considerably more painful death.
Kent:  Good Lord!
-- Analyzed to death?  ``Homer Defined''

% At school, Lisa's class is huddled under their desks...

    method, but who's laughing now!
-- ``Homer Defined''

% The computer cheerfully announces, ``Fifteen seconds to core meltdown.''
% Homer has settled on ``Eenie, meenie, miney, moe'' to decide which

-- Wheel of Misfortune, ``Homer Defined''

% Marge watches the news report...

Burns:  [voice only]
        Yes, we've isolated the problem.  Wouldn't you know, false alarm.
Marge:  Phew!
Burns:  It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system.
Kent:   Very good.  Well, sir, your point about nuclear hysteria is well-taken.
        This reporter promises to be more trusting and less vigilant
        in the future.
Burns:  [in his office, still wearing his radiation suit]
        Excellent.  Well, ta!

% the bottle.
%
% Meanwhile, at lunch, Bart pulls the ol' loose-top-on-the-salt-shaker
% trick on Milhouse, to get back at him for not inviting him to his
% birthday party.

Milhouse: Bart, my mom won't let me be your friend any more.
          That's why you couldn't come to the party.
Bart:     What's she got against me?
Milhouse: She says you're a bad influence.
Bart:     [slams his hand on the table]  Bad influence, my ass!
          How many times have I told you?  Never listen to your mother!
-- What he said, ``Homer Defined''

% Mrs. Van Houten threatened to cut off Milhouse's allowance, and
% Bart offers to pay him double it.  But Milhouse doesn't accept.
%
% Meanwhile, Smithers tries to convince Burns that he deserves the EotM
% award, but Burns' mind is made up.  In the cafeteria...

Karl:  Hey, way to save our lives!
Len:   Yeah, we owe you one!
Homer: Yeah, you know, boys, a nuclear reactor is a lot like a woman.
       You just have to read the manual and press the right buttons.
-- ``Homer Defined''

% Burns arrives and simply says to Homer, ``Come with me.''
%
% As the audience chants, ``Homer!  Homer!'', he is given the EotM award,
% receiving a ham, a plaque, and discount coupon book from a voluptuous
% woman, a thumbs-up from Burns, and his picture (the old one, back when
% Homer had some hair) added to the `Wall of Fame', which we see consists
% otherwise entirely of photos of Smithers.  And...

Burns: Oh, and what's this?  A congratulatory phone call from Earvin
       `Magic' Johnson?
Homer: [gasps]  Magic Johnson!?  [picks up the phone]  Yello?
Magic: [calling from the arena]  Is this really Homer Simpson?
Homer: Yeah.
Magic: Wow.  Homer, I just used our last time-out to call and congratulate
       you on averting that nuclear holocaust.
-- On his way to Disneyland, ``Homer Defined''

% Homer asks, ``What if people think a guy's a hero, but he was really
% just lucky.''  Magic replies, ``Don't worry.  Sooner or later, people

% The kids watch an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, but only Lisa laughs.

Lisa: [laughing at an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon]
      Bart, you're not laughing.  Too subtle?
-- ``Homer Defined''

% Homer arrives and fails to hide the ham and plaque from Marge.

Marge: [reading the plaque]  For heroic competence, for narrowly
       averting a meltdown, and proving without question that
       nuclear power is completely safe.  Employee of the Month!
-- ``Homer Defined''

% Homer envisions himself listed in the dictionary under, `Fraud'.
% At the dinner table...

A role model in my very own home.  How convenient!

Homer: Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work!

-- No argument from Bart, ``Homer Defined''

Marge: How are you enjoying your ham, Homey?
Homer: Tastes so bitter, it's like ashes in my mouth...
Marge: Hm.  It's actually more of a honey glaze.
Lisa:  Maybe you ate a clove.
-- Marge and Lisa uncharacteristically miss a metaphor, ``Homer Defined''

Homer: [angrily] What's <your> problem, boy?
Bart:  I had a fight with Milhouse.
Homer: That four-eyes with a big nose?  You don't need friends like that.
Lisa:  How Zen...
-- Dinner conversation, ``Homer Defined''

% That evening, Homer watches bowling on TV, munching on salty snacks,
% as Lisa lies on her stomach on the floor and gazes admiringly...

Homer: What is it?  What are you doing?
Lisa:  Looking at you with quiet awe.
Homer: Well, as long as it's quiet.
-- ``Homer Defined''

% In his room, Bart looks through a photo album with pictures of Milhouse,

% Homer is rewarded with a covered parking spot right next to the boss,
% but when he opens his car door, he scratches Burns' paint job.
% (``D'ah, he'll never know who did it.'')  Meanwhile, Smithers now must
% park in the main lot, and finds a spot a half mile from the plant.

Burns:  Ah, Simpson, here's someone I want you to meet.
        Aristotle Amodopoulos, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power
        Facility.  It seems Ari's been having terrible worker
        problems at Shelbyville.
Ari:    They've lost their zest for work.  You must help them find their
        ine-haratu-nadzu-leri [or whatever].
Homer:  Their ine-aratu-zoola-what?
Ari:    Yes!
-- Just checking, ``Homer Defined''

We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of
donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons!
-- Burns seems to have missed the point, ``Homer Defined'

% Homer says he can't, but Burns says it's one of the responsibilities
% of being Employee of the Month.  Smithers finally arrives, breathless,
% and complains about the parking.  Burns and Ari gasp, and Burns sends
% Smithers away.  (``That one's always been a problem.'')

% At home, Bart plays Monopoly with Maggie.  He lands on Community Chest
% and looks through the deck to find a card he likes.

Maggie: [playing Monopoly with Bart]
        [removes her pacifier, coughs up a hotel]

Bart:   [holding up the box]  Don't worry, Mom.  There's tons of these things.
-- ``Homer Defined''

Marge: Why don't you go play with Milhouse?
Bart:  I don't want to play with Milhouse.
Marge: You mean you still haven't made up with him?
Bart:  It's his mom.  She says I'm a bad influence.

       hornet's nest.
Marge: Mmm...

Mrs.V: I remember.

% Mrs.V invites Marge in for tea.

Marge: I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside.
       He's got a spark.  It's not a bad thing.  ... Of course, it makes
       him <do> bad things...
Mrs.V: Well, Marge, the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf `sucks'.
       He must've gotten that from your little boy, because they
       certainly <don't> say that on TV.
-- Of course, ``Homer Defined''

% ready...

Barney: So next time somebody tells you carney folk are good, honest people,
        you can spit in their faces for me!
Lisa:   I will, Mr. Gumbel, but if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad
        for the school paper.  I thought it would be neat to follow him around
        for a day to see what makes him tick.
Barney: Aw, that's sweet.  I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars, too.
        [belch]

-- Moe, ``Homer Defined''

Lisa:  He's just a little nervous.  He has to give a speech tomorrow on
       how to keep cool in a crisis.
Homer: [shaking Lisa in a panic]  What am I going to do!?
       What am I going to do!?
-- You could see that gag coming, couldn't you?  ``Homer Defined''

Barney: I had to give a speech once.  I was pretty nervous, so I used a

Homer:  Did it work?
Barney: I'm a free man, ain't I?
-- A mixed blessing, ``Homer Defined''

% Meanwhile, Bart is playing chess with Maggie, who is sucking on the white

Bart:     Really?  We can be friends again?  Did your mom die?
Milhouse: Um, I don't think so.
Bart:     Well, who cares.
-- Would you like to check?  ``Homer Defined''

% Bart announces to Marge that he's friends with Milhouse again, and Marge
% is pleased.  He thanks her for sticking up for him.  How did he know?

% a ``Dead Eye BB Gun''.
%
% At the Shelbyville plant, Homer is introduced to a large audience.

As I look out into this sea of smiling faces, I am filled with a sense of
[suddenly turns nasty] loathing and revulsion!  You are not workers!  You
are a pack of mangy, cud-chewing, ugly goats!
-- Aristotle Amodopoulos gives his employees a pep talk, ``Homer Defined''

% Although
% at first nervous, he remembers Barney's suggestion.  (Barney's ghostly
% elocution here is priceless.)  He puts it into action, and it works.  That
% is, until he looks down at himself and sees that he's also in his underwear.
% He hides behind the podium and reads his speech hesitantly.

Homer: [nervously reading a speech]  Grace under pressure is no...
Voice: [sirens wail]  Three minutes to meltdown.
       [the auditorium empties in a panic]
Homer: Phew!  Saved by the bell.

I'm Kent Brockman, and that was `My Two Cents'.
-- A brief editorial, ``Homer Defined''

% Next is Scott Christian with ``Laugh and a Half''.  His first item is
