Blackboard:     I WILL NOT HIDE THE TEACHER'S MEDICATION  {ddg}

Couch:          The couch isn't in its usual spot in the living room.
                Instead, there's a valet, standing next to a "valet parking"
                sign.  The family runs up to the sign, and the valet gets the
                couch.  The Simpsons hop onto the couch, but don't tip the
                valet, who walks away, miffed.

> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... pictures of Sideshow Bob, Nelson, and either Matt Groening or George
       Lucas are all on CBG's "banned" wall?  [There is some question about
       the identity of the third man on the "banned" wall.  See "Comments"
       section for more -- Ed.]

Don Del Grande:
   ... this is the third blackboard quote to mention "medication"?
   ... when something is spilled on Radioactive Man #1000, it spills onto
       "Bongo Comics" (complete with Bongo the rabbit on it)?
   ... Bart wasn't banned for life for trying to use a fake credit card in
       4F16?
   ... Lisa's reading "The Daily Set-Up" rather than the Springfield Shopper?
   ... Lisa tells Milhouse she's impressed in something he did, and he didn't
       "melt"?
   ... the bird that tears up the Biclops comic sounds like the SNPP crow?
   ... Pamela Hayden received a "Starring" credit (as opposed to an "Also
       Starring" one)?

Joe Green:
   ... CBG has a poster for the "Invasion of the Saucer Men" movie?

Aaron Hirshberg:
   ... there is a lava lamp on a table next to the bed when the police bust in
       on CBG and Agnes?

Darrel Jones:
   ... CBG actually says, "Worst episode ever" during "Worst Episode Ever"?
   ... Agnes Skinner dresses like a 1920's flapper for her date?
   ... for a guy who likes to collect things for their value, CBG allowed his
       Bread record to warp an awful lot?
   ... Chief Wiggum calls Comic Book Guy "Comic Book Guy" while arresting him?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Milhouse wears My Little Pony underwear?

Chad Lehman:
   ... Gallagher -- not a bodyguard -- *personally* throws young Homer out the
       door?
   ... we hear CBG laugh for only the second, third, and fourth times?

Andrew Levine:
   ... the Biclops' facial features (shape and placement of eyes, nose, and
       mouth) resemble Milhouse's?
   ... a silhouette of Skinner hangs on his wall?  (see "The Principal and the
       Pauper")
   ... you can see CBG's crotch in a brief frame or two when he leaves Agnes'
       bed? (see also Lisa in "Simpsons Roasting Over An Open Fire")
   ... no references to CBG's apparent lack of a name were made?  (Good for
       the writers!)

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... during his "antacid trip," foam dribbles out of Homer's nostrils?

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Steve Alpert:  The comic store owner IS Comic Book Guy, as Wiggum himself
   says. I think Agnes was a poor choice for him, because of the age
   difference, but insults becoming love is a parody of similar situations and
   thus wasn't altogether awful.  That scene was unsettling, and lowered my
   appraisal of this episode significantly. As for the comic book store being
   run, I think all that went well.  (B)

Don Del Grande:  This one started out with "best episode of the season"
   potential, but unfortunately fell into a rut somewhere around the time Bart
   started fighting with Milhouse.  (B+)

Wayne Gerard:  I liked and disliked this episode.  Some of the logic didn't
   seem to work with me, such as, why would the comic guy ban his best
   customers (Martin, Milhouse, and Bart all bought a $100 comic), and I just
   don't see why they got together.  Hilarious though, the 2nd and 3rd acts
   really worked for me, the 3rd especially was really funny (I'll lighten the
   sentence if you'll put your pants on!)  (B)

Joe Green:  A slightly above average episode, particularly since it focused on
   the kids (in fact, Homer had a *very* small role) for a change.  It also
   gets points for a good Ralph Wiggum quote ("Everybody's hugging!") but
   otherwise wasn't much to write home about.  (B+)

Darrel C. Jones:  "Worst Episode Ever" hardly lived up to its title.  For the
   first time in weeks, I totally forgot to rate the ep as good or bad while
   watching it. It was excellent, and I loved both plots.  A solid classic,
   through and through.  10/10  (A+)

Jamie Liddell:  A mixed bag without a doubt -- it was amusing and engaging yet
   messy and quite forgettable.  Bart & Milhouse running the comic book store
   is a well executed (if slightly stupid) story, and offers up by far the
   best parts of the episode with some wonderful Bart & Milhouse scenes (which
   are of course traditionally excellent).  However, the pairing of CBG &Agnes
   Skinner in the subplot was hopelessly contrived, unconvincing and strangely
   unfunny for two traditionally funny individuals.  We got barely any of
   CBG's stinging sarcastic quips and very little of Agnes's grouching (i.e.
   barely any of their actual characters).  [...] Worst Episode Ever is
   definitely worth watching for the comic book store plot alone, but its many
   flaws bring it down substantially, and will probably cause it to be pretty
   much forgotten.  (C+)

Troy J. Mathews:  Overall not a bad episode, although the scene between Angus
   and the Comic Book Guy was "unsettling".  I would have given an extra point
   on the grading scale if the show would have told me the real name of the
   comic store owner.  (B-)

Michael Nusair:  Fortunately, "Worst Episode Ever" didn't live up to its
   title.  More like "Most Average Episode Ever."  While it did have a few
   laughs, just as many fell flat.  However, of those jokes that didn't work,
   they didn't leave a sour taste in my mouth like they do in some other
   episodes.  They just weren't very funny.  [...] Other than that though, a
   very solid episode.  Good characterization all around.  Honourable mention
   goes to the radioactive gorilla wearing a seatbelt in Flanders' car, which
   had to have been one of the funnier visual gags in a while.  However, for
   an episode with a lot of CBG and Milhouse, "Worst Episode Ever" wasn't
   nearly as funny as it could have been.  (B-)

Mike Reed:  Is "Worst Episode Ever" the worst episode ever?  No, but what it
   is, is somewhat hard to pin down.  Some scattered laughs dot the episode
   (like Homer's antacid trip, an unexpected ROTFL, and Milhouse's reaction to
   the Kent Brockman clip) but some others come across as somewhat
   forgettable.  For instance, they could've had a little more fun with the
   tapes than they did.  CBG's romance with Agnes felt somewhat tacked on, and
   the ending leaves us hanging.  Why did CBG get arrested?  And what's the
   deal with that ape?  Overall, a mixed effort.  But not the "worst episode
   ever."  (B+)

Robin Steinmann:  Mixed episode beginning with more deconstructing of Homer,
   which led over to the best parts of the show.  Milhouse is just a great
   character, and his chemistry with Bart, as well as his unrequited affection
   for Lisa, is always hilarious.  His scenes were just bound to score, and
   they did.  The hidden video vault made some very funny moments possible.
   Very nice material here.  Having the Comic Book Guy have ongoing space
   after his episode, on the other hand, was probably not the best decision.
   Although I didn't find his affair with Agnes repulsing, there would have
   been better way to fill the episode, either with a different sideplot or
   more Milhouse. More really bad writing, but not the most inspired
   possibility.  (B-)

Robert Todd:  I've just got one question, Where's Homer?  Apart form the
   Antacid trip at the start, I can't remember Homer making any contribution
   to this episode.  Which can only be a good thing.  An A grade; in a Scully
   episode, I'd never though I'd do this, but this one epitomized the
   increasing quality of the Simpsons in recent episodes, as the reign of
   terror starts to wind down.  (A)

Yours Truly:  Give the writers credit for chutzpah:  The title just about
   dares you to give this show a bad review.  I won't, even though it doesn't
   live up to its potential.  It could have gone in one of two directions,
   either for comic-book-style silliness, or a semi-serious fleshing out of
   CBG's character.  Bart and Milhouse's situation just devolves into mundane
   fighting, and instead of exploring CBG's life we just get a romance between
   him and Agnes Skinner.  (Now *there's* an answer to a question no one
   asked.)  Some of the jokes (like Dr. Hibbert, Biclops, and the bootleg
   tapes) and an enjoyable guest appearance by Tom Savini help out, but
   ultimately it's a run-of-the-mill show.  With a name like "Worst Episode
   Ever," you'd expect a little better.  (B-)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B+ (3.20)   Std Dev.: 0.5841   (17 reviews computed)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Musical References

Darrel Jones:  "Puppy Love" by Paul Anka (1960) played during CBG's "loving"
   romp with Agnes Skinner


E. Kadouri:  "Baby I'm-A Want You" by Bread was playing during Agnes's and
   CBG's make out session.  [{dj} notes it's from 1971.  {al} asks, "Wouldn't
   "Make It With You" have been more appropriate?" -- Ed.]


>> Meta-reference corner

Chad Lehman thinks the writers took the opportunity to toss a few barbs at the
   hard-core fans:  1.  CBG's grading of the hand ... D+ ... this tips us off
   that, in this scene, CBG is *us* -- or, the stereotypically humorless
   A.T.S. poster -- who grades EVERYTHING.  Next, he's given a huge wedgie as
   retribution.  Take THAT, A.T.S! Love, the writers.

   2.  Halfway through the "wedging", the hand stops, and the audience laughs
   at CBG.  Then he quips "YOU ... mocking ME?  Oh, <that> is rich."  Ironic,
   isn't it?  CBG (or, the representation of ATS) doesn't even understand that
   the writers are mocking him -- at least until this point.  They're saying
   "you're too stupid to understand how we're mocking you, CBG (A.T.S).  It
   would take something like a wedgie, given by 'Thing' for you to get it."

   3.  Possibly the most clever dig at internet fans: Chief Wiggum: Uh, these
   (videos) yours son?  Milhouse: No, sir.  We're just exhibiting them for
   profit, without permission.  Chief Wiggum: Fair enough.

   Even though it's an exaggeration to state that fans (esp. those making
   websites) charged money for online clips of the Simpsons, it's still
   recognizable as a dig at those fans.  Chief Wiggum saying "Fair enough" is
   the opposite of what a normal policeman (or possibly lawyer, named Dennis
   Wilson) would say; the irony and sarcasm make this satirical commentary.

   4.  I think the Marge/pancake joke was even a light clout to the head of
   some fans.  Many people complained about Marge's "audible gas" from AABF23.
   What does she do here?  She quickly apologizes for what is really "just a
   funny little noise", and puts a silencer on the bottle.  The commentary is
   "it's just a funny noise, people.  Is it that big of a deal?"  I may agree
   with that logic; but, I'd have to say I prefer different humor to the
   "bodily noise" variety.


>> People in the news

Benjamin Robinson:  Homer tries to pass himself off as Shaquille O'Neal, the
   professional basketball player.  Currently with the Los Angeles Lakers,
   O'Neal is one of the biggest men in a league already known for its
   abundance of tall people.  In fact, the Homer-Milhouse-Bart combo seems
   about as tall as "Shaq" is just by himself.

   Mr. (Fred) Rogers is the host of "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" (or maybe was;
   I haven't seen it in years).  Rogers was known for his extraordinarily
   placid, soothing on-screen persona.  Off the set, he was ... pretty much
   the same, which makes the blooper reel such a find.  Rogers typically wore
   a cardigan sweater on the show, which is probably what he's ranting about
   on the tape.


>> Luke's father is Chewbacca?

Joe Klemm:  One of the biggest ending secrets that ever appeared in films was
   that of the Empire Strikes Back, where Darth Vader reveals that he is
   Luke's father.  [Ooooh, I hope that wasn't a spoiler for anyone reading
   this -- Ed.]  Since this will be a major factor in the saga, George Lucas
   had to keep it secret from many people, including those working on the
   film.  To do so, the script that was read when the scene was shot actually
   stated that Obi-Wan Kenobi was really Luke's dad.  Then, when it came time
   for James Earl Jones to voice Vader, the true ending was completed and
   nobody but Jones, Lucas, the director, and the sound recorder will know
   what was expected as the film reached that point.


>> Who was that banned man?

So, who was the bearded man whose photo was on the "banned for life" wall?
   <alt.tv.simpsons> regulars has a variety of opinions.


Mike Reed speaks for the majority when he guesses:  Matt Groening, creator of
   "The Simpsons."


Rick Nelson adds:  It was Matt Groening, because the time he was drawn
   seriously (i.e. NOT the 138th show spectacular), that's how he was drawn.
   This was during the couch scene when he comes out and signs his name, and
   Marge rubs it off with a rag.


Someone named "Ozmodiar" writes:  If by "that's how he was drawn" you mean
   different style attire, different color beard (gray v. brown), different
   hair part (center v. left side) then, yes, "that's how he was drawn."

   I didn't think it was him initially.  if it is supposed to be an old photo
   (younger MG) then I suppose it could be.


Rory Bellows says:  I don't know ... it kinda looked like Spielberg


Haynes Lee:  George Lucas.  All those bearded Hollywood honchos look the same
   to me.


Benjamin Robinson:  I think it would have been funnier if Lucas *had* been
   banned by CBG as though even he couldn't live up to CBG's standards.  "All
   right, enough about Jar Jar already.  Jeez, it's just a movie."


Matt Gasaway adds:  Come to think of it, with all of the internet-geek ire
   pointed at G. Lucas, it DOES make a lot of sense to have it be him .....


Finally, Jesse Cohen suggests:  Barney.


>> Banned for life!

James Allen:  His [Gallagher's] most "famous" bit was "Sledge-O-Matic," where
   he would end his shows by destroying various items with a sledgehammer,
   culminating with a watermelon. There's your joke: Homer ate the watermelon,
   thus depriving Gallagher of his big finish.

   He's never had a significant part in a movie.

   It's interesting to note that there was another homage of sorts to
   Gallagher in the episode, when all the guts went flying into the audience
   during the show in the comic book store.

   Some of Gallagher's old Showtime specials crop up on Comedy Central from
   time to time.  You see one of them and you've seen them all.


Benjamin Robinson adds:  Gallagher was one of the first comedians to make it
   big as a "prop comic" -- someone who uses oddball props as the basis for
   the jokes he tells.


Jesse McCann:  There was a big push a few years ago from Gallagher's friends
   (including "The Man Show's" Adam) to build a movie around him.  Thankfully,
   everyone declined.


Dave "Ratboy" adds:  I guess maybe his shows are hit-or-miss, as I recall his
   wordplay is very clever, rivaling some of George Carlin's stuff on the
   absurdities of the English language.  And some of his more elaborate and
   creative props would make Carrot Top go hide in a cave somewhere.  Like the
   massive couch/tramampoline with all the oversized crap tucked in between

>> Take that, Barnes & Noble!

Benjamin Robinson:  Barnes & Noble is a chain of bookstores in the United
   States.  They are large enough to attract authors for speaking and book-
   signing engagements, although Tom Savini would be a little out of their
   scope.


>> Comic nerd powers, activate!

Chad Lehman explains who the "Super-Friends" were:  A Saturday morning cartoon
   show from the 70's & 80's; with Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Captain
   America, & others.  Also a comic book, I believe.  Remember "Wonder Twin
   powers, activate"?


Close, says Jeremy Bleichman, but not quite correct:  Captain America was
   never a Superfriend, since he was a Marvel character, and Superfriends was
   based on DC's characters.  The official line-up was as follows:  Superman,
   Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Wendy (1st series only), Marvin
   (same), Wonderdog (same), Flash, Green Arrow (1 episode only), Plastic Man
   (same), The Wonder Twins Zan and Jayna, Gleek the Space Monkey, Green
   Lantern, Hawkman, Hawkwoman, The Atom, Samurai, Black Vulcan, Apache Chief,
   Rima the Jungle Girl, El Dorado, Firestorm (last 2 seasons only), Cyborg
   (last season only).

>> Where the children run the comic book stores

>> And don't get Moe started on the Susan B. Anthony dollar ...

Benjamin Robinson writes:  Sacagawea was the Lemhi Shoshone woman who guided
   Lewis and Clark on their explanation of the Louisiana Territory.  Nearly
   two hundred years later, her portrait graces the new US$1 coin, which is
   the Mint's latest attempt to wean the US off the paper dollar bill.  The
   coin is more popular than the scene at Moe's tavern suggests, but as a
   souvenir rather than circulating currency.


>> How Do You Say "Loser" In Klingon?

Jeff Cross explains:  Klingon is an actual language, initially formulated by
   linguistics expert Marc Okrand for STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK.  To
   date, there are three books (THE KLINGON DICTIONARY (original and expanded)
   and KLINGON FOR THE GALACTIC TRAVELER), two audio tapes (CONVERSATIONAL
   KLINGON and POWER KLINGON) and the Klingon Language Institute at
   www.kli.org, who took it upon themselves to translate HAMLET into Klingon
   after hearing a throwaway line from David Warner in STAR TREK VI: THE
   UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY.  Unfortunately, there isn't a complete English-to-
   Klingon concordance: according to the KLINGON DICTIONARY, there's no real
   word for "loneliness."  The closest equivalent would be the phrase
   "jImobqu'" (pronounced jhi-mobe-koo), which means "I'm so alone!"  Comic
   Book Guy's attempt of "ghardak" is gibberish.


>> Maybe their "Glenn or Glenda?" comic will be more popular

"twilightman81" writes:  The publishers of "Biclops" in tonight's ep. were
   called "Plan Nine Comics", a reference to the infamous Ed Wood movie "Plan
   Nine from Outer Space", widely considered to be the worst film ever made.
   The name of the company was no doubt a reference to the inevitable failure
   of "Biclops"; however, there is actually a company called "Plan Nine
   Publishing".  It's largely responsible for distributing collections of Web-
   only comics.


["Internet King" asks, "I thought it was published by LensCrafters?"  Good
   question.  The most probable answer is that LensCrafters commissioned Plan
   Nine to develop the book for them -- Ed.]


>> CBG:  Sarcastic Shopkeeper, or Minion of Evil?

"big hungry joe" writes:  CBG is supposed to be *sarcastic*, not *evil* ...
   Sarcasm is his trademark; not destroying things like the kid's boat.  And
   there was very little CBG-quality sarcasm.  Sigh.  Guess that's what
   happens when you overdevelop a character.


"The Doctor of Style" answers:  On what basis do you suggest this?  If you
   noticed his actions in the show we directed against kids.  In previous
   episodes he has always been extremely mean, sinking a toy boat is a very
   small stretch from that.


Steve Alpert:  His voice didn't sound like his, and neither did Agnes'.  The
   characters weren't overdeveloped necessarily, it's just that we see too
   much of them in character.  Neither Agnes nor CBG would do that to kids.
   What Agnes would do is seize the boat controls, while CBG would say "Worst
   piloting ever" or something like that.


"Xit Wound"  [sheesh -- doesn't anyone go by their real name anymore? -- Ed.]:
   CBG has always been evil.  [In "22 Short Films About Springfield (3F18)"]
   Milhouse wanted to use bathroom, made him pay for something, then told Kirk
   that their transaction was complete.


Alex Clock:  Well, there is that scene in the episode (can't remember the name
   of it) ["Lost Our Lisa (5F17)" -- Ed.] that has Lisa getting lost trying to
   go to the Egyptian exhibit where Lisa asks Agnes to sit down beside her on
   the bus and Agnes refuses, saying it is for her coin purse.  When Lisa
   walks away, Agnes picks up her coin purse, leaving the seat vacant again.
   Then Lisa asks to sit down beside Comic Book Guy where he demands she
   "answer these questions 3!".  Two grown adults refusing to let an 8 year
   old girl sit down on a city bus, and they seemed to enjoy it.  Sounds like
   child haters to me!


Steve Alpert rebuts:  Agnes was just being stubborn and CBG was just being
   geeky.  Anyone on the bus would have faced those responses, and they
   weren't out of pure meanness like what we saw last night.


Sean Walsh:  Let's note this "overdeveloped" character doesn't even have a
   given real name ...


big hungry joe, again:  So?  His character's not strong enough to sustain the
   load they've been putting on him recently (and in the newest ep).  Sarcasm
   is frikkin hilarious but you can't be "on" all the time and whereas he used
   to be on, for very short periods, now and in particular in last night's
   show, he is off, for long ones.


"The IRS" observes:  I've always thought of CBG's character a bit like Ugly
   Naked Guy in Friends. He was funny when only given a one-line mention every
   so often, but as soon as you try to attach some personality to a one-
   dimensional background character, the interest leaves.


Chad Lehman:  Seeing that the writers have made CBG into their "internet
   fan/effigy dummy" or "whipping boy", I can understand why they've
   characterized him as mean.  If you'd read some of the absolutely MEAN posts
   back in seasons 8 and 9, personally attacking writers, you'd understand.
   CBG is based on the loudest/meanest of these people -- at least lately.  In
   earlier seasons, he was just a surly, Dungeons & Dragons-type nerd with a
   superiority complex.  It wasn't difficult to go from that, to an A.T.S.
   [alt.tv.simpsons] internet critic characterization.

   And yes, I agree ... developing characters produces more drama than comedy.
   His sarcastic, surly side is a pleasure to watch.  If the writers make him
   more "human", he'll lose his exaggerated, caricature-like persona.


Finally, Rich Bunnell has this theory to explain things:  His sarcasm and
   Agnes' constant anger combined into pure evil.  Or something like that.


>> Worst Urban Legend Forever!

Haynes Lee (I think) writes:  That secret army film about Springfield being
   first on the nuclear strike list reminds me of all those stories during the
   Cold War. It seems everyone says their city is 1st, 2nd, 3rd on the nuclear
   strike list in case the Russkies decide to attack.

   The thing is people said this of cities of dubious strategic importance.
   For example I heard Thunder Bay, Ontario was high on the Russkie list
   because it was a major grain port. That's like saying Hollywood is high on
   the list because the Baldwin brothers live there.


>> Fun with Promotions

Mike Reed faithfully transcribes:

   Voice-Over: Bart runs a risqué business!
   Bart: On your tippy-toes for the adult section.
   (Ralph walks in)
   Ralph: Everyone's hugging!


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Joe Green alterna-title for this show is:  The Dork Knight Returns


According to Fox (by way of Bill LaRue), this episode scored a Nielsen rating
   of 9.8 (15 share).  This works out to 18.5 million viewers.  Among adults
   aged 18 to 49, the rating was 8.9 (21 share).


Don Del Grande:  One of the six "real" "Radioactive Man" issues is #1000, but
   it's dated January 1995 (and has a different cover).


Andrew Levine:  A prognosis is a prediction of the likely future course and
   outcome of a disease.  A diagnosis is a doctor's opinion of the nature and
   cause of a disease.


T. P. Liang:  In an early version of the script, when CBG is buying the box of
   collectibles, it cuts to Martin, who is hospitalized, saying "I sense a
   great disturbance in the force!"

% The family sits down to a pancake breakfast.  Marge departs from her
% usual custom of making things from scratch, and uses one of those
% pancake mixes that come in a squeeze bottle.  There is one drawback
% to this method:  When she squeezes the bottle, it makes an
% unfortunate flatulent sound.  Marge fixes the problem by attaching a
% silencer to the bottle.

Lisa:	You know what would be good with these?  [goes to the 
	fridge, and opens the door] Is some Ms. Butterworth.  
	[reaches for a syrup bottle shaped like a businesswoman]  
	Let's have a breakfast meeting.
	[sees an obviously old box of baking soda in the 
	refrigerator]
	Ew, how long has this box of baking soda been in here?
Marge:	I don't know.  It came with the house.
Bart:	Hey, Dad -- betcha five bucks you can't eat the whole box.
Homer:	Five?  Why don't we make it fifty?  [slaps a $50 bill on 
	the table]  Ooh, you're going to regret this.
Lisa:	I'll call poison control.  [dials phone] Fran, it's me.  
	Just a heads-up.

% Homer looks at spoonful of multicolored powder with anticipation. 
% "Wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals," he says.  Almost
% immediately, Homer is overwhelmed by the flavors of meals past, and
% has some interesting hallucinations.  We hear a sound bite of Johnny
% Cochran's famous "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit" slogan, and
% see a hamburger with fries floating against a techno background of
% computerized numbers.  Nixon's resignation speech accompanies some
% disco music, a mirrored ball and a pie.  Finally, as we hear Neil
% Armstrong take his famous first step on the moon, a meatball
% sandwich bobs above a psychedelic background.  The sandwich starts
% spinning, and we are transported back to the present, where Homer
% lies in a stupor on the kitchen table, with baking soda foaming out
% of his mouth and nostrils.

Lisa:	Uh, oh -- Dad's having an antacid trip.
Bart:	... and I won fifty bucks!  [takes the money and leaves]
-- Trippy, man, "Worst Episode Ever"

% Later, Bart proposes that he and Milhouse goes on a spending spree. 
% Milhouse's doctor won't let him go on sprees, so Bart shifts gears
% and the two go on a spending jag instead.
%
% The boys' $50 grants them exclusive access to the Kwik-E-Mart, with
% Apu as their personal shopper.  They buy so many goodies that they
% sit stuffed in front of the store, unable to move.

Bart:		Oh, too much raw bacon.  [groans]

% The boys are down to their last ten dollars when they see a sign in
% The Android's Dungeon:  "Radioactive Man" #1000 has arrived.

Bart:		Radioactive Man number 1000, please.  [puts the $10 
		on the counter]
CBG:		Ten dollars.  I laugh at you.  Please do note:  This 
		is no ordinary comic book.  It is in perma-mint

		[demonstrates by pouring a can of soda onto the

		How much will you give me for this?

		Oh -- handwritten script for "Star Wars," by George

% Comic Book Guy retaliates by banning the boys from his store for
% life.
%
% Back at home, Homer tries to relate to Bart by talking about his
% first lifetime banning.  The scene dissolves to a Gallagher show. 
% The comedian is about to perform his trademark "Sledge-O-Matic"
% routine.  He swings a sledgehammer and hits ... an empty stool. 
% Then, the hammer recoils and hits Gallagher in the head.  Angry, he
% looks to the audience, where young Homer is eating the watermelon
% that Gallagher intended to hit.
%
% Gallagher throws Homer out of the theater.

Gallagher:	... and you are banned for life from all of my 
		performances, and TV specials!
Homer:		But I can still see your movies, right?

-- Neither did anyone else, "Worst Episode Ever"

% Lisa reads an announcement in "The Daily Set-up."

Lisa:	Ooh, it says here that special effects wiz Tom Savini is 
	going to be appearing at the comic book store tonight.
Homer:	Tom Savini?
Marge:	Yes.  It says here he's the movie magician behind 
	"Creepshow," "Friday the 13th," and "Dawn of the Dead."
Bart:	Oh, I can't believe I'm gonna miss that.
Homer:	Don't worry your spiky little head.  I've got it all 
	planned out.
Bart:	How could you have it planned out?  You just heard about 
	the problem.
Homer:	You're right.  Gimmie a minute.  Hmmm ... [thinks deeply]
-- "Worst Episode Ever"

% The fruit of Homer's planning ability is this:  He, Milhouse, and
% Bart form a human totem pole, with homer on top, and Milhouse
% struggling to walk on the bottom.  Homer wears a long trench coat to
% give the illusion, such as it is, of a tall man.  He identifies
% himself as Shaquille O'Neal.  Comic Book Guy isn't fooled, though,
% whipping off Homer's coat and barring the boys from the store.  CBG
% surreptitiously thanks Homer for the "tip-off," and hands him some
% money.  Homer whispers an apology to the boys before heading into
% the store.
%
% Inside the store, CBG introduces Mr. Savini.

CBG:		Appearing exclusively here at the Android's Dungeon 
		-- take that, Monsieurs Barnes and Noble -- the king 
		of splatter, Tom Savini.
		[audience applauds]
Savini:		Good evening.  [burps] Sorry -- I, I had a really 
		big dinner.
Homer:		[in audience] Woo!  Dinner!
Savini:		But I'm sure one more French fry wouldn't hurt.  
		[eats one, and then blows up like a balloon, until 
		he's several feet in diameter.  Then, he pops, 
		showering the audience with simulated gore.  The 
		audience applauds]
Milhouse:	Oh, we missed the Gut-Buster.
Bart:		Yeah, that should be us covered with blood.
-- "Worst Episode Ever"

% Later, Mr. Savini explains that while computers have made big
% changes in the field, there will always be a place for the practical
% special effects expert.  (That is, someone who works with "real"
% objects and models, rather than virtual ones.)  To demonstrate his
% own special effects mastery, Savini answers this question with his
% head apparently detached from his body.  He picks it up and re-
attaches it, as the audience cheers.  Well, most of the audience.

CBG:	Oh, please.  I saw Paul Lynde do that same hackneyed trick 
	on "Bewitched."  [eats a cookie]  Try to explode this out 
	of my belly.
Savini:	That's not a cookie.  [blood runs out of CBG's mouth]
	It's a time-release blood pack.
	[grossed out, CBG wipes his mouth on his shirt]
	You sir, are a perfect patsy.  Let me shake your hand.  
	[he and CBG shake hands.  Savini's hand pops out of its 
	sleeve]
CBG:	[considering the disembodied hand] The gag I would give a 
	D+.  As for the workmanship on the hand ... [suddenly, the 
	hand comes to life, runs down CBG's back, and gives him a 
	wedgie] Ooh!  That's not right!
	[audience laughs]
	*You* mocking *me*!  Oh, that is rich.  [the hand wedgies 
	him harder, tugging him right off the stage.  He lands on 
	a rack of wizard hats, to of which stick to his chest]
	Stop your laughing!  You're all banned!  [takes the hats 
	off his chest] Banned, I tell you!
	[clutches his chest, and speaks haltingly]  Short of 
	breath ... left arm -- numb ... can't go on ... describing 
	symptoms much longer.  [collapses to the floor]
Savini:	[gasps] I think he's had a heart attack!

% CBG comes to in Springfield General Hospital.  In the hospital room
% with him are Homer, Bart, Milhouse, and Dr. Hibbert, who informs CBG
% that he has suffered a "cardiac episode."

CBG:		Worst episode ever.
Hibbert:	Oh, not even close.  If these boys hadn't called 
		911, I'd be wearing that watch right now.  
		[indicates CBG's watch]
		[chuckles] Just kidding -- but you would be dead.
CBG:		[to Bart] You saved my life?
Bart:		Yeah.  After you were so mean to us.
CBG:		So now we're even.
-- "Worst Episode Ever"

% Dr. Hibbert continues.

Hibbert:	My prognosis -- or is it diagnosis?  Whichever.  You 
		need to avoid stress.  What kind of work do you do?
CBG:		I run a comic book store.
Hibbert:	Oh, dear Lord!  We call that profession, "the widow-
		maker."  Or we would, if any of the proprietors were 
		married.  You should close down the store for a 
		while.
CBG:		But I'd lose all my business to Frodo's of 
		Shelbyville.
Hibbert:	Then get a friend to run it for you.  You do have 
		friends, don't you?
CBG:		Well, the Superfriends.
Hibbert:	You should get some friends who aren't printed on 
		paper.
CBG:		What, you mean action figures?
Milhouse:	We'll run the store for you.
CBG:		Two ten-year-olds running my store.  [stammers] What

% ... right now.  The drawing style shifts back into the "normal"
% mode, and the action resumes where it left off.  Milhouse kicks Bart
% over to a toy shelf.  Bart grabs a transforming robot toy and
% changes it to an ax.  Milhouse grabs another toy, but it transforms
% into a watering can.  He uses it as a weapon anyway.  The two fight
% and fall right through a poster and down a flight of stairs.  It
% turns out the poster was covering a secret entrance to the store's
% basement.  The room is furnished with a chair, a VCR, and a
% television.  Shelves full of videotapes line the walls.

Milhouse:	Whoa, Comic Book Guy's secret stash!
Bart:		Look at all these bootleg videos!
		[reads the labels on a few] "Alien Autopsy."  
		"Illegal Alien Autopsy."  "Godfather III -- Good 
		Version."
Milhouse:	He's got the tape of Kent Brockman picking his nose.  
		[puts it in the VCR and plays it] Look!  He's 
		picking his nose!

% At the Skinner house, CBG waits to pick up Agnes for a date.  He and
% Principal Skinner sit awkwardly in the parlor.  A clock ticks
% loudly.

Agnes:		[from upstairs] I'll be right down.  I'm just 
		putting on my witch hazel.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!
CBG:		So, uh, your mother tells me you go to Springfield 
		Elementary.
Skinner:	Exactly what is your interest in my mother?
CBG:		She makes me laugh.
Agnes:		Here I come.  [appears at the top of the stairs, 
		wearing a 20s flapper outfit, and slides down the 
		banister]
Skinner:	[gasps] Good Lord, Mother, I can see your ... 
		figure.
Agnes:		Oh, you see a lot more when you do my daily mole 
		check.
Skinner:	[aside to Agnes] What I do for my allowance money is 
		nobody's business.  [points to CBG]
Agnes:		He's not nobody.  He might even be your new daddy.  
		[she and CBG laugh.  Skinner looks mortified]

% Bart and Milhouse continue digging into CBG's trove of secret
% videotape.

Milhouse:	[reading tape label] "Police informant video."  
		These are never supposed to leave the station.
		[they play the tape.  It's an interrogation room at 
		the station.  Flanders and Chief Wiggum sit at a 
		table]
Flanders:	I really hate to be a snitch.
Wiggum:		Don't worry.  Your yellow-bellied ratting will be 
		held in the strictest confidence.
Flanders:	Well, in that case, my neighbor Homer released a 
		radioactive ape in my house.  It's, uh, it's taken 
		over the whole top floor.
		[tape ends]
Bart:		It wasn't Dad's fault.  The ape tricked him.  What's 
		next?
Milhouse:	"Mr. Rogers drunk"  [they play that tape]
Mr. Rogers:	[drunkenly] What, what do you mean I can't take off 
		my sweater?  I'm hot!
Milhouse:	You know, I bet kids would pay to see this stuff.  
		We could have a midnight screening right here in the 
		store.
Bart:		[gasps] That's actually a great idea, Milhouse.
Milhouse:	Really?  Well, I was due.
Bart:		I'll say -- partner.

% Homer and Marge are at the Squidport's food court, which offers
% cuisine from all points of the globe.  Or it appears to, anyway. 
% Underneath the court, we can see that all the kiosks are serviced by
% one vat labeled "All-purpose meat."
%
% The Simpsons meet CBG and Agnes, out on their date.  Marge remarks
% that the look "couple-y."  CBG says that they are, indeed, a perfect
% match.
%
% We see CBG's and Agnes's date, as "Puppy Love" plays in the
% background.  They walk past some kids playing in an opened fire
% hydrant.  CBG uses a wrench to turn off the water, and he and Agnes
% walk away, laughing.  CBG skips a stone across the lake, and he and
% Agnes share a good laugh when it sinks a little boy's toy boat. 
% They end a perfect evening by dissing the sunset.
%
% A lot of kids have turned out for the midnight showing of illicit
% videotapes.  Bart puts one in the VCR.

Bart:		I must warn you that once this next tape starts, it 
		will not stop.  Because that button is broken.
Milhouse:	Let's watch.
		[the tape starts.  It's a black-and-white tape of a 
		defense briefing.  A general stands sits at a desk]
General:	If you're watching this tape, you are the President 
		of the United States.  Hello, sir, or ma'am.  
		Hopefully sir.
Bart:		Got that right.  [high-fives Milhouse]
General:	[walks to a map of Springfield] Springfield has been 
		classified "NWB," for "Nuclear Whipping Boy."  In 
		the first moments of a nuclear war, Springfield will 
		be bombed at will by all friendly nations to 
		calibrate their missiles.
		[audience cheers wildly]
		Now for total security, I will terminate the 
		cameraman.  [pulls a pistol, and shoots the 
		cameraman]
Cameraman:	Argh!  Thanks a lot, Steve!  [falls out of camera 
		range]
		[audience laughs]

% Suddenly, the police raid the room.  Some kids try to escape by
% leaping through posters, but none of them cover any secret
% passageways, just parts of the wall.

Wiggum:		Well, well, well.  This place's got more pirated 
		tapes than a ...
Lou:		A Chinese K-Mart?
Wiggum:		Well, that'll have to do.  [to Milhouse] Uh, these 
		yours, son?
Milhouse:	No, sir.  We're just exhibiting them for profit 
		without permission.
Wiggum:		Fair enough.  But the owner is in more hot water 
		than ...
Lou:		A Japanese teabag?
Wiggum:		Why don't you lay off the Asians, Lou?

% Agnes and CBG are going at it hot'n'heavy in his apartment.

CBG:	Well, you changed me, Agnes.  Maybe there is room in my 
	store for romance comics.
Agnes:	Nobody will buy those.  Your store smells.  Now kiss me, 
	funny face.  [they kiss]
	[Wiggum kicks down the door]
Wiggum:	All right -- oh, oh, dear God!  Cover your eyes, boys.
	[Eddie loses it and throws up]
Lou:	[comforting him] It's okay, man.  If it doesn't affect 
	you, you're not human.
Wiggum:	Uh, Comic Book Guy, you're under arrest for the possession 
	of illegal videos.  But we'll reduce your sentence if you 
	put your pants on -- fast.  God!
Lou:	Come on, Romeo.  [handcuffs CBG and takes him out of the 
	room]
CBG:	They can't lock me up for long, Agnes.  Will you wait for 
	me?
Agnes:	Are you crazy?  My bones are half dust!

% Bart and Milhouse walk down the street.

Milhouse:	Well, we may not have the store, but at least we're 
		friends again.
Bart:		Yup.  And, we haven't been to school in days and 
		days and days.
Milhouse:	Well, looks like everything's back to normal.
		[Flanders drives by.  A big, glowing ape is in the 
		passenger's seat.  The ape smacks him on the head]
Flanders:	Look, if you want me to turn, just point.  That-- 
		[the ape smacks him again] Ow!  [Flanders drives 
		turns down a street, contrary to a directional 
		arrow] It's a wrong way!  [smack] Ow!  Now what was 
		that for?  [smack] Ow!  [smack] Ow!  [smack] Ow!
