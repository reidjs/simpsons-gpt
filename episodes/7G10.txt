% floor and present to him Princess Kashmir, Queen of the Mysterious East.
% All the men go wild, apart from Eugene and his father, and Homer, who is
% preoccupied with eating a hoagie.  Eugene and his dad are clearly not
% enjoying the ordeal.
%
% Kashmir has no success enticing Eugene, so Homer is invited to dance with
% her and is pushed up onto the table. (``Go for it Homer!'')
%
% Bart emerges from the Buoys room, hears the hubbub, and pokes his head
% in the door.  He spots Homer tucking money into Princess Kashmir's

   Martin: Who's the sexy lady, Bart?
   Bart:   [hanging up the photo to dry]  Beats me, but the guy dancing with her
           s'my Pop.

   -- ``Homer's Night Out''

% Bart denies requests for a copy, and the kids leave annoyed and
% disappointed.

   Milhouse: Come on Bart.  You're gonna make me a print aren't you?
   Bart:     Will you swear not to let another living soul get a copy of this
             photo?
   Milhouse: Ok.
   Bart:     Cross your heart and hope to die?
   Milhouse: Yup.
   Bart:     Stick a needle in your eye?

% asks Bart why Milhouse gets a copy of his girlie picture but he doesn't.
% Before too long the photo has made its way throughout the entire school.
%
% The father of one of the kids confiscates the photo, and faxes it to one of

   Burns:    His name?
   Smithers: [holding a copy of the incriminating photo]
             Homer Simpson sir, a low-level employee in sector 7G.
   Burns:    Simpson, eh?

% Homer drops by the Kwik-E-Mart, to buy a donut and a Scratch-and-Winticket.
% A copy of Bart's photo is pinned to the wall behind Apu.

   Apu:   You look familiar, sir.  Are you on the television or something?
   Homer: Sorry buddy, you've got me confused with Fred Flintstone.
   -- ``Homer's Night Out''

% Homer scratches the ticket, but his dreams of being a millionaire are foiled
% by that purple fruit thing.  A man greets Homer, but Homer doesn't get it.
% A boy sings ``Do-do Do Do Do, Do-dee Do-dee Do-dee Do'' to the tune of
% the `Arabian Snake Charmer', and Homer answers, ``Well a Do-dee Do Do to
% you too, pintsized.''  Another fellow greets Homer as he leaves the
% convenience store.  (``Wheew, Full moon''), and at the traffic light
% he is recognized by some young women in a sports car (``Huhmm, still
% got it'').  He arrives home and opens the front door...

   Marge: [thrusting a copy of the photograph in his face]
          What is the &lt;meaning&gt; of this!
   Homer: Whyarreeuumpht...  Meaningless!  Marge...  Don't even attempt to find
          meaning in it.  There's nothing between me and Princess Kashmir!
   Marge: Princess &lt;who&gt;?
   Bart:  [wanders by] Hey, my photo!
   Homer+Marge:  &lt;Your photo!&gt;
   Bart:  Uh-oh.
   Homer: Why you little...  [steps towards Bart]
   Marge: [grabs Homer's neck] Why you big...
          Bart!  Go to your room!
   Bart:  I'm outta here...
   -- ``Homer's Night Out''

   Homer: Look, Marge... Honey... Baby... Doll...
   Marge: [turning her back, folding her arms]  Homer, I don't even want to look
          at you right now.
   Homer: What are you saying, honey?  [Marge points him outside]  But where will
          I sleep?
   Marge: [shaking angrily] My suggestion is you sleep in the filth you created!
   Homer: Will a motel be okay? [Marge slams the front door in his face]
   -- Shall I take that as a yes?  ``Homer's Night Out''

% Homer heads dejectedly for the car.  The door opens, and Homer is relieved
% that Marge is taking him back.  He is greeted in the face with a half-packed
% suitcase of clothes.  Marge hands him a box of tissues.  ``If you have any
% soul left, you'll need these.  I know I will.''  Homer sits sadly on the
% front lawn.

          not even checking out the action.
   Homer: Oh Moe, my wife gave me the ol' heave-ho because of some lousy picture.
   Moe:   [pointing to a copy behind him]  What, this one?
   Homer: D'oh!
   -- ``Homer's Night Out''

% When Homer says he'll spend the night in a motel, Barney insists, ``No pal
% of mine is going to stay in some dingy flop house!''
%
% The two of them return to Barney's dingy flop-house.  Strewn everywhere is
% clear evidence that Barney is still a bachelor.

   If you get hungry in the middle of the night, there's a open beer in
   the fridge.
   -- Barney Gumbel, your gracious host, ``Homer's Night Out''

% Homer goes to the window.

   Homer:  Look Barney, see the row of tiny lights up there?  The middle one is
           my house.  Someone must've left the porch light on.
   Barney: Hey, that's rough pal. [using the phone]  Hello, Marge?  You left
           your damned porch light on!  Homer isn't made of money you know!
   -- ``Homer's Night Out''

% Marge quickly hangs up when she hears Homer's protesting voice.
% Barney suggests that Homer is overwrought and needs to unwind.

   There's a party down the hall.  You know this apartment complex
   really caters to up-scale singles like me.  [belch]
   -- Barney Gumbel, your gracious host, ``Homer's Night Out''

% Homer declines the offer and spends an uncomfortable night on a
% fold-out couch, while the party down the hall rocks on.
%
% The next morning Marge and the kids sit at the kitchen table, silently
% eating breakfast.  Lisa whispers to Bart, ``I wonder when Dad's coming
% home?''  Marge stares sadly.
%
% At work, an exhausted Homer drinks straight from the coffeepot.  The PA
% system orders him to Mr. Burn's office.

   Burns: What in blue-blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson?
   Homer: What do you mean, sir?
   Burns: [showing Homer the photo]  I mean this!  [Homer gasps]  A plant
          employee carrying on like a over-sexed orangutan in heat!  This is a
          &lt;family&gt; nuclear power plant, Simpson.  Our research indicates that
          over fifty percent of our power is used by &lt;women&gt;.
   -- Read my lips:  No rude faxes! ``Homer's Night Out''

% Homer promises that it will not happen again.  Burns sends Smithers out,
% then changes his demeanor.

   Burns: [sadly]  Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man.  I have
          wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk.
          And yet, I've led a solitary life.  The fair sex remains a mystery to
          me.  You seem to have a way with women, [gets up and stares out
          his window] a certain, how should I put it... Animal magneteasmuh [sic].
          [begging] Help me Simpson, tell me your secret.
   Homer: Uh, Mister Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no loverboy.
   Burns: [pleasantly]  Simpson, I'm asking you nicely...
   Homer: I don't really know, sir.
   Burns: &lt;Simpson!&gt;
   Homer: Well oh, wine 'em... Dine 'em...
   Burns: [listens attentively]
   Homer: Bring them flowers..  Write them love poetry... sir.
   Burns: Of course!  It's simplicity itself!  I won't forget this Simpson.
          [angrily]  Now return to your work!... and tell no one of what
          transpired here.
   -- It'll be our little secret, ``Homer's Night Out''

% Homer returns home and is greeted warmly but quietly by his three children.
% Bart wishes Homer luck with Marge.
%
% Homer enters the kitchen.  Marge is sitting at the table.

   Homer: Hello Marge?  It's me, Homer.  Are you still mad?
   Marge: [continues scowling]
   Homer: You &lt;are&gt; still mad.  Don't need to say it, I'm your loving husband, I
          can read you like a book. [goes to the fridge]  I'll just have some
          milk. [using a glass]  Look!  I'm not drinking out of the carton!
          [breaks down]  Come on Marge!  Please forgive me! [goes down on his
          knees]  I'm sorry! I'm so sorry...
   Marge: [with contempt]  Homer, you don't even know why you're apologizing.
   Homer: Yes, I do.  Because I'm hungry, my clothes are smelly, and I'm tired.
   -- ``Homer's Night Out''

   Marge: You taught Bart a very bad lesson.  Your boy idolizes you.
   Homer: Oh, he does not.
   -- ``Homer's Night Out''

% Marge insists that he take Bart to ``to meet this exotic belly-person.
% I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and
% real feelings.  I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated
% her.''
%
% Homer drags Bart along to ``Florence of Arabia'', where the usher points
% him to the Girlesque.  Bart catches a glimpse of one of the dancers,before
% Homer yanks him away by the arm.  At the Girlesque, the attendant redirects
% Homer to Foxy Boxing.  At Foxy Boxing, Bart's view of the action is
% blocked by the paunches of Homer and the portly bouncer.  Next stop is
% Mud City...  Homer phones Marge to tell her he's trying one last place,
% ``The Sapphire Lounge.''  (``Bart!  I said look at the floor!'')
%
% Backstage at the Sapphire Lounge, they finally locate Princess Kashmir.

   Homer:   Hey Princess!  It's me!  The guy from the snap shot!
   Kashmir: [not very enthusiastically]  Oh, hi.
   Homer:   Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an
            object.
   Kashmir: Uh-huh.
   Homer:   I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly.
            I want to meet the woman behind all the
            spangles and glitter, and find out that she has thought and feelings
            too.
   Kashmir: Uh, oh, okay, but can we make it quick?
   Bart:    Nice to meet you ma'am.  [waves]
   Homer:   Could you tell him a little about yourself?
   Kashmir: Well, um, my real name is Shauna Tifton, my pet peeve is rude
            people, and my turn-ons include silk sheets and a warm fireplace.
   -- ``Homer's Night Out''

% During Shauna's brief profile, the cage she sits in slowly rises.  Homer
% rises with it.  Homer turns to leave and falls.  He hangs on for dear life.
%
% As the male entertainer begins his song, Shauna tries to shoo Homer out
% of her cage.  The performance proceeds with the curtains drawing back to
% reveal row upon row of scantly-clad women of all nations.
%
% Homer finally loses his grip, falling and bouncing across the stage.
% The singer eventually recognizes Homer and invites him to join the act.
% Monty Burns and Smithers are in the audience (with respective dates).

   Burns:    How does he do it, Smithers?
   Smithers: He's a love machine, sir.
   -- ``Homer's Night Out''

% Homer gets into the swing of things, then sees Bart looking on in
% admiration.  ``Uh-oh.''  He stops the music and asks to have a word.
% A tall beehive hairdo rises.  (``Burns: ``You with the hair!
% Down in front!'')  Marge sighs, ``Oh no, he's sunk even lower...''

   I have something to say to all the sons out there.  To all the boys,
   to all the men, to all of us.  It's about women, and how they are not
   mere objects with curves that make us crazy.  No, they are our wives,
   they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our
   nieces and nephews---well, not our nephews.
   -- Homer, ``Homer's Night Out''

% His monologue touches everyone in the audience.  The singer phones his
% mother, and the men in the audience muse on their wives and children.
%
