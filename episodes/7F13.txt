> Title sequence
===============================================================================
Blackboard :- `I will not make flatulent / noises in class'.
              `I will not make flatule' at cutoff.

Driveway   :- no oil on the driveway.
              Homer does not shake his fist at Bart.
              Homer says `D'oh!' when Lisa scoots past.

Couch:     :- The family does a little dance.

===============================================================================
> Didja notice ...
===============================================================================

 ... Ned said, `D'oh!'? [Bryant S Liu (bliu@cbnewsf.att.com)]
     (Though it wasn't said in the same way.)
 ... the cable installer's pants were slung low, revealing his rear cleavage?
     (A sketch based on this phenomenon got SNL into trouble.  Ah, how
      times have changed.)
 ... we hear a snippet from `Davey and Goliath'?
 ... Bart's hair was combed down and Lisa was wearing an adorable Sunday hat?
 ... Marge was wearing lipstick in the car on the way home from church?
     (In some circles, wearing makeup to church is considered unethical.)
     [Dave Hall (dave@sys6626.bison.mb.ca)]
 ... Dr. Nick Riviera reappears?
 ... a shopping cart was rolling out of the supermarket parking lot?
 ... Maggie is tossing things into the shopping cart?  (And when Lisa
     yells, `Thou shalt not steal!', Maggie drops a glass jar?)
 ... when Homer hears about `The bout to knock the other guy out',
     he stands up in excitement, and Lisa (who had been seated on his knee)
     falls to the floor as a result?  (Poor Lisa.)
 ... while Homer is buying a Crate-O-Duff's at the Qwik-E-Mart, Jimbo
     is in the background shoplifting?  He was also shoplifting at the
     supermarket.
 ... the signs in the store say `Eat more often' and `Buy and buy again'?
 ... the wonderful Mike Tyson/Don King spoof?
 ... Mr. Burns says, ``"Ah, Simpson, I was just in the neighborhood'' to
     Barney?  This is a new low in Burns' being unable to recognize his
     employees. [Mike Dolny (6500poln%ucsbuxa@hub.ucsb.edu)]
 ... many assorted TV voices were supplied by Phil Hartman?
 ... the fight announcer is the same one from the golf tournament? [Jym Dyer]
 ... when Homer panics and collects the things he `borrowed' from work,
     one of the things he hands to Bart is a computer?  (Looks like a
     monitor and keyboard.) {cjb}

Dave Hall's Maggie fall count:
    1.  When the family comes in with the groceries.
    2.  When walking towards the TV.
    3.  When Marge hands Lisa a glass of lemonade.
    4.  At the very end, when the family walks out onto the front yard to
        watch Homer cut the cable.  (It happens very fast and there's no
        sound effect.)

===============================================================================
> Cable TV
===============================================================================
>> Notable things on cable:

- Cable shopping channel, selling `poopsie the clown'.

- `Lemondade?'  `Please.' from `Porch Pals'?  This is the cartoon that
   was created as a result of Marge's protest against cartoon violence
   in `Itchy and Scratchy and Marge'.  (The protest was in I&S&M, not
   the violence.)  Note also that the cartoon was cut for cable.

- `I used to be poor like you!' from Tommy Vu's real estate
   program-length advertisements. [Dale Gass]

- The stand-up comedian who sounded a lot like Jerry Seinfeld.
  [Ken Staggers]

>> What's the point?

st883045@pip.cc.brandeis.edu:

I think the message that MG was trying to convey is that cable will show just
about ANYTHING. "Porch Pals" was rejected by dozens (maybe hundreds) of kids,
but cable shows it. I don't think I need to say much about Tommy Vu.

BTW I freeze-framed the Top Hat channel and what I saw behind Homer's leg
was something that looked vaguely like two roman columns with a red curtain
hanging between them. Not too exciting.

>> Homer's TV habits

amehrer@misvax.mis.arizona.edu (Annette):

Watch the plant next to the couch during that scene.   Marge had
brought the plant into the living room earlier in the show--it was just a
wee sprout.  During the scene in question, the plant grows and grows and
then wilts and dies.  This would indicate that the scene actually took
place over months, which is supported also by the deep imprint of Homer's
body on the couch when he (finally?) gets up.

===============================================================================
> The Boxing Match
===============================================================================
rmm@hydra.ipac.caltech.edu (Mike Melnyk):

Clearly, the challenger, Dreaderick Tatum, is a caricature of Mike Tyson,

stx7226@uoft02.utoledo.edu (Janet Healey):

The other boxer (Watson) is obviously James "Buster" Douglas.  He is the boxer
who whoopped Tyson's butt and then dedicated the fight to his mother who had
died two weeks (or so) before the fight.

===============================================================================
> Other stuff
===============================================================================
jimi@cbnewsm.att.com (james.d.wynn):

Was Barney driving a Miata to Homer's house to watch the fight?
The vehicle was blue but not the Miata mild dark blue...BUT  Barney's head
and the size of the interior were about the right ratio for it to be a Mazda.

===============================================================================
staggers@casbah.acns.nwu.edu (Ken Staggers):

I thought this episode REALLY stood out because of the ACTING!  Yes,
the acting..which translates into the director and the animators.  The fact
that Homer's head was bobbing up and down with an incredible sarcastic grin
made the line "Nothing a month...yeah, I think we can swing that" HYSTERICAL.

Also, when they were showing the program length commercial, the lady on
stage had great body movement..which made her line sound SO phony (which is
the way everyone on plc's sound)

[And the scene change when Lisa turns her head, and the background dissolves
 to the car on the way home. --rjc]

Did you notice Bart pushing his hair back up when he got back to the
couch to watch cable?

===============================================================================
Chris Baird observes that, during the biblical flashback, if you
shaved off the beards and ignored the accents:

        the carver of graven images ==> Rev. Lovejoy (maybe)
        the adulterer               ==> Jacques

The Carver's nose is different, so maybe there is no connection there.

And when Bart is showing the X-rated channel to his friends, the American spy
from 'Crepes of Wrath' was sitting next to Wendell.

===============================================================================
> Freeze Frame Fun
===============================================================================
David S. Berger (dsberger@pisces.rutgers.edu) carefully slo-mo'd the Simpsons
Shuffle, and here's what he reports:

Right after the Simpson's jumped on the couch the couch fell through the
floor!  This only lasted one cartoon frame (1/24 or 1/30 sec ?).  I watched
this scene one more time at normal speed, looking for evidence of the event,
but there was none.  there was absolutely no evidence that this event ever
took place.  To see this gag, you had to watch it with a VCR.

===============================================================================
Dave Hall's astute eyes report...

In the opening scene, while Homer (the Thief) is talking to Azran (Carver of
Graven Images), a person behind Homer strikes another person down. (What
other sins were commited during this scene?)  [I saw a man struggling with
a woman. --rjc]

The cable guy leaves his(?) ladder behind in Flanders yard.

The Cable guy's truck plate number is 1NBNW.

Santa's Little Helper (SLH) `sort of' glares at the cable guy's rear-end.

The T.V. depicted on the pamphlet appears to be the same T.V. shown in the
opening credits. (Even the Channel nobs are in the same position.)

The ``Hear Me Roar: Network for Women'' host wears knee-high boots.

While the family is watching T.V., Maggie and Snowball (II) are sleeping
on SLH.

While Homer's alone watching T.V., SLH appears to have a rather long nose.

Homer's pajama buttons are on the wrong side. (Tell me if I'm wrong, but
shouldn't buttons be on the right side of shirts/pajamas?)  [Men's buttons
are on the right; women's on the left. Does this mean Homer is a
cross-dresser? --rjc]

When Homer gets ready for Church, he shoves the T.V. remote into the
couch, which appears later (when the family comes back) on the armrest.

In Sunday School, Millhouse appears to be the only kid not wearing socks.

The lady with the "Madonna" type hair-do just behind the cashier.

The "Caution: Looking into laser..." sign on the cash register. (I couldn't
read the rest.)

When Homer installed bars around the house, it appears that the Tree house
also has bars. (This is debatable.)

The "No Thieves" sign planted in the front yard.

In Homer's panic sequence, his prison number is 7734.
    [Daniel S. Lewart (d-lewart@uiuc.edu) brilliantly suggests that
     you punch `7734' into a calculator and turn it upside-down.]

===============================================================================
> Which is the 8th Commandment? and other religious questions
===============================================================================
dattier@ddsw1.MCS.COM (David W. Tamkin):

The Douay Bible's numbering, followed by many Roman Catholics, skips
"Remember the Sabbath day" and divides "Thou shalt not covet" into two
parts to make ten again.  For Catholics who follow the Douay enumeration,
"Thou shalt not steal" is seventh.

For other Christians and for Jews, "Thou shalt not steal" is eighth.

Groening is of Dutch ancestry, so it's not surprising that he used the
Protestant numbering.

===============================================================================
Here are the most commonly-encountered Judaic, Protestant and Catholic
numberings.  Note that the choice of words depends on what translation
you use.  (Exodus 20:1--17 and Deuteronomy 5:6--21)

Jud.  Prot. Cath.
====  ====  ====
 1     1     1   I am the Lord your God.
 2     "     "   Thou shalt have no other God before me.
 "     2     "   Thou shalt not make graven images.
 3     3     2   Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain.
 4     4     3   Remember to keep holy the Sabbath.
 5     5     4   Honor thy Father and thy Mother.
 6     6     5   Thou shalt not kill.
 7     7     6   Thou shalt not commit adultery.
 8     8     7   Thou shalt not steal.
 9     9     8   Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
10    10     9   Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.
 "     "    10   Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods.

===============================================================================
rsteele@xn.ll.mit.edu (Rob Steele):

I can't tell whether MG intends Miss Sunday School Teacher to be a heretic
but, for the record, she is.  The orthodox answer to Martin's question about
how to avoid damnation is, roughly, believe the truth.  That is, no one can
possibly obey the ten commandments well enough to deserve heaven but "God so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in
him should not perish, but have eternal life." (John 3:16)

This is not a controversial doctrine in most churches.  It certainly would not
be in Springfield Vanilla Baptist or Punchclock Presbyterian.  It would not be
suprising though to find a well-intentioned but misguided sunday school
teacher who believed in "salvation by works," ie., that integrity or some
particular act or level of obedience are what God requires.

MG ridicules many cultural phenomena and is clearly doing so in the character
of the sunday school teacher.  But what phenomena precisely?  I think it's
just small-town, old-time, middle-American moral do-goodyness, an easy target.

   ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''

% ... before opening the door.  Moe's gift is a mug from the tavern.
% He then seems Burns and Smithers coming up the walk.

Homer: Quick, Bart!  Hide the stuff I borrowed from work!
Bart:  Borrowed?
Homer: All, right, that stuff I stole from work.
-- Panicking when Mr. Burns arrives, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''

Will you quit staring at me like that!?
-- Homer to Lisa who is staring innocently at Homer from outside,
   ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''

% Burns arrives and gives Homer `some munchies', a tiny bag of Cheetos.
% Burns' appearance scares some of Homer's guests.  The next visitors are
% the two cops.

Cop:   Word on the street is that you have an illegal cable hookup.
Homer: No!  No, I... It wasn't me.  It was my wife.  My wife's idea.
       Yeah, yeah, ...
-- ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''

% ... but they just want to watch the fight, too.  Outside, Marge brings
% Lisa some lemonade and moral support.

When you love somebody, you have to have faith that in the end,
they will do the right thing.
-- Marge to Lisa, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''

% The pre-fight hype profiles Dreaderick Tatum...

Announcer: The challenger learned how to fight in the notorious province[?]
           of Capital City, and honed his skills while serving time for
           aggravated assault and manslaughter in Springfield Prison.
Barney:    Awright!  A local boy!
Tatum:     For five years, I was incarcerated, away from my family, and
           the mothers [sic] of my children...
-- Watching the pre-fight hype, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''

% Hearing the list of charges against Tatum gives Homer the willies, and
% he envisions himself in jail, isolated from his family.  (He calls,
% ``Marge!  Lisa!  Maggie!''  Bart is conspicuously missing.)  As the
% fight begins, he drags Bart outside.

I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know that
I've made a couple of really important decisions.
Number 1: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over, and
Number 2: I'm not very fond of any of you.
-- Homer, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''

Lisa:  Dad, we may have saved your soul.
Announcer: [from the TV inside] Tatum is reeling from the champ's
           exquisite hailing...
Homer: Yeah, at the worst possible time!
-- Cutting the cable hook-up, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''

% Tatum wins the fight by knockout, and the guests file out.

Apu:   What a donnybrook, eh, Mr. Burns?
Burns: Oh, hogwash!  Why, I once watched Gentleman Jim Corbett
       fight an Eskimo fellow bare-knuckled for a hundred and thirteen
       rounds!  Back then, of course, if the fight lasted less than
       fifty rounds, we demanded our nickel back!
-- After watching the big fight, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''

% Later that evening, Homer takes the cable clippers and prepares to
% climb the utility pole.

Dad, I beg you to reconsider.
Tractor pulls.  Atlanta Braves baseball.  Joe Franklin!
-- Bart begs Homer not to cut the cable hook-up,
   ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''

% Homer reaches the top, and cuts a wire.  Half the lights in Springfield
% go out.  He cuts another wire, and the other half of the lights go out.
% ``Third time's a charm.''  Snip.  Cut to static.
