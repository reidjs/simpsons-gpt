                I WIL ONLY PROVI                                 at cutoff

Couch:          Santa's Little Helper dances in front of the couch, just like
                Snoopy does on the "Peanuts" TV cartoons, to music that's
                similar to that played on the Christmas special.  The Simpsons
                run in and stare at him incredulously.  The sudden attention
                makes SLH self-conscious, and he stops.

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... the frog in the lava lamp on the island master's desk?
   ... Homer's un-obscured face briefly appears as the Mr. X web page loads?

Steve Alpert:
   ... Carl and Lenny have a new car and appear quite wealthy compared to
       Homer on presumably the same salary?
   ... Homer has learned Mr. Burns's first (middle) name?
   ... Apu's mustache isn't ripped off by the tape?
   ... the police dog CLEARLY has Homer's voice?
   ... the lava lamp contains a dead frog?

Don Del Grande:
   ... "Honest John's Computers" uses a recycled tire-company logo?
   ... Lisa doesn't let anybody else use her E-mail account?  (Otherwise, why
       didn't Burns send Homer a message there?)
   ... Homer and the Comic Book Guy apparently bought Mac clones? (Besides the
       window images, Lisa turned off Homer's computer by pressing a keyboard
       key)
   ... Homer types with his index fingers?
   ... there's a Channel 10 news van at the Mayor's office in addition to a
       Channel 6 van?
   ... "pothole cement" was being used at the pool?
   ... Mr. Burns uses the same bathroom as "the common employee"?
   ... when Homer first arrived at The Island, nobody was wearing numbers?
   ... either Patrick McGoohan didn't voice Number 6, or his voice has
       seriously changed since 1968 (when the original was filmed)?
   ... at The Island, they play croquet American style (rounded wickets,
       hitting the ball like a golf ball rather than between the legs)?

Ahmet Deligonul:
   ... this is the 4th episode which had Homer using a computer ending up into
       trouble?  (Think about the others ...)
   ... Lisa knows how to set up a computer at her grade level?  (In 4th grade
       I could barely type.)
   ... Homer has access to a scanner, digital camera or some way of getting
       his face on the computer?
   ... Bart doesn't care about Homer spilling Springfield gossip, or show an
       interest, even though he ran that pirate radio station with the same
       type of info?
   ... the German Homer knew enough about Homer to carry the charade on for 4
       months?  [Actually 3.5 months.  Homer #2 mentioned being absent for two
       weeks -- Ed.]

Ben Fonter:
   ... while in his car, Carl says "Anything goes today"?  (Maybe this is
       foreshadowing of the following episode.)
   ... Bart is able to tackle Homer?  Twice?
   ... Bart is in serious need of therapy?  (Where's Dr. Marvin Monroe when
       you need him?  Dead.  That's where.  Hehehe)
   ... Marge does not come downstairs to investigate the loud crashing sound
       of the tire through the front window?
   ... Apu makes no reaction to Krusty's startling confession?
   ... that the bloodhound's barks bubble out and then die?

Joe Green:
   ... the person Moe keeps in the basement sounds like Hans Moleman?

Darrel Jones:
   ... the guy in charge of "the island" mentions flu shots are always
       delivered shortly before Christmastime, which is also when this episode
       first aired?

Joe Klemm:
   ... Homer's computer, with the boot-up sound, is a Macintosh?
   ... when Mr. X is named the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Nelson doesn't
       cheer?
   ... the dunking bird in the Island head's office?

Ryan Mead:
   ... SLH tries to eat the Pulitzer once Homer gives it to him?

Perri Mongan:
   ... the CPU of Homer's computer strongly resembles a G3 (blue and white) or
       G4?  Note the curved handles.  Um, but it shouldn't be lain on its
       side.
   ... that's a Mac startup sound, as heard on the Quadra series?
   ... the web browser has a Mac interface (note the window bar and placement
       of the close and expand boxes)?
   ... the sound file on Homer's copyright-violating home page is a Mac beep
       called "Sosumi" ("so sue me", allegedly a reaction to Apple Records'
       lawsuit against Apple Computers)?

Mike Reed:
   ... Homer knows how stupid he is?
   ... Lenny can afford the internet?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... "Honest John's" crudely modified sign?
   ... since Homer presses "Send" to reveal the news about Burns and the
       uranium, he must be e-mailing it to someone, in addition to putting it
       on his site?
   ... the aquarium-couch, with live fish, in the prisoners' gathering room?
   ... Marge apparently (without knowing it) made love to someone other than
       her husband for three and a half months?

Hari M. Wierny:
   ... Homer looks at the keyboard as he types?
   ... Mayor Quimby's bodyguard cowers away from the reporters?
   ... Bart leaves his skateboard outside the Kwik-E-Mart?

+  Lenny was poor in 5F06, he shouldn't be able to have a computer.  {mr2}

*  It sounds like they sent the plant closure e-mail to everyone's home,
   rather than work address.  (And if they did send it to their work
   addresses, how come Homer hasn't been assigned one?)  {bjr}

+  OFF has at least two computers at home -- the one in Lisa's room (unless it
   got destroyed in "Lisa The Treehugger" when Homer used the firecrackers in
   the VCR) and the laptop in "A Tale Of Two Springfields."  {dld}

+  ... and they also already have the Internet.  {dld}

*  Why didn't Homer use Lisa's computer to get his e-mail?  [Jessie Cook
   answers, "Because Lisa probably has her computer password protected with
   the highest level encryption possible to prevent that.  Would you want
   Homer touching your computer?" -- Ed.]  {jk}

-  The store has a big metal door on the outside but not on the corresponding
   wall inside.  {mm}

+  Homer brought home a different computer than he bought.  {ds}

*  Lisa manages to carry a CPU case, monitor, and keyboard all at once and
   without any help.  {ad}

*  Homer's computer starts up and is on-line in a matter of seconds.  {mm}

*  How are these pages coming to Homer's attention?  They seem to be coming
   *to* him rather than him having to find them.  {mm}

=  When Homer enters his URL to show the family his page, all the keys he
   types are function keys, control keys, and numeric keypad keys; no letters.
   {mm}

*  The title on Homer's page [...] gets retyped in real-time rather than Homer
   having to edit the source code and then reload it.  {mm}

*  The fact that Homer visited his site after the counter was installed should
   guarantee one hit, yet it is on 0000.  {hmw}

+  Near the new pool, there is a guy with the words "City Worker" on the back
   of his blue shirt putting finishing touches on a statue.  He is using
   cement from a bag labeled  POTHOLE CEMENT.  Later, when we see people
   repairing the pothole, they are wearing orange jump suits, and the stuff
   they are filling the hole with is most definitely tar.  {bf}

*  Cement is not used in potholes.  {bf}

+  Agnes Skinner either wants her son to be ogling naked women, or is
   surprised he isn't, either of which would be uncharacteristic of her?  {dj}

*  Burns and Smithers don't use the executive washroom.  {bjr}

=  Burns wipes the underside of his fingers on his trousers, but the soap
   comes off the unwiped side.  {hmw}

*  The terrorist carelessly handles the *Radioactive* uranium?  {bf}

*  They never mention in what category Homer won the Pulitzer Prize.  {ddg}

*  Mrs. Krabappel's voice was way, WAY off.  {mr2}

*  Real web counters don't go down -- they're a count of how many people have
   visited the site, not how many are on at one time.  {ddg}

*  Hit counters don't update in real time.  {bjr}

+  Moe can't keep a secret, yet he has many disturbing ones.  {sa}

-  One of the Squishee machines behind Apu in at least the fake Kwik-E-Mart is
   labeled "green" and is distinctly yellow.  {jm}

*  "Please send lots of rescue 'copters to ..." ... where?  Even assuming he
   had someone who could help him on the other end of the line, how would he
   described the location?  {mm}

*  When fake Homer is shaving his head why aren't the Homer parts of the hair
   being shaved?  Is he carefully shaving around them?  Wouldn't that mean
   that the stubble underneath them isn't getting shaved?  {mm}

=  Also why isn't the stubble that is being shaved going away?  {mm}

*  Obvious goof here: the guy can't see through the computer.  ["Maybe the
   other Homer installed a small camera somewhere," rebuts Jessie Cook]  {sa}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Steve Alpert:  If I hadn't learned of this ["Prisoner"] reference, I would
   have thought the show returned to its past antics.  Now I see it as
   possibly a cop out, but the episode remains strong in my mind.  Several
   laughers toward the end (a bit too much time spent on plot development
   though), and I'm getting tired of all these Homer-centric episodes.  At
   least he's returned to the same stupid Homer he's always been (although the
   remark "I'm stupid" was definitely pointless.)  (B+)

Stephen Burks:  This episode really felt like something out of season 9.
   Well, I thought that until about the last 5 or so minutes when the episode
   turned into the bizarre farce that the Simpsons have become over the last
   season. But, there were several nice laughs (I think I laughed out loud
   more times than the entire other episodes of this season combined) and a
   plot that, while strange, was still developed up to my liking ...  An all
   around decent episode to watch.  Anyhow, I will give this one a  (B+)

Don Del Grande:  B-plus if you're a computer geek and a fan of "The Prisoner"
   like I am (seriously, I've been to Portmerion, in Wales, where the show was
   filmed -- the "green dome" was turning brown, and it was in the middle of a
   train strike, but that's a different story); B if you're one but not the
   other; B-minus if, like most people watching, you're neither.  The show had
   its moments, but there were far too many "inside information" jokes (the
   emoticon one and pretty much the entire Prisoner bit), and even if you knew
   what they were talking about, the ending joke was a bit weak (even if
   having everybody end up on The Island was a nice twist).  (B+)

Ahmet Deligonul:  This episode was good all the way up till the part where
   Homer revealed that he was Mr. X ... Then it wasn't as funny anymore.
   Ending up on the island made it seem confusing ... When will they start
   writing episodes that make sense for 21 minutes again?  (D)

Ryan Glanzer:  It was a pretty good episode, all in all.  I would give it a B.
   While the whole Internet part was funny, I think they could have done
   without that whole island part.  It was like 2 entirely different stories
   in one episode both involving Homer--his gabbing about Springfieldians and
   also trying to escape from an island.  And what is it with animals all of a
   sudden--the koalas in this episode, the pandas twice before, the badgers
   ...  (B)

Joe Green:  My favorite Season 12 episode to date, due to both the timely
   subject matter and the fact that it was more consistently funny than most
   OFF shows these days.  As was the case with "Brother's Little Helper", I
   can't decide if the ending was a stroke of absurdist genius or just stupid.
   (A)

Darrel Jones:  This is the second week in a row in which "Futurama" had a much
   better episode than OFF's.  Actually, this one got off to a hilarious
   start. (Dancing Jesus?  ROFL!), but went downhill after Homer was
   kidnapped.  The whole "island" thing was too surreal for me; I didn't have
   the slightest idea what was going on.  Homer's escape was nice, actually,
   but the ending ruined it for me.  I give this a measly "seven thumbs up" or
   7/10  (C+)

Kevin Lilley:  I found the first two segments of this episode to be very
   funny, especially with how Homer got his secrets from all the townspeople.
   The scene where Homer drops the notepad and then Mr. Burns put it back
   caught me by surprise, and made me chuckle.  Though it had its moments,
   this episode never really did make me laugh out loud.  All in all, the
   parody of "The Prisoner" was nice, but the episode lacked in certain areas
   and did not completely deliver.  (C+)

Michael Nusair:  This was an okay episode, with a very bizarre third act.
   What the hell was *that* all about?  The German replacement Homer was
   pretty funny, though.  While this episode had its share of laughs, it just
   doesn't stick out in my mind as a very good episode.  The strange third act
   probably didn't help.  It was nowhere near as bad as something like the
   Jockey Trolls, but I still could have done without it.  And what was with
   that ending?  Note to the writers:  At the end of the episode, everything
   should be wrapped up in a nice, neat little package.  (C+)

Mike Reed:  After three consecutive bad efforts, John Swartzwelder had seemed
   to bring himself up, this episode was very funny and had lots of good
   jokes.  (Homer realizing his own stupidity, his first website, and the
   Spanish/Italian bit come to mind.)  But, after Homer was kidnapped the
   episode took a huge enough dive to make it one of the worst episodes ever,
   IMHO.  In the past three seasons, Swartzwelder has only produced one decent
   episode.  (BABF05) Episodes like these make me maintain my belief that we
   need more new writers.  (C-)

Hari M. Wierny:  This episode started off well -- <really> well, and I believe
   it could have became a <very> memorable episode.  But instead, John
   Swartzwelder decided to ruin the great first two acts by making the third
   act so hebetudinous I couldn't even watch it again.  It wasn't funny -- it
   was ridiculous.  I don't see why he did that.  Making the Simpsons isn't a
   game of annoying the Internet fans while still appealing to little kids by
   being wacky -- but that's the game the writers seem to be playing.  I also
   found Todd saying "mom-my?" very tasteless.  (D)

Todd Willis:  I thought this episode was pretty good.  The first couple acts
   were about average, but the third act with the parody of The Prisoner was
   just plain awesome.  I thought the way they handled the rumors and Homer's
   website was nicely done.  They luckily didn't take this episode to the
   crazy degree that they could have.  I guess the main problem with this
   episode was a weak and unoriginal story plot.  All in all, this was a
   decent episode with some nice moments.  (B)

Yours Truly:  It's two, two, two episodes in one!  The first one was better.
   Homer's initial forays into the Internet rang true and were funny, to boot.
   The concept of Homer the muckraker is a promising one, and there's a good
   fable here on how Internet to grants authority to people who don't entirely
   deserve it.  Alas, we don't get to see it because the third act diverges
   wildly into a parody of "The Prisoner."  The conclusion wasn't as
   satisfying as the first two acts, mainly because I felt as though I'd been
   drugged and taken to some surreal new place myself.  It wasn't unfunny, but
   it was *too* much of a surprise for the show's own good.  (B)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B- (2.82)   Std Dev.: 0.8501   (20 reviews computed)

==============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Does this compute?

Benjamin Robinson:  Among his other sins, "Honest John" is probably guilty of
   price inflation.  Thanks to the relentless downward march in the prices of
   electronic components, even high-end machinery is more affordable than it
   was just three years ago.  For instance, Circuit City is advertising a 1.4
   GHz Pentium IV-based Hewlett-Packard for US$2200. CompUSA is offering a 1
   GHz Athlon-based HP for US$1100.  Both machines need a monitor to make them
   useful, but a good monitor is a sub-$500 proposition nowadays.  Well,
   unless you buy one of those 21" monsters, which Homer clearly did not.  If
   you *had* to spend US$5000 for a computer system, you'd be better off
   trying to buy a multi-user server.

   As you probably guessed by watching the show, most of the processing power
   of even the $1100 machine would go to waste on the mundane chore of
   handling e-mail.  While the extra power is nice for photo editing, games,
   and heavy computational work, even a more modest processor can handle e-
   mail and text editing.  This review, for example, was produced on a three-
   year-old 133MHz Pentium laptop (for which the author paid US$3,500!).


>> It's what the internet was invented for

Ahmet Deligonul:  Dancing Jesus is a parody of that "Dancing Hampster",
   "Dancing Bricks", "Dancing Fish" and so on websites ... anyone who's ever
   signed onto the internet has unfortunately stumbled onto that crap, and
   putting a parody of that on tonight's episode really fit Homer's net
   surfing.


Benjamin Robinson adds:  The dancing baby is one of the quirkier "celebrities"
   in the short history of the mass internet.  It started off life as a
   dancing alien used to demonstrate some company's 3D animation software.
   The creators couldn't get the alien done to their satisfaction, so the demo
   idea was dropped.  As a joke, one of their employees changed it to a
   dancing baby, had a laugh, dumped it onto a CD somewhere, and then forgot
   about it.  Eventually, the users poked around the software distribution and
   found the baby dancing the night away.  Word spread among the software's
   users, and then on the internet in general. Eventually, the baby made an
   appearance on Fox's popular "Ally McBeal," and became a minor pop
   phenomenon.  Various dancing knock- offs were created to spoof the original
   baby, and it wouldn't surprise me if there was an actual Dancing Jesus out
   there, somewhere.  [And of course, several people have pointed this out:
   <http://www.jesusdance.com> -- Ed.]

   As an aside:  Before "McBeal," one of my coworkers downloaded the Dancing
   Baby to his machine.  We discovered his movements synced up nicely to a
   remix of The Cure's "Spiderman."


>> Mr. X

Hari M. Wierny:  Fox actually made Homer's website and uploaded it to
   <http://www.thesimpsons.com/mrx/> shortly before the episode first aired.
   They also did a damn good job making it resemble to the pages shown on the
   episode (even including the animated GIF of Homer's face quickly being
   covered by a question mark, and the counter going up drastically, and then
   DOWN).  The only differences I noticed were that the picture of Apu on the
   site in the episode was more distorted (to give that cartoony computer
   look) and he was holding a donut, the tumbleweed bouncing across Homer's
   site, and the counter was on a lower number.  (Note that the pages on the
   site all had the ".htm" extension instead of ".html" -- I can see Homer
   doing this.)


>> Release the lawyers!

Benjamin Robinson writes:  One of the most revolutionary things about the mass
   internet (so far) is its ability to put the power of the press into the
   hands of everyone with a basic microcomputer, an internet account, and
   something (or even nothing) to say.  Fans of TV series, movie actors, and
   musicians are no longer limited to just reading the official press releases
   from the artists' PR firms.  Now, they can tap into any number of amateur
   sites dedicated to their favorite personalities or groups, downloading
   sound bites, pictures, and even movie clips or entire TV episodes.  Not
   everyone is happy about this trend.  Major media corporations see this as a
   thieves' free-for-all, siphoning away money from their copyrighted work.

   Fox has been particularly aggressive in protecting its trademarked
   properties, demanding that sites either remove material they deem
   objectionable, or shut down altogether.  Fans of "The Simpsons" have not
   escaped Fox's wrath, and numerous popular sites have disappeared thanks to
   the efforts of Fox's legal representatives.  The network does have the
   right to protect its material, but that probably doesn't help the feelings
   of dedicated fans who watch hours of work disappear into the ether.  Fox's
   ham-fisted and arbitrary approach to the shutdowns hasn't been winning them
   friends either.  While Lisa probably *would* be sympathetic to Fox's
   intellectual property rights, it is still a little frightening to see her
   being used almost as a mouthpiece for their position.  Et tu, Lisa?


>> "The Prisoner" -- The Quick Version

Don Del Grande helps get us up to speed:  Patrick McGoohan played a secret
   agent (similar to, but not necessarily intended to be, John Drake, his
   character in "Danger Man"/"Secret Agent") who abruptly resigned, only to be
   gassed while packing for a vacation; he wakes up in what he thinks is his
   own house, only to discover he's really in a place called "The Village"
   where nobody has names, just numbers (his is 6).  Initially, the show
   concentrated on his attempts to escape, but eventually he "fought the
   system from within".


Daniel L. Dreibelbis:  Definitely one of television's most classic series --
   and one of its weirdest.  It's the story of a secret agent, known only as
   "Number 6" (played by the series' creator, Patrick McGoohan), who was
   kidnapped and taken to a remote island by his government after he abruptly
   resigned his position from its covert spy agency.  There, all attempts were
   made to break him (they want to know why he resigned) through chemicals,
   electronics and hellish hospital equipment - and all in some of the most
   surreal sets, props and supporting cast ever concocted.  It ran for
   approximately 13 episodes, and its final episode raises questions about
   whether the entire series was a dream on Number 6's part.  Elements from
   the series appeared in tonight's episode, including the anti-escape bubble
   (AKA Happy Fun Ball) and the genteel costuming worn by the other
   inhabitants on the island.


James Allen adds:  It's the ultimate in paranoid science fiction; there is
   absolutely _no one_ you can trust.

   A short time after that, 16 of the 17 episodes were first aired on US TV on
   CBS.

   Since then, it has developed a very devoted cult following, airing on
   various local stations around the country (mostly PBS stations).  Video
   release first came in 1984, and more recently it has been put out on DVD.

   It's intricate, intriguing, and downright baffling at times.  Definitely
   not everyone's cup of tea.  It doesn't have the simple good guys/bad guys
   mass market appeal of stuff like Star Trek, that's for sure.


Don Del Grande notes some specific parallels between the series and this
   episode:  "See you tomorrow" was a reference to "Be seeing you", which is
   how everybody greets everybody else in "The Village" (a thinly-veiled
   reminder that every move in The Village is watched).

   The "bubble" gag was a reference to "Rover", which looked like a giant
   white bubble, but it couldn't be popped; in fact, it could (and was its job
   to) absorb escaping "villagers".  There was also a fascination with lava
   lamps, for some unexplained reason.

   By the way, Number 6 did eventually escape (as did everybody else; The
   Village was evacuated in the last episode), and in a DC Comics book sequel
   a few years ago, returned to the ruins?


Andrew Levine disputes this final point:  That's not entirely certain.  The
   final episode, "Fall Out", ends with the same footage as the first one
   began: 6 drives his car into the distance.  So maybe it's implied that he
   ends up right where he started and didn't really go anywhere.  At least,
   that's some people's opinion.


Don Del Grande responds:  He escaped from The Village, but the ending (with
   that butler character at Number 6's front door, which opens automatically)
   was probably meant to show that he had just traded one Village for another.


On the subject of "Rover", Bill Polaski writes:  Rover was played by a big
   weather balloon, but was supposedly something a bit more durable in
   substance.  The use of a weather balloon was a last minute move by the
   producers after a complex remote-controlled mechanical device - Rover's
   original design - went renegade and plunged into the sea on its first
   testing.


>> Fun with Promotions

Mike Reed transcribes this week's trailer:

   Announcer: Homer hooks up to the internet! (Homer dragging the computer
   down the road)
   Lisa: You shouldn't drag that around, Dad!
   Homer: That's right, honey, top of the line!
   Announcer: But what will he do during long downloads?
   Homer: (singing) I'm a sittin' on the toilet, all the live long day ...
   (Note: Another trailer was seen, with only the toilet bit seen)


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Andrew Levine alterna-title for this episode is:  The Low Spark of High-
   Tech Boys


According to Fox (by way of Bill LaRue), this episode scored a Nielsen rating
   of 9.0 (13 share).  This works out to 15.6 million viewers.  Among adults
   aged 18 to 49, the rating was 7.7 (18 share).


Joe Klemm:  Homer's fake story of Spanish and Italian being the same language
   can have a little bit of credit to it, as both languages were based on the
   Latin language.


Ryan Mead:  thesimpsons.com ruins the title joke by listing it as "The
   Computer Wore Menace Sneakers."


Dwayne Conyers:  Where was Gilligan when you needed him?

Number 2:	Don't be cute.  I'm referring to the flu shot 
		expose.  You see we're the ones loading them with 
		mind-controlling additives.
Homer:		But why?  [throws another saucer]
Number 2:	To drive people into a frenzy of shopping.  That's 
		why flu shots are given just before Christmas.
Homer:		Of course.  It's so simple.  [Reconsidering] Wait, 
		no it's not.  It's needlessly complicated.
Number 2:	Yes it is.  And we can't have you out there mucking 
		it up, now, can we?
Homer:		No, sir.
Number 2:	That's a good boy.  Let's get you some ice cream.
		[a bowl of ice cream and hypodermic syringes rises 
		from within the table]
		There we are.
Homer:		Look, you can drug me all you want, but my family 
		won't rest until they find my drug-bloated corpse.
Number 2:	I wouldn't count on that Number Five.  As far as 
		your family knows, Homer Simpson is walking in the 
		front door right about now.
Homer:		[his face covered in ice cream and drugs] I'm sorry?  
		What?
-- "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes"

% Indeed, back at Springfield an imposter Homer walks through the
% front door.  He looks exactly like our Homer, but has a thick German
% accent.

Marge:		Homey!
Homer #2:	Marge honey-fräulein, I'm home.
Marge:		You're not my husband.
Homer #2:	Ja, please forgive my unexplained two-week absence.  
		To make it up to you, we will go out to dinner at a 
		sensibly  priced restaurant, then have a night of 
		efficient German sex.
Marge:		Well, I sure don't feel like cooking.

% Back on the Island, the real Homer plays croquet.  The ball gasses
% him again.
%
% In Springfield Homer #2 and Bart watch TV.  Homer #2 uses an
% electric shaver to copy Homer's unique bi-strand hairdo.  Bart
% senses that there's something different about his father.  Homer #2
% explains he's wearing a new tie, which satisfies Bart's curiosity.
%
% Meanwhile, back on the Island ...

Homer:		I'm tired of being drugged and gassed.  There's got 
		to be a way to escape.
Number 6:	Psssst.
Homer:		Huh?
Number 6:	[shows Homer a raft hidden in foliage] I worked on 
		this for 33 years.  It's made out of toilet paper 
		rolls, toothpicks, and plastic forks.  And the sail 
		is made of scabs and dynamite.  It's small and it's 
		smelly, but it should carry both of us to ...
		[Homer punches him, jumps into boat and sails off]
Number 6:	That's the third time that's happened!
-- "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes"

% As Homer sails away, a large orb rises from the ocean and gives
% chase.

Homer:		Oh no, an anti-escape orb!  [grabs one of the 
		plastic forks from the boat and pops the orb]
		Huh.  That was easy.
		[back in the kidnappers' headquarters]
Number 2:	Why did you think a big balloon would stop people?
Scientist:	Shut up!  That's why!
-- "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes"

% Homer makes it back home safely.  He logs onto the computer and
% tries to warn the world about the "crazy creeps" on the Island. 
% Suddenly the words he's typing melt away, and the mysterious Number
% 2 appears on his screen.  He informs Homer he's shutting down the
% Mr. X site.  Homer defiantly vows that only he can stop himself. 
% The impostor Homer takes this as his cue to attack.

Number 2:	Yes, Fight and Struggle!
Homer:		If I know me, he won't like being kicked in the 
		crotch!  [Homer ... disables Homer #2]
Homer #2:	Gott in himmel!
Homer:		Oh Marge, it's me, the real Homer!
Marge:		Oh Homey!
Number 2:	[claps sarcastically] Bravo, Number Five.  But you 
		know what happens to bad little fishies who wriggle 
		through the net.
Lisa:		Can I turn this off?
Homer:		Absolutely.
		[Lisa turns off the computer]
Number 2:	Hey!  [the monitor goes dark]
-- An unforeseen setback, "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes"

% The family welcomes the real Homer back, but the reunion doesn't
% last long.  The Islanders have rigged SLH with their trademark
% sleeping gas.  The next thing the Simpsons know, they are on the
% Island, wearing mod-Victorian clothes and living the genteel country
% life.

Marge:	Once you get use to the druggin's, this isn't a bad place.
Homer:	Oh, it's wonderful.  Truly God's country.
-- Even better than the Hotel California, "The Computer Wore
   Menace Shoes"

% A koala bear wearing sunglasses walks by.  He turns to the camera
% and removes the glasses, revealing a pair of gas nozzles where his
% eyes normally would be.  He "gasses" the audience, and the scene
% fades to black.

Homer:	[hypnotically] See you on the island.
Lisa:	Yes ... the island.
-- "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes"
