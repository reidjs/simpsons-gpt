> "TV Guide" Synopsis
==============================================================================
   (United States) Chastised for living so little for a man his age, Flanders
   asks for fun lessons from Homer, who obliges with a trip to Las Vegas and
   Ned's first hangover.  The Moody Blues have a cameo.  {bjr}

   (Canada) Goodie-two-shoes Ned begins to second-guess his straight and
   narrow path in life, prompting the Simpsons' neighborino to take a trip to
   Las Vegas and look to Homer for some not-so-helpful advice.  The Moody
   Blues guest-voice.  {hl}

Couch:          Live-action hand spins a picture of the Simpsons, causing the
                ink to splatter.  [Recycled from 5F06]  {ddg}

> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... Flanders' doctor is Dr. Stein, rather than Dr. Hibbert or Dr. Nick?
       [{nd} says he might have been their chiropractor -- Ed.]

Ellen Cohen:
   ... when Ned walked past the water glass in his house, his reflection
       looked like that of an old man?
   ... the way Homer's top head hairs were sticking up and curly after they
       were roasted?
   ... the Moody Blues not only knew Homer and Ned's names, but knew Ned was
       "ancient"?
   ... when the two waitresses cuddled up to Gunter and Ernst saying they knew
       how to treat women, the white tiger rolled its eyes!

Ben Collins:
   ... how Burns' attitude towards nursing homes has changed?  (he hated
       Springfield Retirement Castle; now he owns a chain of similar homes)
   ... the Simpsons sit in the front row at church, with the Flanders' behind
       them?
   ... Milhouse is sitting only with his mother at church?
   ... the ever-practical Ned Flanders still has his Geo (from 9F01)?
   ... Lisa is still as strongly against gambling as she was at the end of
       8F13? (notice her "power of attorney" protest)
   ... Lance Murdock seems to have recovered from cirrhosis of the liver,
       liver, liver?
   ... Homer puts doughnuts on his "wife's" omelet?

S. Everett Davies:
   ... Sideshow Mel goes to church without a shirt on?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Ned was 50 when Todd was born?
   ... one of the signs in Vegas says "Loosest Craps In Town"?  (Don't go to
       the buffet at that casino!  Of course, this refers to "loosest slots in
       town", which refers to the setting of slot machines so they pay back a
       larger percentage of what they take in, based on probability.)
   ... all of the slot machines are left-handed?

Yuri Dieujuste:
   ... CBG's license plates are NCC-1701?
   ... Grandpa or Jasper own a convertible?  [{ddg} suggest that someone at
       the Retirement Castle may have just loaned them one.]
   ... Homer did not take an Interstate Highway to Las Vegas?
   ... OFF's car is still in town when Ned and Homer are kicked out of town?

Jordan Eisenberg:
   ... Carl's voice sounded waaay off?
   ... when Homer yells "Don't spill my beer," Flanders does indeed spill his
       beer?
   ... Ned has a VISA card in his wallet?  (Does he consider credit cards a
       form of gambling?)

Alex Foley:
   ... This is the first episode David M. Stern has written in nearly 6 years?
   ... Lucius Sweet in the mob that throws out Homer & Ned?

Jeremy Gallen:
   ... the Holy Water burns Moe's face, so obviously he's a Satanist?
   ... Homer barbecues meat from the top of his roof?
   ... both "s's" of "Las Vegas" are spelled with dollar signs?
   ... we never get to see how Marge and the kids are doing while Ned and
       Homer are in Las Vegas?

Andrew Gill:
   ... Bart reads a misplaced Radioactive Man at the car wash?
   ... the decimals on the car wash register don't move?

Joe Green:
   ... the wall sustains more damage than Lance Murdock's head?

Tony Hill:
   ... 16 children and a dog in Cletus's truck?
   ... Homer and Ned in a heart-shaped tub?
   ... the electronic menu is headed "MENV"?
   ... the waitrons Homer and Ned "marry" are the same ones who serve them?

Darrel Jones:
   ... this is the first [non-Halloween] episode not to use Groening font
       during the closing credits?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the Kang bumper sticker on CBG's car?
   ... the slave girls' menus are push-button activated?

Haynes Lee:
   ... the vultures look similar to the one at the tribunal in "Bart The
       Mother"?
   ... Homer's "wife" was the one who smoked?

Ondre Lombard:
   ... a couch scene twice used last year is used again this season?
   ... Marge speaks of the birthday cake as if she did it?  (A surprising
       character flaw in Marge, more fitting for Homer.)
   ... this is the first time we've seen Captain Lance Murdock since "Selma's
       Choice?"
   ... Ned orders the most commonly ordered drink among women?

Nate Patrin:
   ... the "Mr. Burns' Casino" sign- or at least the Burns-as-Mermaid part-
       was still almost completely intact in the rubble as Homer and Ned drive
       through it?
   ... the "minister" at the chapel looks like (and, for all I know, might be)
       the guy that wound up marrying Homer to Marge?

Tom Rinschler:
   ... the drawstring on Homer's shorts while on the roof remain white while
       the area around it is soot covered?
   ... Homer and Ned's booth at the casino restaurant is shaped like a
       chariot?
   ... The I (heart) L V hat on the golf cart in the trashed hotel room?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Bart was sleeping in church when Homer made his announcement?
   ... the motor noises on Ned's Geo are higher-pitched (compared to previous
       shows), as you might expect from a Geo?

Matt Rose:
   ... the comic store guy drives a Gremlin?

Mike Smith:
   ... it's the first time an Elvis recording is heard on a Simpsons episode?

==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Blah blah funny second and third acts blah blah why so
   Homercentric?  blah blah yet another zany premise blah blah stupid previous
   episode references blah blah whatever happened to Bart and Lisa blah blah I
   need a drink and a shower blah blah  (C)

Rich Bunnell:  The episodes are getting wackier and wackier, but that honestly
   doesn't bother me as much as it seems to get up the butts of several a.t.s.
   denizens.  The only problem I had with this episode was the fact that Ned
   was revealed to be 60 -- what was with that?  This "destroy a character for
   the purpose of one episode" crud (you know what episode I'm referring to)
   is -really- getting annoying.  However, the jokes were pretty well done
   (the "God" speaker in the casino in particular), and the Moody Blues cameo
   at the end, while "tacked-on" (I don't really care anyway) was pretty darn
   funny.  (B)

Ben Collins:  I know this is ANOTHER episode involving a mid-life crisis
   (thank God it's not Homer's this time), but this time they do it right.
   Although I'm bothered a little by some of Homer's overboard antics and the
   serious liberties with reality and common sense, that doesn't distract from
   the righteous hilarity throughout the episode.  Many ROFL moments (the
   casino explosion, Homer's "two wives" fantasy, the numerous jabs at the
   institution of gambling), and the Moody Blues' appearance kept me
   thoroughly enjoying myself tonight.  They need to spend the rest of the
   season digs up old writers.  (B+)

Nathan DeHoff:  This one contained a lot of laughs.  True, many of them were
   closer to typical cartoon goofiness than brilliant social satire, but they
   were still amusing. Homer and Ned were both in good form.  Some of the best
   bits were Ned's conversation with "God," Homer revealing that the waffle
   bar was closed, and the excuse fabricated by Homer at the end of the
   episode.  The previous episode references sometimes seemed gratuitous, but
   it was nice to see Lance Murdock again, and to discover the fate of Mr.
   Burns' Casino.  The plot probably could have used a stronger resolution,
   though.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty good episode.  (B)

Jeff Dean:  Did I say I liked it when the Simpsons did outrageous stories?  I
   take it back.  While "Viva Ned Flanders" was occasionally funny, it was
   also mindblowingly stupid, particularly in the entire third act.  The first
   scene, with some nice self-refs, really stood out, but the rest of the
   episode just didn't do much for me at all.  I remember when episodes had a
   certain something that made worth watching again and again... it was called
   a plot.  (C)

Don Del Grande:  The episode had a few surprises (I thought for sure that the
   weddings would turn out to be fake), but it didn't really go anywhere,
   especially at the end  (B)

Yuri Dieujuste:  This episode was pretty decent.  I expected the episode to
   the toward the mediocre range.  Good writing, good jokes made this episode
   good.  I also like the fact that they remembered Burns' casino and the fact
   that the town had moved.  But this episode has made think about the
   animation.  The character's faces have moved from a glossy yellow (in
   Season 6 - 7) to a dark yellow.  But then I felt that the casino was well
   drawn.  (A)

Jordan Eisenberg:  What is it about the even-numbered episodes this season?
   First off, Homer was the only Simpson to be shown throughout the second and
   third acts (barring a quick dream sequence).  Second, I only laughed out
   loud twice: at the conversation about Burns' casino, then when Homer and
   Ned failed to injure the utility workers.  Third, IMO, the animation looked
   like a slightly more polished and complex version of South Park.  It really
   seems like Film Roman is animating in its sleep.  OTOH, I thought the chase
   scene at the end was entertaining.  Hopefully, next week we'll get the
   first episode that DOESN'T involve Homer in some way.  As for Matt
   Groening, I don't know how to explain his pride in this one.  It just
   wasn't very good.  (D+)

Alex Fandonwittsy:  If any of you have common wit, you'd know how terrible
   this was.  Homer was as obnoxious and cruel as ever.  Another lame ending
   to a very lame ep.  And, guess what?  Those who doubted that they couldn't
   ruin Ned's character anymore more were VERY wrong.  I am stunned that some
   people are actually giving this an A+ !!!  I give it the complete opposite,
   and here it is, a failing grade [almost -- Ed.] to the worst episode of the
   season:  (D-)

Alex Foley:  Funniest episode of the year (Okay, the year's only 11 days
   old...)! Homer and Ned were in rare form, lending itself to many great
   moments (Ned's talk to "God", Homer's fantasy about having 2 wives, Homer &
   Ned Vs. the Janitors...).  My only complaint would be the lack of the rest
   of OFF, who each only had a few token lines.  Oh yes, welcome back David M.
   Stern.  (A)

Jeremy Gallen:  This was an excellent episode.  Ned trying to act like Homer
   had me ROTFLMAO.  It was also funny when Homer and Ned wound up married to
   the cocktail waitresses.  IMHO, this episode deserves my highest rating, an
   (A+)

Andrew Gill:  OK.  I'll let the cat out of the bag.  I was hoping that it
   would be a scam.  But although it wasn't, I still thought that Matt
   Groening was right when he said, "It'll rock your world."  (Oh, wait...)
   Aside from the half-decent last act, I felt that this was a very good
   episode.  Homer's a loveable idiot, and Ned's a goody-man who has genuine
   emotions.  It still had a few problems with plot (or rather, ending) and
   zaniness (like the slot-machine race), but it was a good enough episode to
   make me say:  (A-)

Joe Green:  The revelation about Ned's age was a bit farfetched, but this was
   still one of the better Season 10 efforts.  Highlights included Ned
   freaking out at being "overstimulated" and Homer and Ned being hunted down
   for ditching their "wives".  (B+)

Tony Hill:  This was a simply outrageous episode!  It was reminiscent of the
   fabulously hilarious episodes of classic Simpsons.  Some of the best
   material came from the signs and ancillary gags.  I know I haven't given
   OFF extremely good grades this season, but this one is totally deserving of
   a an A+!  (A)

Darrel Jones:  Another great Season Ten ep!  I especially loved Act Three's
   wackiness (the utility closet fight, Homer's determination to stay married
   to his cocktail waitress wife, many Vegas spoofs).  The only problem was a
   slapdash ending that didn't make much sense.  Still, great episode.  (A)

Joe Klemm:  To start off the New Year, the show kicks off with another one of
   Homer's silly adventures.  The writers did a clever job with the jokes.
   However, I don't think Ned is even a senior citizen.  (B+)

Haynes Lee:  At least this episode didn't ruin Flanders. The old age
   discontinuity did not help thing very much. The Moody Blues guest
   appearance was even more tacked on then U2's.  (B)

Tom Rinschler:  After an outrageously funny and self-referencing first act,
   the story slowed somewhat when Homer and Ned left for Las Vegas.  I was
   ROFL several times during the first act, and loved how they wrapped up the
   old storyline of Burns' casino (and how many among you said that the moving
   of the town would never be referred to again?).  The parts in Las Vegas,
   however, while often humorous, did not keep up the same pace as the earlier
   section.  It was good to see some non-hostile interaction between Homer and
   Ned too.  (B+)

Jason Rosenbaum:  After some of the most forgettable crap in the history of
   the Simpsons, Viva Ned Flanders comes along.  Lots of great gags (Nero's
   Palace, The Fear And Loathing gag, Flanders being 60) and lots of great
   earlier episode references.  The ending was pretty damn weird, it could
   have been better.  This is what Season 10 will be remembered for.  (A)

Yours Truly:  Another in a series of episodes that take age-old sitcom plots,
   and put a uniquely "Simpsons" spin on them.  This episode does a good job
   of it, too, despite hewing closely to the traditional "bad trip to Vegas"
   plot.  Ned makes an interesting run at breaking out of a rut, and Homer
   gets to expand on his life philosophy.  Some of the supporting
   characterization is a little flat, and the family by necessity gets the
   short shrift.  I can overlook that, though, and pronounce that 1999 is off
   to a good start in the "Simpsons" universe.  (B+)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B (3.10)   Std Dev.: 0.9659   (34 reviews computed)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Writer Watch

Dale Ab, er, I mean Jordan Eisenberg writes:  David M. Stern is one of the
   veteran writers for the series, having written such classics as "Bart Gets
   an "F" (7F03)," "Principal Charming (7F15)," "Homer Alone (8F14)," "Kamp
   Krusty (8F24)," "Selma's Choice (9F11)" and "Duffless (9F14)."  If you're
   one of those who notices the differences between these episodes and last
   night's, your guess is as good as mine.


>> It's the affair about nothing

Benjamin Robinson:  Jerry Seinfeld, as if I needed to point it out to you, is
   a noted comedian with a checkered dating history.  His first paramour (that
   the press cared about) was Soshona Kohler, who was in high school when they
   first met.  Seinfeld and Kohler eventually drifted apart, and then he was
   romantically linked to -- what was her name?  Ah, who cares?  It definitely
   wasn't Bart's mom, though.  What I can say is that she is a married society
   woman, which has set tongues a-wagging.


>> Meta-Reference corner

Benjamin Robinson:  Lisa notes that Burns' casino caught the town's fancy for
   a week, and then "everyone just forgot about it."  This is funny when you
   remember that most sitcoms only remember back for about a week.


>> It's a boom town -- literally!

Tourism in Vegas has been growing by leaps and bounds recently, thanks to
   marketing efforts to position the city as a destination for families,
   instead of just adults looking to try their gambling luck.  To accommodate
   all the new businesses, many old hotels have been demolished to make room
   for -- new, bigger hotels.  (At least one of the new super-hotels is seen:
   The Luxor, which is the pyramid-shaped building with the powerful
   searchlight at the top.)  In the quest for space, developers have even
   dynamited casinos on the Strip, like the Dunes, which have "defined" the
   city for years.


>> Not dealing with a full deck

Tony Hill explains some of the finer points of Vegas gambling:  A device known
   as the shoe was introduced in blackjack in the middle of this century to
   prevent bottom-dealing, which Burns alleged was happening at his casino, as
   well as second-card dealing, which was much more common.  (But perhaps such
   regulations were never implemented in the state that Springfield is in.)

   The scatological joke "loosest craps in town" is a play on the phrase
   "loosest slots," which means the machines are set to pay a high percentage.
   It wouldn't really apply to Craps since the rules are much the same all
   over and don't make much difference in the payout anyway.


>> That'll teach 'em to turn us down

Benjamin Robinson relates:  Don Rickles is an insult comic who regularly
   travels the casino circuit.  More interestingly, he is one of the few
   people to turn the producers of "The Simpsons" down when they approached
   him about a guest role.  Perhaps the producers were finally getting revenge
   when they had Rickles blown up and run over in tonight's show.


>> Ancient Ned

The big issue in the discussions for this episode was Ned's claim that he was
   60 years old.  The church had a hard time believing this, and so did the
   audience.


Matt Rose sums up the problem:  I have a *big* problem with Ned's age being
   60.  It's just not possible....if his parents are beatniks, that would
   pretty much make Ned a pre-adolescent in the late 50's.  If he was 60 now,
   it would have made him 18 in 1957. I assume Ned to be about 11 or 12 in
   that scene from another episode when he spills ink all over his Dad's
   poems.  (Oh man!  You're sending us back to squaresville, man!  A real flat
   tire!  A cube man!)  [Ondre Lombard pegs his age as between 6 and 8 in the
   flashbacks -- Ed.]


Okay, now that we have a figure for Ned's age, is there any way to explain it?
   (Other than, "Someone goofed," which isn't any fun.)  Several theories were
   proposed, starting with Tom Rinschler)


Tom Rinschler:  If Ned is now 60, he was born in 1938 or 1939.  We see a you
   (around 10 years old) Ned in "Hurricane Neddy".  There his parents were
   portrayed as beatniks.  As this group is identified with the 1950s, Ned's
   parents were probably ahead of the curve, becoming beatniks at the start of
   the trend, around 1949-50 or so.


Todd Emerson:  The flashbacks in "Hurricane Neddy" were supposed to have
   happened only 30 years (or so) previously, which would in fact make his
   parent's far BEHIND the times.  Which would explain how they would
   eventually end up raising such a square as Ned.


Andrew Gill:  He provided no proof [of his age].  I'll just assume that he was
   younger, and lying to cover.


Ellen Cohen embellishes Mr. Gill's theory:  maybe Ned lied about his age to
   the community to get out of trouble for stealing Grandma Flanders' senior
   discount card!  Where IS Grandma Flanders anyway?  Don't you wonder about
   that?  Maybe Ned figured the only way to protect his saintly reputation was
   to tell a little white lie.  It doesn't hurt anyone to know his real
   age...at least not in Springfield.  No one seemed to be adversely affected
   by it, except the people of a.t.s.  And considering he's exactly the same
   person...why not let it drop like the Armin Tamzarian business?


Someone known only as "Ghoull":  Ned's parents may not have told him his real
   age.  They were, after all, clove-smoking, freaky beatniks, who, in their
   mad opposition to civilization and decency, may not have believed in the
   numerical system that we know and love.  Ned, as a kid, asks his parents
   how old he is, and they, in a fit of hemp-induced madness reply, "Uh, 15?
   16?  Mona, help me out here."   "Groovy, hep cat."


Lee Johnson:  I felt as though they were deliberately tweaking the noses of us
   "magic xylophone" fans on the internet in advance as they knew the upcoming
   revelation about Ned would disturb those who care about character
   continuity.


Harry Markins:  Ned, whose memory appears to be screwed up, was mis-
   remembering his childhood.  That's as good as anything else; in fiction
   (which this is), you can make up anything to explain "continuity gaps."
   But, as I say, this is purely, totally, utterly trivial.


Ted J. Mill:  Flanders is such a straight-arrow that he skipped being a
   teenager and early-20's, all that puberty and rebellion and uncertainty and
   so on.  Being born in 1950, but jumping directly from 13 to 25, makes him
   60 today (and he has a senior citizen ID from Harvard Medical School,
   explaining all this in really tiny print).


Andrew Chang:  Perhaps Homer isn't the only non-Brazilian to use a time
   machine?


Jordan Eisenberg reprinted this article which ran in the January 12 "Star-
   Ledger":  A Jan. 12 All TV item about last week's "The Simpsons" asked how
   Ned Flanders could be 60 years old when a previous episode established that
   he was raised by beatniks, presumably in the late '50s or early '60s.
   Continuity error, right?

   Maybe not, writes Steve Hirsch of Basking Ridge.  "Of course Ned is 60 and
   he was born in the '50s.  You see, the Simpsons have eight fingers, so they
   use base 8, instead of base 10.  Sixty in base eight is equal to 48 base
   10.  So much for continuity problems!"


Mr. Eisenberg adds:  Good thinking, but if their universe really was rooted in
   base 8, there would only be 8 years in a decade, and 48 years before 1999
   would be 1939 (never mind the fact that neither year would actually
   exist!).  It's still the most creative solution I've heard.


And finally, Jeff Dean leaves us with this thought:  But look at it this way:
   he's still younger than any of the Rolling Stones by far!  ;-)


>> The truth about beatniks and hippies

While debating Ned's age, people at times called his parents beatniks and
   hippies.  This in turn led to another debate over the differences between
   the two groups.  John Daniel wrote this detailed field guide to spotting
   Beats.

   Beatniks in a way laid the groundwork for the hippies.  The beatniks were a
   subculture that grew out of the societal strictures of the Eisenhower era.

   This subculture manifested itself first in literature, with a group of
   writers known as the Beat Generation.  Key figures of the Beat Generation,
   or "Beats", were novelist Jack Kerouac, poet Allen Ginsburg, writer/junkie
   William S. Burroughs, poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, [and] poet Gary Snyder.
   Works by any of these writers during the period 1950-60 should give you a
   good impression of what that era was about.  I particularly recommend
   Kerouac's "The Subterraneans" and Ferlinghetti's "A Coney Island of the
   Mind."

   Of course, like many artistic/creative movements, innovation eventually
   turns to imitation as the movement becomes mainstream, eventually turning
   into self-parody.  This is where the stereotypical beatnik, with his bongos
   and beret and black clothes, comes in.  See Maynard G. Krebs from the old
   TV show "Dobie Gillis".

   Lisa Simpson's poem (the one she writes after Bart tosses her "Women in
   American History" table centerpiece into the fireplace) is a direct parody
   of Ginsberg's "Howl", which became the centerpiece of an obscenity trial
   and landmark First-Amendment case, and perhaps the single most recognizable
   work of the Beats

   "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness; starving,
   hysterical, naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn,
   looking for an angry fix" (That's from memory, no flames please)

   A few differences between hippies and beatniks: Where the hippies made mind
   expansion through drug use a centerpiece of their mantra (tune in, turn on,
   drop out), the beatniks were more about dropping out than turning on
   (though they were no strangers to drug use).  Themes of constant travel,
   freedom, wandering are important in the beatnik ideology: see John Clellan
   Holmes' "Go", Kerouac's "On the Road", and Ginsberg's "The Blue
   Automobile".

   Both hippies and beatniks were very into music; for the hippies it was
   psychedelic rock, for the beatniks it was jazz (Charlie Parker, early Miles
   Davis) and spoken-word poetry.

   Where the hippies' principal enemy was the war (as well as The Man), the
   beatniks were in rebellion against "square" society and the homogenization
   of American culture.  This is where Ned Flanders comes in.

   This is not to say that there were not many strong links between the two
   subcultures, and that one developed from the other.  For example, Neal
   Cassady (a.k.a. Dean Moriarty), the hero of On The Road, cropped up in the
   late '60's as one of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, and driver of the
   Further bus. Allen Ginsberg got spiritual, and got naked at numerous be-
   in's.  A large number of the later beats simply traded their black
   turtlenecks for tie-dyes and kept on truckin'.

   Jack Kerouac, unable to cope with his sudden leader-of-a-movement demigod
   status (Kurt Cobain is an imprecise but still useful analogue) drank
   himself to death in the late 60's.

   I'm sure this is much more information than you wanted.  Sorry for
   rambling.  But at least now you can sleep through the first 3 weeks of
   Postwar American Literature.  [Disclaimer:  The Simpsons Archive does not
   recommend that you sleep through the first 3 weeks of Postwar American
   Literature -- Ed.]


Mylene Smith provides a quick-reference chart to keep you from confusing the
   two cultures:

   Beatniks

   Clothing -- Black, turtlenecks, jackets, berets, sunglasses (indoors or
   outdoors).
   Approval -- snapped their fingers instead of clapping.
   Speech -- Cool Daddy-Oh
   Hair -- Short and neat for men and maybe a goatee.  Long and straight for
   women, maybe with it combed in front of their face.
   Music -- Jazz

   Hippies

   Clothes -- Colorful, bell bottoms, granny skirts, peasant blouses, tube
   tops, T-shirts.
   Approval -- clapped if they weren't passed out or so stoned out of their
   gourd they had no idea what was going on.
   Speech -- Groovy man.  Far out.
   Hair -- Long for both sexes.
   Music -- Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep, Cream, etc.


>> We have met the enemy, and he is Ned

Joe Slater:  I thought it was a great reference in "Viva Ned Flanders" when
   Homer called Ned "Churchy LaFemme."  Not to date myself or sound too much
   like the Comic Store Guy, but Churchy LaFemme was the name of a turtle
   character who was a mainstay in the old "Pogo" comic strip by Walt Kelly.
   [The strip was resurrected during the Nineties, but was retired again --
   Ed.]  The character was neither religious nor particularly effeminate (as
   cartoon turtles go).  But these connotations work perfectly for Flanders.
   A very cool little bit in an OK episode, showing what the "Simpsons" can
   still do that no other show does.


Tony Hill explores the origin of the name:  "Cherchez la femme," which
   literally means "where is the woman," is a polite euphemism for a skirt-
   chaser.  Homer's pun of Ned is several levels above Homer's usual
   mentality.


Lee Johnson adds:  Ironically, something Ned is about to become in this
   episode [is a skirt-chaser or womanizer].


>> Ned Frivolous

Todd Emerson:  Ned claims to have never partook of anything frivolous?  Then
   what was up with that rec room in his basement, with the fully loaded bar?
   And the time he wanted to bartend at one of Marge & Homer's parties?  And
   let's not forget his quitting the pharmaceutical biz to open his own store.
   Sounds like ol' Neddie can get pretty frivolous to me!  Bad writers!  No
   soup for you!


>> The bland gourmet

Dale G. Abersold:  When I heard Ned mention that he likes plain white bread
   "with a glass of water on the side for dippin'," I was struck with the
   thought I had heard something like that before...but where?  Not until
   today at work did it strike me.  Ezra Taft Benson!

   Who is Ezra Taft Benson, you ask?  Well, he was Secretary of Agriculture
   during all eight years of the Eisenhower presidency, but he is probably
   better known as the leader of the Mormon Church from 1985 to 1994 (when he
   died).  [Coincidentally, he was a second cousin of mine.  Also, he attended
   Utah State University, which is mine and [fellow a.t.s.'er] Solon Boomer-
   Jenks' alma mater.] Anyway, the reason I bring him up is, whenever he was
   asked what his favorite food or indulgence was, he responded "a bowl of
   bread and milk."  What most of us would dismiss as the blandest of meals,
   he regarded as ambrosia. Weird.

   Like Ned Flanders, Ezra's resisting of all the major urges didn't hurt him
   in the aging department: he lived 95 years.

   Yes, I know this post was pointless.  Mea culpa.  [Oh, I don't know.  It
   did get you in the episode capsule -- Ed.]


>> Open the Bubble doors, HAL...

Andrew Gill:  Bubble children, as they are (euphemistically/discriminatingly)
   called, are children who have various immune deficiencies, which prohibit
   them from coming in contact with any pathogens.  The most famous bubble boy
   way David (I think that was his name), who also had a little excursion
   suit.


>> Night of a quarter-dozen stars

Benjamin Robinson:  In addition to [Don Rickles], we saw references to

   Joan Rivers:  Former stand-up comic and talk show host who approaches Ned
   and Homer in the car.  Her allegedly untalented daughter is Melissa Rivers.
   [See next item for more -- Ed.]

   Rip Taylor:  Actor, I think, who has a long-running act on the Vegas scene.

   Taylor Negron:  Actor and stand-up comic, although I saw his act on TV and
   can't imagine why.


>> The Talentless Miss Rivers

Jeff Cross:  Joan Rivers' daughter Melissa is basically little more than a
   Hollywood poseur leeching off the fame of her mother; Joan herself hasn't
   had any real work since her talk show was canned.  Both women have found
   work, however, on the cable channel E! doing "fashion review shows": this
   is where they sit around for an hour with assorted "fashion experts" like
   Leon Hall and comment on which celebrities they felt dressed well or badly,
   all the while making it sound like a person's self-worth is in the size of
   their personal wardrobe budget.


>> Well, he was _A_ Caesar...

Tom Rinschler gives us the life and times of Rome's very own Nero:  Nero's
   Palace is of course modeled after the famous Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.
   Instead of bearing the name of the Julius Caesar, the famous Roman general
   and dictator (NOT emperor), it instead is named after his great-great-
   great-great grandnephew and distant successor Nero, the fifth Emperor of
   Rome.  Unlike his illustrious predecessor, Nero was much less admirable
   (hence the humor in the switching of names).  Due to the scheming of his
   mother, he came to the throne as a teenager, unlearned in statecraft,
   although he considered himself quite the artist.  As a result, he grew into
   a tyrannical and debauched ruler, although the empire did well when he
   still listened to his advisors (such as the philosopher Seneca).
   Unfortunately, his paranoia led him to execute anyone who gained any
   influence over him, including his mother and Seneca.  One of his few
   shining moments was after the great fire of Rome in AD 64, when he
   coordinated the relief efforts for the thousands of refugees; but then he
   soiled his reputation again by dispelling rumors that he had started it (a
   rumor which is easily proved false, as he was miles away at the time) by
   blaming it on the nascent Christians and other groups and having them
   brutally executed.  Finally, in the end, in AD 69, the people of the Empire
   had enough and rose up in rebellion against their Emperor.  Several armies
   marched on Rome and Nero committed suicide (botching it badly, BTW).


Not enough?  Andrew Gill has more:  Nero was an interesting kid.  He became
   emperor at an extremely young age and his mother, who wanted to rule all of
   Rome herself, used the opportunity to rule vicariously through him. She
   repressed his son, and refused him to practice the arts and theatre (his
   true love). So, Nero began to find other outlets for his energy (like wild,
   crapulent parties).  It has been said that he lusted for his mother, but he
   also tried to kill her (multiple times, but she would somehow survive in a
   very Clouseau-esque manner).  Nero was in constant fear of death (and for
   good reason: everyone close to him was trying to kill him).

   Nero's palace was unfinished by the time of his death, but it would have
   been the most extravagant palace in human history.  The parties there were
   (as I said) very crapulent.  Expensive wine was served, even though it had
   gone vinegary, elegant puddings, silver toothpicks, the whole nine yards.
   There's a line in the Satyricon about a boar being cut open, and live birds
   flying out.  That's the sort of stuff that was going on.  Not to mention
   the debauchery.  No, Nero wasn't gay.  He just made love with men when no
   women were available.  (I'm serious. Nero was hereosexual.)

   For more info, consult your local library, or try Trimalchio's Dinner
   Party.  It's the only part of the Satyricon that has been translated
   (IIRC).  The rest is too sick.


>> The Satin Knights, er, I mean, The Moody Blues

The Moody Blues as an opening act?  "Hardly," says Mike Smith:  The Moody
   Blues are currently comprised of Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Ray Thomas &
   Graeme Edge.  The group was formed in May, 1964, with Edge, Thomas, Michael
   Pinder (Who stayed with the group until 1978, after their first string of
   hits [Which flourished from 1968 through the Mid-1970's] have ended), Denny
   Laine (Who later join Paul McCartney's group, Wings) and Clint Warwick,
   which was the lineup that recorded their first American hit, the modestly
   successful "Go Now", in 1965.  Laine & Warwick left the group the following
   year, replaced by Hayward & Lodge.  It was the lineup that earned them as
   one of the most successful groups of the late 1960's and 1970's, starting
   with the album, "Days Of Future Passed", and the single from it, "Nights In
   White Satin", in early 1968.  After Pinder left in 1978, Patrick Moraz (Who
   was the original keyboardist for the early 1970's-early 1980's group, Yes,
   before they became popular) replaced him, and stayed until 1989, where the
   current lineup have stayed ever since.  Their most recent best seller is
   their 1992 "Live At  Red Rock" album.  Their popularity have not been faded
   in recent years, thanks to AOR and Classic Rock stations.


Benjamin Robinson adds:  Another Moody Blues trademark is the lush orchestral
   backgrounds many of their songs have.  During their reunion tour, they even
   managed to recruit a symphony orchestra to go on tour with them.


Jeremy Reaban adds:  [The Moody Blues'] lines parody of the last two lines of
   the ending poem of Nights in White Satin.  "Cold Hearted orb that rules the
   night, removes the colors from our sight, red is grey, and yellow white,
   but we decide which is right, and which is an illusion???"

   [Mr. Reaban also identifies Edge as the group's drummer, Hayward as the
   singer/guitarist, Lodge as the bassist, and Thomas as the flutist.  Lodge
   and Thomas also do some of the singing -- Ed.]


>> Full Faith and Flanders

Andrew Gill explains why Homer and Ned aren't bigamists:  At least in the real
   world, Ned and Homer shouldn't be married to anyone else but Maude and
   Marge, respectively.  This is due to a little clause in the Constitution
   called "Full Faith and Credit."  It states that any contract made in any
   state is valid in all 50 states (I'm not sure about places like Midway or
   Puerto Rico).  This clause was created for cases like moving your wagon
   across state lines, or keeping your wife while you go to purchase
   fireworks.  It recently received a lot of attention, due to Hawaii (I
   think) allowing same-sex marriages.  If this were allowed in Hawaii,
   nothing short of a constitutional amendment could allow other states to
   refuse to recognize the unions. (I, on the other hand, believe that
   marriage should simply be a conferring of rights that anyone could receive,
   and that the whole concept of marriage should be eliminated from the public
   scene.)


>> How to tell those waitresses apart

For anyone who has trouble confusing the two waitresses, Jordan Eisenberg
   provides a handy field guide to discerning them from one another:

   Homer's wife             Ned's wife

   ===                    ===

   Name:  Amber             Name:  Ginger
   Maggie Roswell's voice   Tress MacNeille's voice [*]
   Thinner
   Lighter, longer hair     Darker, shorter hair
   Purple dress             Red dress
   Gold, ring-shaped        Red, triangle-shaped
     earrings                 earrings
   Thin necklace with       Thick necklace with a
   a heart-shaped stone     triangle-shaped stone
   Bracelet on her left     Ankle bracelets
     arm
   White shoes              Red shoes
   Red eyeshadow            Blue eyeshadow
   Smokes                   Files her nails

   [* But see Cast section for a different take on this -- Ed.]


>> Car Watch Jackpot

Benjamin Robinson observes:  This episode either holds the title for most Real
   Cars in one show, or is a strong contender for it.  Here's what I saw.

   Comic Book Guy drives an AMC Gremlin.  [Credit goes to Matt Rose for
   noticing this first -- Ed.]  This one has the large taillights, so I
   suspect it's one of the later models.

   The posters at the car wash waiting area showed Porsche 911s, which I think
   is required by law in North America.

   Ned, of course, still has his Geo (now Chevy) Metro.  Note that the motor
   sounds more like an authentic Geo motor than it did previously.

   Grampa is carjacked while driving an early-Nineties Ford Mustang GT
   convertible.

   While Homer and Ned drive to Las Vegas, they pass a 1969 Cadillac
   convertible going the other way.

   The guys try to make their escape in a 1956 (or maybe '57) Chevrolet
   Corvette.


>> Where is Springfield

Gary Wilson:  It seems Springfield is *very* near Las Vegas.  Granted, it's
   near everything, but it seems a bit of a clue...I  mean, at the end, it
   seems as though they are going to walk home, and they did drive in one day.
   But, I realize it means nothing.


Tony Hill elaborates:  It appeared that Homer and Ned approached Vegas from
   the Southeast, perhaps after driving across Hoover Dam, which would suggest
   that Springfield is in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, or one of the states of
   the Deep South.  It appears, however, that the mob ditched them at the
   California state line (there was no water) and the two kept walking farther
   into California.


Nathan DeHoff has an interesting observation:  Isn't it odd how, no matter how
   far from Springfield the Simpsons travel, they almost always run into
   someone else from the town?  Okay, so there were no other
   Springfieldianites in Australia or outer space, but there were some at
   Itchy and Scratchy Land (Cletus, Frink, and Roger Meyers), the Mt.
   Swartzwelder Historic Cider Mill (the Flanders family), and the Ogdenville
   Outlet Mall (Cletus and Brandine).


>> Viva Elvis!

Mike Smith:  "Viva Las Vegas" (Made in 1964) is, in fact, what critics is
   calling the best of the Formula Elvis movies that rotted between 1960
   (After he discharged from the Army) and 1968 (When he made his Comeback
   Special).  The plot is pure crap for an Elvis movie, but, when Ann-Margaret
   is the co-star and performed together, it's GREAT!!!  it's better shown in
   it's widescreen format!

   Although not credited in the movie (as does most of his movies), the title
   song is written by Mort Shulin & the late Doc Pomus, who wrote many of
   Elvis' classic songs.  Although it's now called one of Elvis' greatest
   recordings ever, it was not a major hit when it was first released as a
   single (Since that song is ended up as a B-Side).


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Flanders Does Vegas


Dale G. Abersold:  I thought I'd make like Haynes Lee and come up with my own
   alterna-title: "Fear and Loathing of Ned Flanders"


Jeremy Gallen:  By the way, did anybody know that "Viva Las Vegas" is Spanish
   for "Live the Fertile Valleys?"


Tony Hill:  Since Homer frequently forgets the name (and existence) of his
   youngest child, how does he remember (correctly) that Hitler's birthday is
   April 20?


Joe Klemm:  If a person has a bad immunity system, then they usually end up
   living in plastic bubbles that protect them from germs.  A good example of
   this is John Travolta in the 1970's made-for-TV movie.


Tom Rinschler:  "Any Way You Want It" is heard when Grandpa and Jasper are
   carjacked

Bart:     Throw hot wax on him, Dad.
Ned:      [walks up] Howdy, Homer.  [shows the teenager an ID card]
Clerk:    Five dollars, please.
Homer:    Hey!  How did Churchy La Femme get half price?

% At church the next Sunday, Reverend Lovejoy preaches what he knows

          around a second time.  Brother Ned, you'll do the honors.

          as crooked as you or me!
          [the church-goers murmur to each other]
          That's right.  It's my sad duty to rat out this man for

Ned:      That's not quite true.
Homer:    Did you, or did you not use a senior citizens' discount card

Ned:      Well, I did, but ...
Homer:    Now I'm not a fancy big city lawyer, [congregation gasps] but

          [jumping out of the car, he runs into Joan Rivers]
Rivers:   Oh, oh!  Would you like to be in the audience for my
          infomercial?
Ned:      Aaahh!  [jumps back into the car]
Rivers:   [running alongside car] Help me!  My daughter's not talented!
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Pulling into "Nero's Palace", Homer and Ned notice a man on a
% motorcycle high above them.

Homer:    Hey!  Lance Murdock!
Ned:      If he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that
          ramp.
Homer:    He's a daredevil, Ned!  He laughs at death.
Ned:      Huh, when I wanna laugh, I'll take Bob Saget, thank you very
          much!
-- He hasn't seen "Half Baked" I'll bet, "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Lance gets ready to defy death.

Announcer:  And now, the indestructible Lance Murdock will jump his
            "suicycle" over an audience member.  And he'll do it while
            attempting to open a locked safe on his head!  Any
            volunteers?
Homer:      [pointing out Flanders] Pick him!  Pick him!
Ned:        No, Homer, no!  I want do something exciting, but I can't
            just go from zero to thirty like that!  I could be killed!
Homer:      Fine, I'll do it.  [to Murdock]  Where do you want me?
Murdock:    On the 'X'!
            [Homer looks to a nearby ramp with a skull and crossbones
            'X' on it.  Red colored splatters decorate the incline]
Homer:      You mean the one with the red paint?
Murdock:    Uh, yeah, paint.  Now, it's of critical importance that you
            don't ...
Homer:      Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure it out.  This isn't rocket
            science.
Murdock:    Well actually, there are several rockets mounted to the ...
Homer:      Boring!
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Homer lies down and the drumroll begins.  With a safe on his head,
% Lance takes off down the ramp and into the air.

Announcer:  He's cleared the ring of fire ... and the ring of ice ...
            over the dog doo stick ... he's cracked the safe ...
Homer:      [sitting up] Hey, Flanders, don't spill my beer!
Murdock:    Oh, God, lay down!  Lay down!
            [attempting to miss Homer, crashes and rolls into a nearby
            concrete wall.  Medics pounce on him with an electric heart-
            starter]
Announcer:  He's all right, folks!
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% The crowd cheers while Homer walks away with Ned.

Homer:    Okey-dokey.  Let's hit the tables.
Ned:      Huh!  My God, Homer, watching you risk your life turned my
          beat box all the way up to ... rumba!  Well yeah, I was
          praying you'd be safe, but to, to, to be honest part of me
          wanted to see you get splattered!
Homer:    Ooh, I think someone just had his first taste of bloodlust!
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% At the roulette wheel, Homer tries to figure out on which number to
% bet.

Homer:         Let's see, what's Marge's birthday?  Barney is April
               twentieth, same as Hitler's, so Marge must be fifty ...
               oh, forget it.  Flanders, what's your birthday?
Ned:           Aw, leave me out of this, Homer.  Games of chance are
               strictly forbidden by Deuteronomy 7.
Homer:         Seven, eh?
               [Homer places his chips on seven; the ball lands in the
               seven slot]
Homer:         Way to go, Flanders!  The Bible's finally pulling its
               weight.  Got any more holy numbers?
Ned:           Oh, I got a bunch, Homer, but I just don't feel right.
               Oh, Lord, what should I do?
               [Ned looks up at the ceiling, staring at a black bubble
               camera which quietly says "Keep gaming"]
Ned:           What?
Security Man:  [speaking through bubble] It means gambling.  Keep
               gambling.
Ned:           Oh!  Righty-O!
-- A sign from above, "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Flanders consents, asking for "one betting disk."  This is far too
% timid for Homer, and he empties the contents of Ned's wallet onto the
% table.  The number loses, and the dealer pulls the stack away.  Homer
% nonchalantly accepts the loss and goes for a drink.
%
% At a table, Homer sits drinking, next to Ned.

Ned:      How do you do it, Homer?  How do you silence that little
          voice that says, 'think'?
Homer:    You mean Lisa?
Ned:      Oh, no, I mean common sense.
Homer:    Oh, that.  That can be treated with our good friend alcohol!
          You might want to write that down.  Where the hell's your
          notebook?
Ned:      You threw it out the ...
Homer:    Never mind, just pay attention.  Slave girl!  Oh, slave girl!
Amber:    More libations, my imperial conqueror?
Homer:    Huh?
Ginger:   [annoyed] More booze!
Homer:    Oh, yeah.  Two more of these, please.  And for you, Ned?
Ned:      I'll have a Shirley ... no, a Virgin ... no!  Make it a
          children's ... Oh, what the heck, you only live once.  Give
          me a white wine spritzer!
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% The word "spritzer" echoes in Ned's brain; moments later, in our time
% at least, the two sit in a hot tub in the middle of a completely
% trashed hotel room.  Ned wakes up.

Ned:      Oh my goodness, Homer, wake up!  [shakes Homer]
Homer:    Meh ... up?
Ned:      Look at this place.  We must have really painted the town
          last night.  I have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like
          vomit, and I don't remember a thing!
Homer:    Welcome to my world.
Ned:      Oh, I did it!  I conquered my fears, and I made up for a lot
          of lost living!  And I owe it all to the Homer Simpson
          program!
Ginger:   Well, it's about time you two woke up.
Homer:    Well of course it ... aah!  Who are you?
Ginger:   Who am I?  I'm Mrs. Ned Flanders!
Ned:      Gaahh!
Homer:    [laughing] Hey, smooth move, Flanders!
Amber:    And I'm Mrs. Homer Simpson.
Homer:    Aaah!
Ned:      Here comes that vomit again.
Homer:    Bleeah!
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% [End of Act Two.  Time:  14:30]
%
% Homer and Ned are still a bit shaken up by the news; Homer tries to
% determine the situation for himself.

Homer:    Okay.  Okay, okay, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, you're saying
          that Ned and me married you two.
Amber:    Oh yeah, we're hitched all right.  "'Til death do us part."
Ned:      [trying to hang himself with a belt] I'm working on that.
Homer:    Ned, no!  Think of your wives!
-- Won't somebody =please= think of the wives?  "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Homer is suspicious of this new situation.

Homer:    Wait a minute.  This could be some kind of scam.  Or possibly
          scamola!  We would remember if we got married.
Amber:    Boy, you did have a lot to drink last night, Homeo!
Ginger:   Take a look at this.  [she hands Homer a video]
Homer:    Aw, precious memories.
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Sticking the tape in the video player, Homer sees both himself and
% Ned at a wedding boutique with the two cocktail waitresses.  Ned wears
% a 70's-style suit with gold chains, and Homer a hat and tie.

Ned:       I okily ... dokily ... schmokily do!
Minister:  And do you, Homer, take this cocktail waitress you just met
           to be your lawfully wedded wife?
Homer:     What did you call me?
Minister:  [sighs] Do you want to get married?  Married!
Homer:     Sure!  Sock it to me, baby.
Minister:  By the power vested in me by the Chicago Outfit, I now
           pronounce you husbands and wives.
           [Homer and Ned's new wives kiss them to electronic wedding
           music.  Back in the hotel room, Homer comes to a horrifying
           realization]
Homer:     We are so dead.
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Later, at the hotel restaurant, Homer and Ned sit at a table opposite
% their new wives.

Homer:    Ladies, we wanna do the honorable thing, so breakfast is on
          us.  With full waffle bar privileges.  But first, I'm afraid
          we have some bad news.  [sighs]  The waffle bar is closed.
          I'm sorry, I'm so very ...
Ned:      Homer!  The bad news, ladies, is we already have wives.
Amber:    Well you can't be very happy with them if you married us.
Ginger:   You two fellas are the nicest husbands we've ever had.  And
          we're not giving you up without a fight.
Homer:    But Ginger, honey, I am not the catch I appear to be.
Ned:      Ginger's my wife!
Homer:    Are you sure?  Oh, rats.  No offense, sweetie.
Ned:      Homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelets?
Homer:    Geez, I've never seen anyone so whipped so fast.  [makes whip
          sound]
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% At the breakfast counter, Ned is has a panic attack while Homer
% gathers some food items onto a tray.

Ned:      What are we gonna do, Homer?  My kids are gonna be
          traumatized!  And then there's Maude!  And then there's
          Maude!!
Homer:    I don't know, Flanders, having two wives could have its
          advantages.
          [Homer's imagination conjures up himself lying in a hammock
          while Marge and the cocktail waitress chop wood and dig a
          hole, respectively]
Homer:    Chop, chop, dig, dig, chop, chop, dig, dig, chop, chop, dig,
          dig ...
Marge:    You know, Homey, there's so much more two wives could do for
          you ...
Homer:    I hear digging, but I don't hear chopping!
-- Um, yeah ... they could bring you a beer and a lemonade,
   "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Just then, in his dream, a bee flies by.  "Ooh!  A friendly bee!" he
% says, until it sits on his nose and stings him, making him scream.
% Back at the casino, Homer holds his nose.

Homer:    Ow!  That sting hurts so much!  We gotta get out of this,
          Ned.
Ned:      Well do something.  This is all your fault.  You and your
          stupid program!
Homer:    Blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the
          Program!  The Program is rock solid!  The Program is sound!
Ginger:   Yoo hoo!
Homer:    Oh, those awful women want their omelets.
Ned:      Oh, how are we gonna get out of this mess in an honorable and
          decent ... [sees Homer running off]  Oh ... nuts!  [runs
          after him]
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Back at the table, Ginger is reluctant to eat the fattening omelet.
% Amber advises her to relax, since she's already landed a husband.  Her
% serenity disappears when she notices the guys making a break for it.
%
% To the tune of "Viva Las Vegas", Homer and Ned run from the
% waitresses into the casino and knock over a bunch of slot machines,
% whose engrossed users simply tilt their heads to keep playing.
% Pulling two janitors into a utility room, they attempt to beat them
% up, but things unfortunately end  up the other way around.  Crawling
% away in pain, they encounter their wives  once more and run back into
% the casino, where Gil tries his luck at craps.

Gil:      Come on, baby, show Gil a four!  [rolls dice -- snake eyes]
Dealer:   Craps!
Gil:      Oh, no, why did I bet the company payroll?  Oh, Gil's in a
          lot of trouble.
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Homer and Ned, hiding behind Gil's table, are spotted by both their
% wives and the Security Cameraman.

Amber:         Somebody help!  Our husbands are trying to ditch us!
Security Man:  Someone dishonoring their marriage vows?  Not in Las
               Vegas.  Attention all employees!  We've got two
               runaways.  Stop them!
-- They take marriage seriously in Vegas, "Viva Ned Flanders"

% The two are surrounded by men in black suits, Gunter and Ernst with a
% white tiger, Drederick Tatum, and the Moody Blues, who improvise a
% poem.

Graeme Edge:    Cold-hearted Homer ditching his wife,
                While ancient Ned runs for his life.
Justin Hayward: Chips of red, and blue, and white,
                But we decide, we ...
John Lodge:     Can the poems, it's arse-whipping time.
Ray Thomas:     [pulling out a knife] I want fatty.
-- That wasn't in the liner notes, "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Homer yells; our two heroes soon find themselves cornered.  Homer
% suggests switching wives.  "For the last time," says Flanders with
% some exasperation, "no!"  Eyeing a car on display in the casino, Homer
% figures he and Ned can use it to escape.  He jumps in the convertible
% and yells "So long, suckers."  His pause, however, gives the casino
% employees time to jump on top of the car and pummel the two.  Later,
% Tatum tosses the two past a sign that reads "State Line", into the
% desert next to the highway.

Security Man:  Get out and stay out.  Las Vegas don't care for out-of-
               towners.  Take your money and go someplace else.
Amber:         And don't you ever try to marry us again.
Ginger:        We found some guys that know how to treat a woman.
               [indicate Gunter and Ernst]
               [Gunter and Ernst glance at each other, while their
               white tiger looks about uneasily]
-- You sure can pick 'em, "Viva Ned Flanders"

% They walk off; Homer gets down on his knees.

Homer:    But Amber, I can change!
Ned:      Will you shut up?!
Homer:    All right, let's get our stories straight for Marge and
          Maude.  [the two begin walking down the highway]  We were out
          buying them fabulous gifts ...
Ned:      What's the occasion?
Homer:    Because we love them, jackass!  Anyhoo, we came out of Wal-
          Mart when suddenly, one hundred spaceships ...
Ned:      Homer!
Homer:    You're right, you're right, fifty spaceships beamed us
          aboard.  They gang-probed you, while I discovered an
          invention that blew their heads up and saved America.
Ned:      Uh, do I have to be gang-probed?
          [two vultures land on the highway behind them, first looking
          at Ned and Homer, then each other]
Homer:    Would you rather tell Maude the truth?
Ned:      [sighs] What did the aliens look like?
Homer:    Well, I only saw them from the back 'cause they were so busy
          gang-probing you.  Well hello, little birdie!  [fade to
          black]
-- "Viva Ned Flanders"

% Homer and Ned scream through the first part of the credits,
% presumably being attacked by the birds.  "Cover your eyes!"  Homer
% yells.  The credits roll on Vegas marquees, accompanied by the song
% "Viva Las Vegas".
