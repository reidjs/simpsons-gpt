   [If you use these summaries to determine if you found the right capsule,
   here's a TV Guide-like synopsis:  A labor strike by the local bag boys'
   union causes a food shortage in Springfield.  But Our Favorite Family
   doesn't care because, thanks to a prize in a box of animal crackers, the
   Simpsons are going to Africa! -- Ed.]

Couch:          One more time ... the family run on and do a chorus line.
                They're joined by a line of Rockette-type women.  As the
                camera pulls back, the back wall of the living room is lifted
                up to reveal elephants doing handstands on one front leg,
                magicians pulling rabbits out of hats, and other assorted
                circus performers.  The music throughout sounds as though it's
                from a circus.  [See "Comments" section for more -- Ed.]

==============================================================================

Rob Brown:
   ... SLH was uncharacteristically clever in this episode?
   ... Kitenge didn't seem to mind the dozens of mosquitoes buzzing around him
       in OFF's room?

Don Del Grande:
   ... either it never occurred to anybody to go to the Kwik-E-Mart, which
       doesn't use bagboys, or it quickly ran out of food?
   ... the guide in Africa sounds like a cross between Carl and Apu?
   ... Victoria Falls is rated with two black diamonds?  (That's a rating for
       the most dangerous ski runs)
   ... one of the monkeys is named Jojo, which is Bart's (unspoken) middle
       name?
   ... Lisa didn't have any diamonds at the end?
   ... Marge didn't comment about the things Homer said about flight
       attendants at the end, even though her father was one?

Joe Green:
   ... Homer eats decades-old food with no apparent ill effects?

Darrel C. Jones:
   ... the Pimple Faced Teen is old enough to vote?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the recycling bin outside of the supermarket?
   ... the cans of Pringles that the kids get?
   ... the rice at the supermarket cost $.59?

Haynes Lee:
   ... Marge's hair sticking out the Range Rover?  [Land Rover, actually --
       Ed.]

Jared Rasmussen:
   ... Homer buys a 6-pack of Duff, although he often keeps cases stored away
       in the garage?
   ... Homer fills two shopping carts full of food and they get transferred
       into only three paper bags?
   ... a set of skis from "Little Big Mom" in the attic?
   ... Homer blew the dust off the first animal cracker but no others?
   ... the hut where the Simpsons were staying was equipped with electricity?
   ... the elephant skull on the bay by the river?
   ... Lisa doesn't have any grubs on her plate, which makes sense since she's
       a vegetarian?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... no one thinks to do their shopping in some other city?
   ... Bart really hadn't said anything in a while when he asked the crowd to
       look at Bushwell's work?
   ... Maggie has made a tiara from her diamonds?

+  Homer usually shops for groceries at the inflated Kwik-e-Mart, not the gas-
   station.  {hl}

+  In past episodes, Homer sticks up for the little guy [...], but in this
   one, he's a jerk to the common working man.  [Jason Carney answers, "He was
   being a jerk to a BAG BOY!  That would be the common working 14-16 year

=  Homer's lunch box is hinged on the handle end, opposite to convention.
   {bjr}

*  The "Rumble in the Jungle" fight between Foreman and Ali took place in
   1974, so why is it pictured on a box of Animal Crackers that are from the
   '60s (according to Marge anyway)?  {rb}

*  The path to the "left" in the episode with the rainbow and the sun was in
   error.  The rainbow was on top of the sun.  A rainbow and the Sun are
   always on opposite sides [of an observer].  {db}

*  If the tribeswoman took the rings off their necks their necks would atrophy
   and die from asphyxiation.  {hl}

*  The lip disc is from a South American tribe.  {hl}

*  Rainbows can only be seen right after a rainstorm.  {dj}

=  When Homer pulls out the Animal Crackers box as a "map," the backside is
   blank (the side with the images of a lion being shot in the face, Muhammad
   Ali, and the zebras in the convertible).  {jr}

*  Victoria Falls is nowhere near where they would have been.  {ddg}

=  Bart's tongue is green as he compliments Ms. Bushwell's grubs.  ["I assumed
   it was from eating grubs," writes John Jensen -- Ed.]

   In the following shot it is back to being red.  [Note:  This is a goof if
   Bart's tongue was supposed to be green before.  It technically isn't a goof
   if his tongue was never supposed to be green.  Got all that? -- Ed.]

*  Diamonds that come out of mines don't sparkle -- they have to be polished
   first.  {ddg}

*  All diamond mines are near volcanoes or hot springs, and there were none
   near Dr. Bushwell's compound.  {dj}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Don Del Grande:  That was actually a pretty good episode, even with the slow
   setup opening -- and no copout ending, either (although why Lisa didn't
   take any diamonds wasn't explained -- maybe she's boycotting diamonds dug
   with the hands of animal labor?).  (A-)

Brandon Foster-Gray:  This has been the funniest ep. of all season, at least
   from the ones I have seen.  "The Simpsons" are back to being at their best.
   This is about the only show that I watch regularly, and actually attempt to
   watch.  The best thing is that as shaky as it seemed, this episode really
   did well with the continuity.  Bag boy strike -> no food -> animal crackers
   -> safari (well there's some steps in between there, but still ... Great
   ep!  BTW, can my review be put on SNPP?  :)  [Oooh, sorry, we just ran out
   of room.  Better luck next time -- Ed.]  (A+)

Joe Green:  A highly entertaining effort, with enough good jokes (like Homer's
   "reassuring" comment about being eaten by a crocodile) to compensate for
   the largely aimless plot.  On the other hand, I also thought the "surprise"
   ending was kind of lame.  And seeing as how I used to work as a bag boy, I
   sure HOPE that text at the end was nothing more than a joke ...  (A-)

Darrel C. Jones:  Another excellent episode.  While some of the jokes left
   something to be desired, the African jokes were funny (the witch doctor
   especially), and the ending was perfectly zany.  A classic, hands down.
   10/10  (A+)

Michael Nusair:  Maybe it's because there hasn't been a new episode in a
   while, or maybe it's because Teletoon's been showing episodes from seasons
   2 - 3, but Homer's voice sounded especially annoying tonight.  That aside,
   "Simpson Safari" was an okay episode.  The first two acts were quite
   entertaining, with a few scattered laughs.  I didn't much care, however,
   for the third act.  Diamond-mining monkeys?  I don't think so.  It's not
   really that it didn't fit within the context of the episode; I just thought
   it was stupid.  Anyway, this episode had a few laughs, and it was
   entertaining.  The plot certainly wasn't the best we've seen this season,
   but I guess you can't have everything.  [Original Grade: (B--)]  (C+)

Matt P:  "The Simpsons" actually was funny last night.  Really. This season
   has been a woeful disaster, but this episode proved there's still funny
   stuff for the Simpsons to do (which makes the many misfires this season all
   the more inexcusable).  Not a great episode, but a pretty good one, thereby
   tying one or two other episodes as best of the season, with a  (B+)

Mike Parks:  Stay in Springfield, Simpsons, the last few traveling eps have
   been awful, this one was no exception.  The first act was far more
   interesting than the rest of the show.  If the producers could have
   executed the act as well as they did the teacher's strike, this would have
   been far better.  The 2nd act was decent, up until the hippo point.  After
   that, the show seemed to deteriorate, relying on bathroom humor laughs for
   the rest of the show.  One of, if not the, worst episode of this season.
   (D-)

Mike Reed:  Another good effort from Swartzwelder.  (2 in a row, maybe he's
   turning it around) Light on plot and/or character development, but high on
   laughs, and that's what counts, right?  (B+)

Yours Truly:  This is one of those rare episodes that improves in the third
   act, when the Simpsons (and the audience) meets Joan Bushwell, a chimp
   researcher with a secret.  Before that, we get a contrived (even by today's
   standards) opening, followed by some over-broad attempts by the Simpsons to
   go native in Tanzania.  Kitenge the tour guide was a high point, and I
   liked the attention the writers paid to Tanzanian landmarks and tourist
   attractions.  Supposedly, the word "safari" literally means, "hard
   journey."  Thankfully, this safari isn't a hard journey for the viewers,
   but had the humor been more sophisticated, it would have been a more
   memorable trip.  (C+)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B (3.03)   Std Dev.: 1.0864   (11 reviews computed)

> Comments and other observations
==============================================================================
>> Meta-reference corner

Haynes Lee:  The animal anachronisms (rhino egg, burrowing giraffe) is a jab
   at the critics in this this newsgroup.


Joe Klemm elaborates:  Lisa pointing out the biological goofs in the African
   jungle makes fun of how some people on a.t.s. point out the obvious goofs
   of incidents that can't happen in real life, but are put there for humorous
   purposes (example: the man eating elephant in "Skinner's Sense of Snow).


Benjamin Robinson:  After learning of Kitenge's promotion to President, Homer
   said that he had been wondering what happened to him.  This might be a
   comment on the way people wonder what happened to unresolved plot threads.


On the topic of self-referencing, Mike Reed writes:  IMHO, much of this
   episode was self-parody.  Sure, it wasn't quite BABF09 in terms of self-
   parody, but it was in the same vein.  It mocked several concepts of the
   writing of the Simpsons, such as exposition.

   Example 1: Narrator Lisa -- A common complaint around here these days is
   that (usually) Lisa will explain everything for the dumber viewers.  Here,
   we either got an episode where Lisa explained everything all the time, or
   where the writers realized this flaw and mocked it.  I'm betting on the
   latter.  First, she told Marge where their rooms were.  Then, Lisa
   explained that rhinos don't hatch from eggs.  Then she told Homer that
   hippos CAN stand water.  Soon, she told Homer to paddle to the left.  Then,
   she said that they were headed for Victoria Falls.  THEN, she told Marge
   that Dr. Bushwell was a woman. Finally, she explained that the monkeys were
   working as miners.  This is either a really crappy episode or a complete
   self-reference.  If it was a ref, it was well-done and well-hidden.  Once I
   figured it out, I was really expecting Homer or Bart to tell her to stop
   explaining everything (thus, explaining the joke and blowing the entire
   concept) but they didn't give into temptation and let the joke go hidden.
   Nice touch, IMO.

   2.  The plot-booster -- The bag-boys plot booster was a self-ref, but not
   in the obvious way the autopsy opener from CABF07 was.  It wasn't readily
   evident that it was, until it was brought up again in act III.  Normally
   plot boosters are never referred to later, but here it was, long after we'd
   forgotten all about the bag boys and their noble fight.  Not to mention
   that Homer kept going on about it despite the fact that they were lost in
   Africa.  (The second plot.)  I was pleasantly surprised that they did this.

   3.  (More) Needless Exposition -- Act three opens with Homer recapping what
   has happened before for no apparent reason.  I mean, everyone there knew
   what was happening.  (For them there was no commercial break.)  He was
   doing it for the casual viewers who might have forgotten.  This joke was
   also not ruined as it could've been: Bart could have said something like
   "Uh ... Homer?  We know" but didn't.  Whew!  Also note that the tour guide
   explained to Homer that the skeleton's age was what mattered, and Marge
   said out loud that the soles of Bushwell's shoes were covered in diamonds,
   despite the fact that we're seeing it.  Also, Bart's "I haven't said
   anything for a while" is probably what the writers were thinking when they
   wrote that line for him to say.  That's why Lisa didn't say it.  (Which
   would have been more in character.)


>> Musical References

R. Vain:  [The Simpsons are] Listening to Angelique Kidjo in the car.


Ann Speyer adds:  The few lines we hear him [the guide] sing are from the song
   "Wé-Wé" by Angelique Kidjo, a musician from Benin, West Africa. The song
   can be found on her album "Logozo," as well as "Keep on Moving: The Best of
   Angelique Kidjo."  And the English subtitles provided are NOT what
   Angelique's lyrics actually mean...at least not as far as I know!


Chad Lehman:  When asked to sing, Homer warbles a line from "Good Morning,
   Starshine".  [Paraphrased -- Ed.]


Jean Fontaine:  You can hear the Andante from Mozart's piano concerto no. 21
   in C major (K.467) when the family is having dinner at the chimp
   researcher's place.


>> And that's just for openers!

Benjamin Robinson observes:  Tonight marks an unprecedented *seventh* airing
   for the "chorus line" couch gag, going all the way back to 1992's "Lisa's
   First Word (9F08)."  Matt Groening supposedly said that it was one of his
   favorites.  Don Del Grande, who tracks the couch gags for us, notes that it
   is one of the longest sequences (meaning it can be used as filler if a show
   runs short).  [Indeed, this was a shorter-than-normal episode -- Ed.]  I
   suspect both of these reasons account for its popularity with the
   production staff.


>> Bagboys (and girls) of the world, unite!

"s17mil" remembers:  How many can relate to those poor bag boys on last
   night's ep?  I worked for King Kullen for two years (the store was too
   cheap to employ baggers, cashiers had to do it themselves) and there was
   this one woman who said that she wanted all of her things in one bag and to
   not make it heavy ... when Agnes said the same thing, I nearly died.


"woozywink" agrees:  I as well can relate to that.  Old women really do ask
   for the strangest ways off bagging.  Believe it or not, I as well had a
   woman say the same "everything in one bag ... but not heavy" thing to me
   ... do you think they have meetings and discuss which insane requests to
   yammer about?


Dave Syndoche:  Try working in an electronics store.  If I had a dollar for
   every old woman who came in looking for a "gadget" for some young male
   relative, or presents for their young male relatives who like "gadgets" I
   could probably buy something shiny.


Shi Bao Nai:  my local Kroger has a couple of "self serve" lanes, which I just
   absolutely love.  Nothing against bag boys or cashiers, but it solves the
   problem of having some idiot in front of you.  I'll never forget being
   behind an old woman who wanted all of her frozen items in one bag, but
   didn't want the bag to be heavy.  She had over 20 frozen items, including
   two full gallons of ice cream.  Frozen stuff is almost always heavy!  Then
   she wanted all of her canned goods in one bag ...

   The beauty of the self serve lanes is that I can get in and out without
   having to actually deal with another human being.  So when it's 7:00 and
   I'm surrounded by angry housewives and idiot children, I can just grab my
   six pack of Southpaw Light and a frozen pizza and check myself out.


>> Out of Africa

Benjamin Robinson:  The writers obviously did some homework for this episode,
   because many of the landmarks and tourist attractions in real-life Tanzania
   actually appear in this episode.  The Ngorongoro Crater, according to
   writer P. J. O'Rourke, is a 1,500-mile-deep chasm containing, "a miniature
   perfect universe of grassland and forest."  It is near Lake Victoria, which
   I'll assume is near the Victoria Falls that the Simpsons took a little trip
   over.  [However, "inc" was quick to point out, "The real Victoria Falls is
   actually about 1500 miles south of where the Simpsons would be" -- Ed.]  We
   also see Mt. Kilimanjaro (the mountain Homer suggests climbing), and
   Olduvai Gorge, where the Leakeys discovered the oldest humanoid skeleton.
   Finally, the native Maasai tribe has settled at least partly in Tanzania.

   With the revolving parade of national names and leaders, the writers imply
   that power changes hands frequently in Tanzania.  While this does reflect
   what goes on in many parts of Africa, Tanzania in reality enjoys a
   relatively stable and peaceful government as of this writing.


>> Car Watch safari

Joe Green:  Kitenge drives OFF around in a Land Rover Defender.  [{bjr} adds,
   "[the] durable but Spartan four-wheel-drive truck is practically the
   national vehicle of Africa" --Ed.]


Benjamin Robinson:  The Greenpeace "poachers" arrive on the scene in a black
   Jeep.  It looks like part of the beloved CJ-series.


>> And you thought your boss was tough

Benjamin Trollip:  When OFF escaped from the hippo on the river Kitenge
   exclaimed "Shaka Zulu!"  Shaka Zulu is the most legendary figure in Zulu
   history (at least as far as we were taught).  He led the Zulu race against
   the British in Natal.  He is famous for his 'Bull's Horns' formation that
   involved circling the enemy and for his unrelenting standards.  He made his
   soldiers run miles, barefoot over thorns to toughen their feet. Also his
   punishments were very severe; tree trunks were sharpened to a point, and
   his enemies were impaled on them.  At least, this is what I remember from
   my history classes about 5 years ago ...


>> If you're so smart, how come you aren't rich?

Justin asks:  In The Simpsons Go To Africa episode they come home each with a
   boatload of diamonds.  Why aren't they rich?


Don Del Grande answers:  Because, oh, let's say, Moe.

   I mean, because, oh, let's say, after they paid all of the taxes on the
   diamonds, the money was just enough to pay for the removal of the Matlock
   Expressway (or didn't you notice that it's not there any more?), or maybe
   uninsured Grampa ran his car into the Kwik-E-Mart or something.  (Or for
   all we know, Homer signed something at the power plant that says all
   precious stones obtained by the employees automatically become the property
   of Mr. Burns.)

   Bart and Lisa are rich enough as it is, thanks to their 50% of the T-shirt
   sales from the Krusty Komeback Special


Garry Wishart:  Because diamonds are worthless, the real money's in sugar.


Jason Hoehn:  I thought the real money was in grease.


S. W. Lucky:  All of the Simpsons are experts at finding next and better ways
   to lose money.  Perhaps all the money they made from the diamonds just went
   to pay one of the unpaid debts from some other show.


Gyumaoh:  Homer traded them for magic beans.


Someone named Yama has a Top, uh, Seven list:

   1.  Someone stole them

   2.  Someone offered Homer 20 dollars for them

   3.  They were actually cubic zirconiums (...conia?)

   4.  Homer ate them

   5.  They ended up between the floorboards

   6.  The Animal Crackers Company demanded the diamonds in return for the
   trip to Africa

   7.  They did keep them.  They [the family] are in the Homertime house, only
   returning to the regular house to record new episodes


Finally, Aaron "Space Museum" Hirshberg asks:  Why didn't one of you
   knuckleheads say:  "Wizard"?

Mike Reed:

   Voice-Over: Can the Simpsons survive in Africa?
   Homer: I'll need two seats on the plane, for the twins!
   Bart & Lisa: Are we insane yet?/Are we insane yet?
   Homer: I told you, yes!

   Bart: Maybe he'll lead us to bananas!

Joe Green adds:  Fox's print ads for this episode showed Homer saying "I'm

==============================================================================
% Homer, Bart, and Lisa go grocery shopping for the family.  It turns
% out that the Simpson family doesn't live on bread alone.

Homer:	[reading list] "Olive oil, asparagus" ... if your mother 
	wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like 
	normal people.
Bart:	[holding up a bag of candy] I need this candy for school.  
	[Homer looks doubtful] Candy class.
Homer:	Well, okay, but get five bags in case I eat four on the 
	way home.
	[Bart dumps some additional bags in the cart]
Lisa:	My teacher said I need cupcakes.  Cupcakes to learn.
Homer:	In the cart.
Bart:	[toting a big ol' bottle of wine] I'm out of wine.
Homer:	Cart.
	[soon, Homer is pushing two full grocery carts.  The kids 
	bring up more snack food]
Lisa:	We need these because, we have to ... [trails off]
	[they just toss them in the carts]
Homer:	[holds up a six-pack of that wonderful Duff] My doctor 
	says and my garage mechanic agrees that--
Bart:	In the cart.
Homer:	Woo-hoo!
-- "Simpson Safari"

% Homer discovers that food shopping can be kind of fun.  "Yeah," Bart
% agrees, "I wish Maggie had to go to the emergency room more often." 
% At that moment, the scene shifts to one of Springfield General's
% examining rooms.  Maggie stands behind an X-ray machine, which
% reveals that she has somehow swallowed an entire magazine.  Marge
% tells Hibbert that it was an issue of "Time," if that matters. 
% Hibbert becomes concerned, not about the baby's condition (she seems
% fine), but because the front page of the Maggiezine has an article
% about hard-liners gaining influence in Syria.
%
% Back at the store, Homer and the other two kids are in the check-out
% line.

Homer:		Wait -- I changed my mind.  Stack it in the order 
		I'll eat it driving home.
Bag Boy 1:	Sir, please!  I already bagged it by color, and in 
		order of each item's discovery by man.
Homer:		Customer's always right; that's what everybody likes 
		about us.  Now, mush!  [claps hands twice]
Agnes:		You tell him, Jumbo!  [to her lane's bag boy] And 
		you, start over!  I want everything in one bag.
Bag Boy 2:	Yes, ma'am.
Agnes:		But I don't want the bag to be heavy.
Bag Boy 2:	I don't think that's possible.
Agnes:		What are you, the Possible Police?  Just do it.
Moe:		[to his lane's bag boy] Hey, hey, watch what you're 
		doing there, sack monkey.  You're bruising my 
		DuraLog.
Homer:		[poking Bag Boy 1 with a stick] Hurry up!  I can't 
		stand here jabbing you all day.
Bag Boy 1:	Ow!  Stop.  Bag boys have feelings, too, you know.
Homer:		No, you don't.
Manager:	Eh, excuse me.  Is there a problem here?
Homer:		No, I can handle it.  [sotto voce to Bag Boy 1] I'll 
		get you, squealer.
Bag Boy 1:	That's it.  On behalf of Sack Stuffers Local 199, 
		I'm calling a strike!
-- You have nothing to lose but your chains!  "Simpson Safari"

% The bag boy jumps up on the counter and quickly gains the support of
% the other baggers.  Homer is unconcerned.  The strike gains
% momentum, though, picking up support from unions of fruit packers
% and unpackers, shelf dusters, and even unattractive waitresses.  To
% back up their demands, the strikers use long poles to knock the
% groceries out of the customers' hands as they try to leave the
% store.
%
% The intimidation tactics work, at least in the Simpsons household,
% where the cupboards are almost bare.

Homer:	So hungry.  There's gotta be some food left.  [pulls a 
	couple of cans out of one of the cabinets, and reads their 
	labels] Gopher jerky?  Cream of toast?  Where did we get 
	all this crap?
Marge:	Most of it was sent by relatives who couldn't see very 
	well.
Bart:	[looking in through the kitchen, holding up a birds' nest]
	Hey, I found some eggs!  The mother abandoned her nest.
	[a large black bird flies up to Bart and pecks at him 
	aggressively, knocking him to the ground]
-- That must be the father bird, then, "Simpson Safari"

% Santa's Little Helper catches the scent of some food, and starts to
% sneak away.  The rest of the family notices this, and tries to
% follow him.  SLH tries to misdirect the family, and then makes a
% dash to the attic.  He opens a trunk and pulls out a lunchbox. 
% Before he can eat his prize, Homer snatches the box away with a
% triumphant "yoink!"  The box is Homer's old "Burke's Law" lunchbox,
% and it contains an equally ancient box of animal crackers.  Homer
% ignores Marge's warning for caution and wolfs them down.  When he
% bites into one of them, he winces in pain.  It turns out the box
% contains more than just stale cookies.

Bart:	Whoa, a solid gold animal cracker.
Lisa:	[reading box] "Find the golden giraffe and we'll send you 
	and your family to Africa!"
Homer:	Africa!  They're bound to have food there!
-- "Simpson Safari"

% Homer heads down to Animal Cracker HQ to claim his prize.  The
% executives are a little reluctant to make good on their promise.

Homer:	... and on my free African safari I want to everything on 
	this box.  I want to shoot a lion in the face, fight 
	Muhammad Ali, and ride in a convertible with two happy 
	zebras.
Exec 1:	Sir, that contest ended thirty years ago.  We don't even 
	make animal crackers any more.
Exec 2:	We make household poisons and Christmas lights.
Homer:	[holding the box up] Your box made promises of a 
	vacational nature, and I expect you to live up to them.
Exec 3:	We won't, though.
Exec 1:	Sir, with all due respect, an old box of cookies is not a 
	legal contract.
	[suddenly, the string on the cracker box breaks, and the 
	box swings into Homer's face]
Homer:	Ow!  My eye!
	[the executives huddle]
Exec 1:	We are in big trouble.
Exec 2:	He could sue us.
Exec 3:	This defective string ...
Exec 1:	... Yeah, it's got very sharp corners ...
	[they break huddle and turn to Homer]
	Mr. Simpson, we've decided to make good on your vacation.
Homer:	Woo hoo!  [sotto voce] Hey, mister.
Exec 1:	Yes?
Homer:	On the plane, I'm going to need two seats, [points to his 
	rump] for the twins.
-- They never go anywhere alone, "Simpson Safari"

% Homer gives the happy news to his family.

Homer:		The Simpsons are going to Africa.
Family:		Yay!
		[meanwhile in Africa, two tribesman dance around a 
		fire.  Suddenly, one of them stops]
Tribesman:	What is it, N'gungo?
N'gungo:	Evil is coming.
Tribesman:	What shall we do, N'gungo?
N'gungo:	[puts his mask on the other tribesman's head] You 
		are N'gungo now!  [runs away]
-- Something wicked this way comes, "Simpson Safari"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  5:39]
%
% As they fly to their destination, Lisa likens Africa to a beautiful
% jewel.  Marge is more impressed with some musical garment bags she
% sees in the in-flight catalog.

Attention passengers -- please prepare for our landing in Tanzania.  
[someone in the cockpit hands her a note] I'm sorry, it is now called 
New Zanzibar.  [she is given another note] Excuse me, it is now called 
Pepsi presents New Zanzibar.
-- Flight Attendant, "Simpson Safari"

% The Simpsons meet their guide at the airport.

Kitenge:	Hello, hello, Simpsons.  Welcome to Africa.  I am 
		your guide, Kitenge.
Family:		Hey, how you doin' there?  Hi, etc.
Lisa:		Isn't that cute?  A bushbaby.  [indicates the animal 
		on Kitenge's shoulder]
Kitenge:	Where?  [notices the bushbaby for the first time] 
		Ahh!  Shoo!  Shoo!  [it leaves] Oh, man, I just 
		bought this shirt.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% The family piles into Kitenge's truck and drives past a series of 
% billboards extolling a man named Muntu.

Marge:		Who's Muntu?
Kitenge:	He is our leader.  He seized power in a bloodless 
		coup -- All smothering.
Marge:		Just like Jimmy Carter.
-- Indeed, like all good politicians, "Simpson Safari"

% Kitenge and the Simpsons pull up in front of a large boarding house
% atop a tree, where they will be staying.  A porter says he'll be
% down for the luggage but Homer tries tossing it up to him.  The
% luggage falls short of its mark and lands in a spider web.  An
% enormous spider sprays venom on the suitcase, shrinking it to a
% quarter of its original size.  Homer takes the incident in stride.
%
% At night, Bart tries to shoo away the mosquitoes buzzing around his
% bed.

Bart:		Help!  Ooh, this mosquito net's not working.
Kitenge:	No, no, you have it inside-out.  [rearranges it so 
		all the mosquitoes are now on the outside] There.
Lisa:		When do we get to see the animals?
Kitenge:	In the morning, little one.  Now goodnight, and 
		don't let the bedbugs paralyze.  [turns out the 
		light]
Marge:		Homey, did you remember to tip Kitenge?
Kitenge:	No he did not.
-- Note to self:  Always tip Kitenge, "Simpson Safari"

% Next morning the family starts their safari.  Bart has a book with
% pictures of animals in it.  When he sees one, he marks its picture
% with an "X."

Bart:	All right!  I got another one.  [marks a picture of a 
	warthog]
Lisa:	Hey, you didn't see a warthog.
Bart:	I'm looking at one right now.
Lisa:	Mom, Bart implied I was a warthog!
Marge:	Nobody's a warthog.
Bart:	What about him?  [camera pulls back to reveal a warthog 
	sitting just to Lisa's left]
Lisa:	Aghh!
Bart:	[laughs]
-- "Simpson Safari"

% Marge marvels at the spectacular African scenery.  Homer is more
% impressed that the truck's odometer has rolled over to 10,000.  (He
% even takes a picture.)
%
% Kitenge rolls to a halt in a nature preserve.

Kitenge:	And now we sit quietly and wait for nature to unveil 
		herself.
		[a rhinoceros hatches from a large egg]
Lisa:		Wait, rhinos don't come from eggs.
Homer:		What did you just see, Lisa?
Lisa:		I know, but--
Homer:		[insistent] What did you just see?
		[a giraffe sticks its head up through what looks 
		like a prairie dog hole]
Lisa:		Oh, now, come on.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% Kitenge points out a cheetah sitting by a tree.  Marge looks at it
% through binoculars, and says that it doesn't look that fast.  Think
% again.  In the time it takes her to say this and put down her
% binoculars, the cheetah has run right up to her.
%
% As the group drives to their next destination, Kitenge invites Homer
% to sing along to some African music.  Homer does his best, singing
% the nonsense-part of "Good Morning, Starshine."  Kitenge abruptly
% halts the truck.

Marge:		What?  What is it?
Kitenge:	Hmmm, poachers.
		[cut to three men putting a cheetah in a cage]
Lisa:		[gasps] That's terrible.
Homer:		Now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the 
		balance.  Whenever there are so many species that 
		people get confused and angry, a poacher is born.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% Kitenge fires a shot with his rifle, which scares the poachers away. 
% The cheetah uses the distraction to escape.
%
% With that unpleasantness out of the way, the safari party arrives at
% Olduvai Gorge.

Kitenge:	This is the earliest known fossil of a human being.  
		[indicates a skeleton half-buried in the sediment]
		It's over two million years old.
Homer:		Pffft.  I've got more bones than that guy.  If 
		you're trying to impress me, you've failed.
Kitenge:	It's not the number of bones, sir, it's the--
Homer:		[insistent] You have failed.
-- Indiana Homer, "Simpson Safari"

% The Simpsons visit a Maasai village.  They sit by the campfire with
% the village chieftain drinking a traditional Maasai beverage from
% cups.  Marge asks what kind of blood they are drinking and the
% family does a spit-take when Kitenge tells them it's cows' blood. 
% The villagers find this uproarious.
%
% Lisa and Bart show off some of the body adornments the Maasai gave
% them -- neck rings for the former, and a lip disc for the latter. 
% Later that night, the family goes more or less completely native and
% dances around the fire with the Maasai.
%
% A fine day of frenzied dancing comes to an end when Homer tries
% playing the drums along with the village musicians.  Some of the
% "drums" turn out to be a hippopotamus, who doesn't take kindly to
% having his rear end slapped around.  The hippo gives chase.  Kitenge
% jumps on the hippo's back and covers its eyes.  He tells the family
% to run for it, and they do, but a river blocks their path.  The
% hippo bucks Kitenge and stomps him a few times.  When the hippo
% finishes with him, it turns its attention to Homer.  Grabbing a
% Maasai shield and spear, Homer directs his family to the river, on
% the theory that hippos hate water.  Using the shield as a boat, the
% family floats away from the riverbank.  The hippo tries to follow,
% but shrinks away from the water, just as Homer said he would.
%
% The family isn't out of the woods yet.  They are floating toward a
% fork in the river.  The left branch looks placid, with a rainbow and
% calm water.  The right branch is an ominous rapids flowing between
% banks lined with forbidding rocks.  Homer has a tough time deciding
% which way to go.  Lisa recommends the left fork and for the first
% time in the trip, Homer listens to her.  He paddles with his hands,
% but leeches -- one of them the size of a man's forearm -- quickly
% attach themselves to his arms.  Homer shakes them off, but as soon
% as he does so, a wind pushes the "boat" down the *right* branch of
% the river.
%
% [End of Act Two.  12:23]
%
% Homer soberly considers the family's circumstances.

Homer:	Okay, here's the situation:  We're hopelessly lost and 
	about to die.
	[a crocodile roars up from the river.  The family screams]
	Don't worry -- being eaten by a crocodile is just like 
	going to sleep ... in a giant blender.
-- Well, that's comforting, "Simpson Safari"

% Marge wonders where the river goes, so Homer consults a map.  It
% isn't that helpful, though, since it's just an outline of the
% African continent with a cartoon monkey head superimposed in it. 
% Despite this, Homer is confident enough to conclude that, according
% to the map, there is no river.  Marge keeps Homer from walking out
% of the boat.
%
% The family spots some natives peering at them from the jungle brush. 
% The natives decide to greet them by sharing some artwork, but the
% Simpsons misinterpret their intentions.  Homer chucks the spear at
% them, narrowly missing one of the men.  "That's not funny," he says. 
% "I could have been hurt."  His friend sympathizes.
%
% The family continues to float peacefully down the river.

Homer:	So, do you think they settled that bag boy strike yet?
	[the go past a sign reading, "Victoria Falls"]
Lisa:	Oh, no, we're heading toward Victoria Falls!
Homer:	Here's why they shouldn't get anything.  One--
	[the boat goes over the edge of the falls.  The camera 
	cuts to the base of the falls, but the Simpsons don't 
	crash on the rocks at the bottom.  Instead, they land 
	safely in a giant flower by the riverbank]
Homer:	Whew.  This flower saved our lives!
	[the petals close in on the family]
Marge:	Oh, no, it's eating us!
Homer:	Not a chance.  [pushes through one of the petals, and the 
	family walks safely outside]
Bart:	Wow, Dad, how did you do that?
Homer:	[slight disdain] It's a flower.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% The family trudges onward.

Bart +
  Lisa:	Are we insane yet?
                          Are we insane yet?
                                            Are we insane yet?
Homer:	I told you, yes.  Now, Bart, go to the top of that hill, 
	and see if you can spot our hotel.  [points to a large 
	mountain]
Bart:	Mt. Kilimanjaro?
Homer:	Go.
Bart:	[resigned] Okay.  [he takes only a few steps before a 
	chimpanzee jumps out of a tree, frightening him]
Marge:	A chimp!
Lisa:	Hello, little fella.
	[the chimp walks somewhere offscreen]
Bart:	Hey, maybe he'll lead us to bananas.
Homer:	Or more mouth-watering monkeys.
	[the family follows the chimp]
-- Mm mm good, "Simpson Safari"

% The family trails the chimp, even going so far as to swing from
% vines, Tarzan-style.  Along the way, Homer continues his rant about
% the bag boys' strike.  (He's against overtime pay, for the record.)
%
% The chimp leads the Simpsons to Dr. Bushwell's animal preserve.

Lisa:	This is the place I've read about, where Dr. Bushwell 
	lives among the chimps.
Marge:	Oh, isn't that sweet?  He named it after his wife.
Lisa:	No, Dr. Bushwell is a woman.
Marge:	Well, now I've heard everything.
-- Marge the progressive, "Simpson Safari"

% Dr. Bushwell and the Simpsons enjoy afternoon tea and snacks.

Marge:		It's kind of you to take us in, Dr. Bushwell.
Bart:		Yeah.  Thanks for the grub.
Bushwell:	Grubs.
Bart:		Whatever.  [happily eats another grub] Ah, there's a 
		burst of flavor.
Lisa:		Your work has really inspired me, Doctor, and I love 
		your sensible ponytail.
Bushwell:	Why, thank you.  [to a chimp] See, Jo-jo, she likes 
		it.
		[the chimp looks a bit put out]
Homer:		So I noticed your home smells of feces.
Bushwell:	Yes?
Homer:		And not just monkey feces, either.
Bushwell:	Could we talk about something else?
Marge:		I, I love what you've done with these poles.
		[Homer sniffs the air]
-- "Simpson Safari"

% Joan Bushwell describes her daily routine.

Bushwell:	Every day I get up at 5:30, watch the chimps, eat a 
		quick lunch of roots and water, then more chimp-
		watching.  After dark, I come home and think about 
		chimps until it's time for bed.
Homer:		You must be the most boring woman on earth.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% One of the chimps warns Dr. Bushwell of impending danger.  The
% poachers have arrived at the gate.

Poacher:	[using a bullhorn] Give us the chimps, and no one 
		gets hurt!
Bushwell:	Absolutely not!  [to the Simpsons] Will you help me 
		defend the refuge?
Homer:		Anything for these noble animals.  [watches a chimp 
		scratch his butt on a tree] So like us.
-- Some of us, anyway, "Simpson Safari"

% The fight is on.  Homer and Bart do fashion grenades from coconuts
% and use them to drive the poachers from the refuge walls.  They try
% to high-five one another, but their aim is off and the two slap each
% other in the face instead.  Marge and Lisa use blowpipes to shoot
% bees at the poachers' tires.  The stingers hit the tires with enough
% force to puncture their sidewalls and deflate them.  Then the
% poachers' Jeep inexplicably explodes.  Homer bends a tree into a
% catapult and places a monkey on it, ready for launch.  "Somebody
% light this monkey!" he yells, but the chimp doesn't think much of
% the idea and attacks Homer instead.
%
% One of the poachers breaches the camp's walls and starts putting
% chimps in a sack.  Lisa wrestles with him, and in the fight the
% man's outer shirt comes open, revealing a Greenpeace T-shirt
% underneath.  Lisa is understandably confused.

Lisa:		Greenpeace?
Poacher:	That's right.  And we're not leaving until we rescue 
		every animal here.
Lisa:		Well, if you really cared about chimps, you'd know 
		that Dr. Bushwell is their best friend.
Poacher:	Oh, is that right?  Why don't you tell her about the 
		diamond mine, Doctor?
Bushwell:	Diamond mine?  What are you talking about?
Poacher:	I'm talking about this.
		[there's a whistle hanging around Dr. Bushwell's 
		neck on a lanyard.  The man grabs and blows it.  At 
		this signal, a column of tired chimps walks slowly 
		out of a hidden diamond mine]
Lisa:		[gasps] The chimps are running a diamond mine!
Bushwell:	Why, what fascinating behavior.  I must document 
		this new activity.  [takes out a diamond-studded pen 
		and notebook]
Lisa:		[scolding] Dr. Bushwell!
Bushwell:	What, these?  Why they were a graduation present.
-- "Simpson Safari"

% One of the Greenpeace "poachers" estimates the mineshaft to be five
% miles deep.  In the mine itself, a chimp excitedly holds up a
% diamond he discovered.  His co-worker slaps it away, saying (in
% chimp language) that it's just a zirconium.
%
% A search of Bushwell's house turns up diamonds in nearly every
% possible hiding place -- and even on the soles of her shoes.  The
% Greenpeace man figures Bushwell is one of the world's ten richest
% chimp researchers.

Lisa:	How could you exploit your beloved chimps like this?
Bart:	I think we should look at her research before we condemn 
	her entirely.
	[everyone stares at Bart, dumbstruck]
	I haven't said anything for a while.
-- Better to be silent and thought a fool ... "Simpson Safari"

% Lisa takes a look at Dr. Bushwell's "research," but it doesn't
% exonerate the scientist.

Lisa:		These are just pictures of monkeys from famous 
		movies!
		This is disgraceful, Doctor!
Bushwell:	All right!  So I snapped!  You don't understand the 
		crushing loneliness and greed.
Marge:		Don't worry, Doctor.  We'll get you all the help you 
		need.
Bushwell:	[gradually becoming unhinged] No!  Don't put me 
		away!  [holds up two handfuls of diamonds] I'll give 
		you diamonds.  Everybody wants diamonds!  Diamonds 
		will make everything all better!  Diamonds!  
		Diamonds!
		[cut to the interior of a plane.  The Simpsons, 
		except for Lisa, are carrying an impressive quantity 
		of diamonds]
Homer:		What a nice lady.
Marge:		Very nice.
Bart:		Hey, Lis, check it out.  [holds two diamonds up to 
		his eyes.  The camera cuts to his point of view, 
		which looks like an image from an insects' compound 
		eye]
		Diamond-Vision!
Lisa:		Buzz off.
		[cut to normal view]
-- "Simpson Safari"

% The plane taxis past a billboard reading, "Hail President Kitenge." 
% Sure enough, it's their former tour guide, looking presidential and
% carrying a scepter.

Homer:	Hey, look!  Our tour guide got a new job.
Marge:	Hmm.  Quite a promotion.
Homer:	I was wondering what became of him.
Marge:	What happened to President Muntu?
	[Muntu emerges from the back of the plane, wearing a 
	flight attendants' uniform, and pushing a food cart]
Muntu:	I don't want to talk about it.  [tosses some peanuts to 
	Bart]
	[The Simpsons laugh]
Homer:	[through his laughter] He got overthrown!  Now he's just a 
	stinkin' flight attendant.  Hey, where's my pillow?
