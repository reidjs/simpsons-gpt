Notes: They're finally breaking me. This was a terrible season for
       syndication.

       The biggest offender is the handling of the LABF episodes, for several
       reasons. Beginning with that production season, the show has been in
       high-def (720p) and in widescreen. It makes use of the entire 16:9
       frame and is NOT 4:3-safe. However, the syndication package has
       undergone the pan and scan treatment to deliver a 4:3 (and standard-
       def?) version. If it is also available in widescreen in certain areas
       or at stations' discretion, I have not been able to find out. But I do
       know that it was constructed with some attention to the framing, as
       various shots in the 4:3 version are not simply the middle of the
       original picture. As an example, the blackboards would often be
       illegible with a center cut, but can be read in syndication. For
       specific notes about this, I have used an "F" (for framing) in the
       column of symbols.

       The resized Gracie logo, as seen in the HD/widescreen episodes, is
       seen in the same proportions here (but letterboxed!), even in the KABF
       holdovers. (KABF21 is the only exception, see also below.) Also, even
       in SD format, these seem to be available in 5.1 sound in syndication.
       Older seasons may also be available that way, but I only recently got
       the appropriate equipment.

       The other format change that occurred this season (KABF22 and up) was
       the switch to four acts instead of three. On Fox, almost every episode
       until then had commercials before the first act, and none before the
       credits; this was usually reversed in syndication, with a handful of
       exceptions in early seasons and then very many in seasons 17-19. With
       that trend, even the stigma of credits seemed to be acceptable to
       those preparing the syndication versions, so it was completely
       reasonable to predict that the 4-act format would work out for
       everyone if just left alone. How unreasonable I am. Instead, each of
       those 13 episodes combines acts 3 and 4 into one, and orphans the
       credits again. (There is no gap between the combined acts, and in fact
       3 episodes blur the line between them. Also of note are the two that
       call attention to their nature, LABF04 and LABF09; see the full text.)
       The other 8 follow typical old syndication trends. Unrelated to
       syndication but still interesting, the season 20 DVDs also treat acts
       3 and 4 as one as far as chapter stops are concerned, despite having a
       "spare". See my DVD guide.

       This has the additional effect of breaking the streak of seasons
       17-19. With one minor exception, episodes with no cuts had original
       breaks, and episodes with original breaks had no cuts. It was so nice.
       Now that's out the door. Special credits fare about as well as they
       had under 17-19, though, with a few replaced for no good reason either
       way; but whereas using the original breaks meant the special credits
       were safe, with little guarantee otherwise, now with the Spanish voice
       credits there is a little extra buffer to smooth the discontinuity.

       In addition to the changes above, the LABF episodes also introduce a
       new style of compression and expansion, which I'm terming "chunky". No
       longer are episodes sped up or slowed down nearly imperceptibly and as
       continuously as possible. Now much more discrete chunks are removed
       from largely motionless areas such as establishing shots and after
       lines. They are not worth detailing most of the time, but they wreck
       the flow subtly anyway. There is no common compression style as some
       recent seasons have had.

       I'll remind you about all of this below.

       In other news, the Spanish voiceover credits are still here (see
       scg-19), but now, to fit in better, they're in the same yellow MG
       handwriting font. The only exceptions are KABF16's, which are green to
       match the TOH credits, and KABF21's, which for some reason use the
       same white typed look as season 19.

       Finally, as usual, there is no production code in XDS, and no visual
       rating bug. The V-chip can find them, but a handful of ratings differ
       from the original broadcasts. Some may be in error.
       KABF17: was 14-DLSV, now shows as PG-DLSV
       LABF01: was PG-D,    now shows as PG-DSV
       LABF11: was 14-DLV,  now shows as PG-DLV
       LABF05: was 14-DLSV, now shows as PG-DLSV
       Three of them seem to downgrade the 14 to PG while keeping the
       subcodes, as if to say "it's PG now"; how LABF01 got worse I do not
       know.

         Selma: [as Queen] I've always loved you!
<0:01> % Marge: Ummmm...
                         wh-which one of us are you talking to?

 ~~
       % A pan is cut between Lovejoy's invocation and Homer's "amen"; the
<0:01> % actual cut is a closeup of three of the other guys first, then the
       % pan to Homer.


 ~~~~~    ACT II   <0:03>   (0:08)   5:01 / 5:09 *Chunky comp throughout

       F Marge's expressions are cut out as Lisa talks to the Disney lawyer.

 ~~
         Willie: I - I - I canna do it! [make construction paper heart]

<0:02> % He sighs and hangs his head.
       % Elsewhere, Lisa crosses the bridge (slightly cut). Then abruptly:

           Lisa: Let's see.

 ~~
         Lisa walks by "Grandma's house";
<0:01> % a bit of the Tex Avery wolf sighing and hanging his head is cut.

 ~~
       * Lengthier compression chunks include shortening of the dwarves'
       * mailbox, and a blink from Lisa after she lies down in the bed. There
       * are other, less notable ones too.


 ~~~~~    ACT III  <0:15>   (0:25)  10:36 /11:01 *Chunky comp throughout
        + ACT IV                           (6:55, 4:06)

<0:01> % Marge: Ohhhh,
                       I wouldn't be stuck washing costumes...

 ~~
         Director: Homer, you got the lead.
<0:02> %    Marge: [closeup] [smiles offscreen and murmurs happily]

         Establishing shot of theater, with music.

       ! Actually a bit of the establishing shot is trimmed too; the music
       ! starts on the director's line in synd.

 ~~
         Establishing shot of Moe's for the first cast party.
       % (Originally it has outdoorsy weather sounds, but in syndication, the
<0:02> % sounds of the party from the end of the cut are heard instead.)
       % Wide shot of people in the bar, then
                                              Homer speaks to Marge ("I can't
         wait for the reviews").

 ~~
<0:01> % About a second of Homer crying over Marge's dead body is cut.

 ~~
       ! Act break is obvious, but the cut blurs the line a bit (see LABF05).

         End of act 3.
<0:02> % Start of act 4: Wide salon shot, with Marge admiring her nails in
       % front of her face. Closer shot, then

         Marge: That's it, three stories. That's what we always tell.

       ! So yes, in syndication, the end of act 3 leads right to... the
       ! middle of that first sentence (the middle of "three"). The first
       ! half is heard over the end of act 3. Then:

<0:01> % She looks down and leans over.
         Maggie is seen tugging on Marge's dress.

 ~~
         Marge: The Fountainhead! [seen in closeup]
<0:01> %  Lisa: [seen] Moooom,
                               isn't that book...

 ~~
         Agnes tiger-growls over Ayn Rand (mistaking the picture for a man).
       % Shot of Marge.
<0:01> %
       % Marge: Sooooo,
                        anyway...

       ! Fairly abrupt in the cut version too. How useful too.

 ~~
         Mr. Toohey lets the blocks fall out of the cabinet, covering the
         babies.
<0:04> %         Pan as he walks past them to leave the room. Maggie pops out
       % of the pile and "thuck"s. Slightly trimmed is
                                                       a shot of his desk,
         panning from him to...

         Marge: Maggie's genius and creativity...

       ! "Maggie's" is not seen in syndication; the cut ends there, and that
       ! word is heard over the block shot.

 ~~
       * Many borderline chunky compression cuts in this episode, but a lot
       * of meaningful looks and walk-offs are missing around here. One such
       * is an entire closeup of Maggie before zooming out, over "babies and
       * (gentlemen of the jury)".

 ~~
       ! One more thing! Originally the act ending is silent from Maggie's
       ! shrug to halfway through Al Jean's credit, when "Time to Say
       ! Goodbye" starts up. Since the song has been shifted in syndication
       ! (of course; see below), the originally silent part is a reprise of
       ! the string section from a minute earlier until his name disappears,
       ! and the last 3 are silent now.


 ~~~~~    ENDING   <---->   (----)   0:48 / 0:48 +0:04 Spanish

       ! So yep. "Time to Say Goodbye" (a.k.a. "Ho-Hi") is the credits music,
       ! which originally starts with 4.5 seconds of the Exec credits to go.
       ! There are 4 seconds of buffer from the Spanish synd credits; the
       ! first half second is missing here, and the ending syncs up fine (the
       ! transition to the Gracie logo is the same). Oy.


 ==[ LABF12 ]========================================= Coming to Homerica ===
         CUTS: 11 seconds     GAINED:  6 seconds      21:15 / 21:21
                               Original opening

 ~~~~~    OPENING  <---->   (----)   1:52 / 1:52

       F In the couch gag, we don't see Lisa turn to face Sideshow Bob. See
       F LABF02.

 ~~~~~    ACT I    <---->  (-0:03)   6:17 / 6:14 *Chunky expansion throughout

       F In the TV promo for "The Drowningest Catch" and the Krustyburger
       F commercial, we don't see the circular frame of the TV(?).

       F Nor can we later read the billboard or Builder's Barn sign.


 ~~~~~    ACT II   <0:10>   (0:08)   7:21 / 7:29 *Chunky expansion throughout

         Marge: Maggie, now you have a nanny!
       %                                      Just like the ones Joe Piscopo
       %        and Ethan Hawke left their wives for! ...[to Inga, angrily]
       %        But hands off my Homie!
<0:10> %
       % Inga pauses, then gets a notepad out of her apron and writes, while
       % saying aloud:
       %
       %  Inga: Hands off the Homie. Got it!

         Maggie protests.

         Marge: Sorry, sometimes she's nervous around new people.

       ! You're not allowed to cut Joe Piscopo jokes! Anyway, the "J" at the
       ! start of her line is somehow heard over Maggie's protesting closeup
       ! in syndication.

 ~~
       F Much later, the Aquavit sign is framed out when Moe is saying he
       F doesn't mind the money.


 ~~~~~    ACT III  <0:01>   (0:01)   4:57 / 4:58
        + ACT IV                           (2:16, 2:42)

       F Gil is pretty much out of the first scene, if you have overscan.

 ~~
       ! The act break is between the dinner scene agreeing to build the wall
       ! and Quimby addressing the group of volunteers.

<0:01> % But about the first second of act 4 is missing and Quimby's line
       % looped over the end of act 3 in syndication.


 ~~~~~    ENDING   <---->   (----)   0:48 / 0:48 +0:04 Spanish

       ! Originally, the music began in the Exec credits, and it's heard
       ! there in syndication too, but restarts on a beat for the rest of the
       ! credits after the break. 4.5 seconds are repeated, and syndication
       ! offers 4 seconds more space to put it in, but the last half second
       ! (fade) is lost.
