> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
===============================================================================
In Homer's vision of Maggie's wedding, how did Homer manage to get the
coat of his suit on if he couldn't get his arms free to stick them in
the sleeves?  {ddg}

"Are you holding onto the can?" doesn't explain why Homer was stuck in
the candy machine, as he should have been able to just pull the candy
out.  {ddg}

After Ruth and Marge shoot the cans, there are four cans seen in front
of the fence; certainly the cans would have been knocked behind the
fence when shot (and where's the fifth can?).  {ddg}

Marge's hair is shorter than usual in the "date behind the Springfield
sign" scene; in "The Way We Was", when she put her hair up for the first
time, it was pretty much as tall as it is "today".

Each of the three handfulls of stuff Lionel Hutz tosses into the fire
contain the same things.

Where did Wiggum and Homer get the eggs?

When Ruth and Marge are heading for the State Line, they head back in
the direction from which they just came (otherwise, how did they pass
Homer and Wiggum facing the opposite direction?); also, how did all of
those police cars end up between Marge and the state line two miles
away?  (Of course, this assumes the sign "STATE LINE 2 MILES" refers to
an actual state border and not just some place called "State Line"
located in the middle of the state.  Besides, I was told once that if
the police are in pursuit, they can legally make an arrest anywhere in
the country.)  {ddg}

The police car doesn't start falling until it is well over the chasm and
has stopped forward motion.  {ddg}

The front door keeps changing places: {ag}

- Ruth comes over to borrow the sander, and the front door has a window
  in it (with 2 bars), and the hinges are on the RIGHT side.
- In the next appearance of the front door, there's no window, and the
  hinges are on the left side.
- In the next appearance, there's no window, and the hinges are on the
  right side again.

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Peter Stein: All in all, this ep. was OK.  Not as good as "Rosebud," but
    tons better than "Homer Goes To College."  Highlights IMHO were the
    SH T KICKERS bar, the truth behind Homer's hair loss (plus giddiness
    and loss of equilibrium!), Chief Wiggum losing Marge and Ruth in the
    Badlands, and the Seething Sisters Bar.

Andrew Ross: I think I see the pattern emerging for this season.  They
    take one major cultural reference each week and try to make an
    episode around it.  So far, we've had the Beatles, Cape Fear, 70s
    college party movies, Citizen Kane, and now Thelma and Louise.  Not
    that there's necessarily anything *wrong* with this, but anyone who
    hasn't seen a particular movie may end up scratching his [or her -
    ed] head throughout the episode.  This one was neither magnificent
    nor bad, but just generically *good*.

Ron Carter: I am probably one of the few people in the world that has
    not seen "Thelma and Louise" and I still liked this episode.  Not
    all that many solid ref jokes, but still funny.  The Homer not
    letting go of the pop can was a little too predictable, but loved
    the running "Sunshine, Lollipops..." gag.  Some continuity loss
    makes it a B+.

Joey Berner: A strange one!  I liked it, there were some good gags (but
    nothing that really had me rolling) The first and second acts were a
    lot stronger than the third.  They seemed to run out of steam, and
    said, "Hey, let's just mock the movie for the rest of this!"  And if
    you didn't see the movie, how funny was this one to you?  (I did see
    it) I guess my grade for this one would probably be a "B".

Carl Frank: Never saw the movie (but knew the premise), and still
    thought that 1F03 was very good.  Highlights were the Public
    TV/Garrison Keillor reference in the beginning -- which had me
    wondering why all TV was not this funny -- the Quimby/Ted Kennedy
    line; the "Sister's" bar (and the kid who spoiled it); and the very
    end -- "oh.  .  .this must have have been pizza."  [...] Rating:
    B+/A-.

Jeff Briskin: The writing was flat, the story uninspiring, the pacing
    glacial, the jokes stale.  The whole thing seemed totally forced,
    predictable, "UnSimpsonesque."  I never thought there could be such
    a thing as a worthless 'Simpsons' episode, but last night's, IMHO,
    was the first, and hopefully, the last.

Tony Hill: This was a very funny episode, especially the Wiggum lines.
    The only problem seems to be that it's very fractured, lacking a
    strong subplot.  Even though it's a Marge & Homer episode, Bart and
    Lisa each get in their share of funny lines.  I give it a solid B.

Yours truly: I liked it.  A little contrived in parts: Lionel Hutz the
    babysitter, Homer meeting Wiggum near the sign.  Loved Bart calling
    Homer "Homina" and Homer speaking in a falsetto afterwards.  Fade to
    white when Wiggum drives over the cliff was great, too (straight
    from Thelma and Louise).  I give the episode a B rating.

===============================================================================
> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> The Garrison Keillor spoof

Warren Anderson observes, "The caricature was done quite well, with a
    couple of exceptions.  The most notable is that he does not read his
    monologues for his show (at least when I've seen him).  He seems to
    make a point of doing them impromptu, although he obviously has them
    well thought-out in his head.  In fact, his standard monologue
    position seems to be sitting on a stool, hunched over facing the
    ground, with his eyes tightly shut.  The dress was exactly
    right--black pants, suspenders, bow tie.  However, the few times
    I've seen him, he was wearing a red bow tie and red socks.  I can't
    believe they missed this!  The imitation of the delivery and voice
    were excellent.  They even got his audible exhaling into the
    microphone!"

>> The skeletal arm holding the Fresca can

Tony Hill says that this was "one of OFF's few brand-name refs.  Does
    this mean that Buzz Cola is a Coke product?  [...] Fresca was
    discontinued about 15 years ago and has not yet been re-introduced
    nationally, providing corroboration for the plant workers' legend.
    (It was always a blue can in the old days too.)

>> "I'm under the sun...now!"

Charles Don Hall notes, "Wiggum did a very good job of pinpointing his
    position.  Assume that he said "Now!" in the second that the sun
    passed overhead.  Since the Earth's circumference is about 20,000
    miles, and there are 80,000 seconds in a day, knowing the second
    allows the police dispatcher to calculate his latitude to within
    about 1/4 mile.  The Sun's apparent north-south motion is even
    slower, so his longitude could be calculated to even greater
    precision."

>> Music in this episode

Some of the music in this episode included:

    - "Entry of the Gladiators" by Julus Fucik at the circus [so that's
      what it's called!  Thanks, Isaac J. Prastein - ed]
    - "Waltz of the Flowers" as Homer looked at the ballet magazine
    - "Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet" at the ballet
    - Lesley Gore's "Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows"
    - Guns and Roses' "Welcome to the Jungle"
    - "Dragnet" theme at the end

>> More gender-benders

Andrew Ross notes of this episode, "Plenty of gender-benders for
    homersexuals: he thinks a makeover would be fun; wants to have his
    own girl's night out; he wants to hold Chief Wiggum (who wants to
    hold him back; is this going to be the next Burns/Smithers running
    gag?)  And speaking of Wiggum, what do you suppose was his mishap
    with the nonfemale inflatable doll?  Not to mention Smithers' desire
    for a little mincing at the ballet...aren't they kinda overdoing
    this gag?"  Let us not forget Patty dismissing ballet as "girls'
    stuff."

        as "Out With Gout '88" and "Let's Save Tony Orlando's House."
        Folks, do you realize without your support, public television
        can't afford to bring you such award-winning shows as "Edward
        the Penitent"?

Doctor: Mr. Simpson, you _do_ realize this may result in hair loss,

% As he reaches up the slot, Carl warns him that someone lost an arm
% doing the same thing, but Homer passes it off as an old wives' tale.

Flanders: Howdily-doodily-do!
           [Homer hangs up]
          Hello?  Y'ello!  Hellodily-odily!
-- Maybe some other night, "Marge on the Lam"

% Homer hasn't given up yet.

Homer: Fine.  I can have a great time all by myself.
 Lisa: Hey Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a
       babysitter.
Homer: Oh, Lisa.  Haven't you seen "Home Alone"?  If some burglars come,
       it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation.
 Bart: You're absolutely right, Homer.  We don't need a babysitter!
Homer: [suspicious] Wait a second...
        [Pulls a paper from his pocket: "Always do the opposite of what
       Bart says"] Hmm...you kids _do_ need a babysitter!
 Bart: Blast that infernal card!  [to Homer] _Don't_ give that card to
       me.
Homer: Here you g -- [pulls back] No!
-- Just before Homer leaves, "Marge on the Lam"

% The doorbell rings, and Homer answers it.

 Hutz: Mr. Simpson, I was just going through your garbage, and I
       couldn't help overhearing that you need a babysitter.  Of course,
       being a highly-skilled attorney, my fee is $175 an hour.
Homer: We pay eight dollars for the night, and you can take two
       popsicles out of the freezer.
 Hutz: Three.
Homer: Two.
 Hutz: OK, two.  And I get to keep this old bird cage.
Homer: Done!
 Hutz: [proudly] Still got it.
-- "Marge on the Lam"

% Marge and Ruth head off to a bar called "Shot Kickers", where,
% predictably, the "o" is burned out.  Inside, Marge joins in a country
% line dance.  {The first shot inside the bar is shortened by a second
% in syndication.}  Willy rides the mechanical bull.  After the dance,
% Marge is approached by a largish man.

Cowboy: Hey, baby!  Feel like gettin' lucky?
 Marge: I _am_ lucky.  I have a husband and three wonderful children.
        Thank you very much.
Cowboy: {[threatening] Listen, baby, I _always_ get what I want.}
 Marge: {[indignant] I said no!}
Cowboy: {Oh, did you?  Oh, I completely misunderstood.  Please accept
        our apologies.}
-- A true redneck gentleman, "Marge on the Lam"

% Homer has decided to head to Moe's.

Homer: Sometimes, you gotta go where everybody knows your name.
        [walks into Moe's] Hey guys!
        [No one answers; the fan squeaks]
       Moe, get the darts.  I want to play.
  Moe: No.  We're phasing out the games; people drink less when they're
       having fun.
-- Cause and effect, "Marge on the Lam"

% {At the Simpson house, Bart and Lisa watch "LA Law" with Lionel Hutz.}

{Oh, sure, like lawyers work in big skyscrapers and have secretaries.
Look at him!  He's wearing a belt.
 [wistfully] That's Hollywood for ya.}
-- Lionel Hutz on "LA Law", "Marge on the Lam"

% {The next stop for the ladies is an underground club, "The Hate Box".
% The clientele seems to be mostly punk rockers and weirdos.  Inside, a
% punk woman with a purple mohawk asks Marge, "Don't you think your
% hair's a bit much?"  Otto greets Marge as well.}

Otto: {Hey, Mrs. Simpson!  You should try one of these "Smart Drinks."
       [laughs and drinks it]
      Ooh, wow...I've wasted my life!}
-- Otto, realization dawning, "Marge on the Lam"

% {Diamond Joe Quimby is also at the club -- with no shirt on, and paint
% blotches on his body.}

Quimby: {Would you, er, like to dance?}
 Marge: {Mayor Quimby!  What are you doing here!}
Quimby: {I'm, er, here with my nephews.}
-- Remind you of anyone?, "Marge on the Lam"

% {Homer is in the Kwik-E-Mart, and he notices a "Jet" magazine.  He's
% delighted to discover it's Garrett Morris' birthday, but Apu kicks him
% out, curtly informing him, "This is not a library."  At the library,
% the librarian does the same thing, informing him, "This is not a Kwik-
% E-Mart".}
%
% Meanwhile, the two women have stopped the car in a field.

Marge: What was it you wanted to show me?
 Ruth: This.  [pulls a gun]
Marge: [gasps] You're not going to hunt me for sport, are you?
-- No, for meat, "Marge on the Lam"

% Ruth tells her to relax.  "I'd never turn a gun on a human being.  My
% husband, on the other hand --" She pulls the trigger a few times,
% aiming for (and hitting) a set of old cans perched on a fence.  She
% offers the gun to Marge, who refuses at first, but then takes it and
% fires it, hitting one of the remaining cans.  "I hit it!  I hit i!"
% she exclaims, but a man appears, mourning, "My cans!  My precious
% antique cans!"
%
% Ruth suggests they turn in, but Marge insists, "It's only midnight.
% Come on!  I know a place."  They go to a hill where the word
% "SPRINGFIELD" is spelled in giant letters.  They gaze down at the
% lights of the city below.

Marge: Beautiful, huh?  Homer and I used to come up here on dates.
        [Flashback to said date, where Homer brandishes a thick stick]
       Homer, stop that!  It's just a weather station.
Homer: Come on, Marge!  It's fun to smash things.  [hits it] Heh heh, I
       smashed it good!  [laughs some more]
        [to Marge] You got real purty hair...
-- A hopeless romantic, "Marge on the Lam"

% Ruth confesses, "Of all the places we've been tonight, I think I like
% this one the best," and Marge concurs.

 Ruth: [pointing] Look, you can see our houses.
Marge: Hmm.  There's an awful lot of black smoke coming from my chimney.
 Lisa: Mr. Hutz, why are you burning all your personal papers?
 Hutz: As of this moment, Lionel Hutz no longer exists.  Say hello to
       Miguel Sanchez!
-- Lawyers can change legal names easily, "Marge on the Lam"

Marge: Maybe we should call it a night.
 Ruth: OK.  I _should_ get home to my daughter before that naked talk
       show comes on.
-- The one with bacon on the beach?, "Marge on the Lam"

% Homer happens by as the two drive off, and he sighs, "Ah: young love."

 Homer: The old make-out place.  Hey, a new weather station!  I'll bash
        it good!  [sighs] Oh, it's just no fun without Marge.
Wiggum: Ah, there's nothing like moonshine from your own still.
        [notices Homer] Oh, Simpson!  [tosses the moonshine] What are
        you doing here?
 Homer: [bitter] My wife is having a girls' night out.
Wiggum: Aw, just get one of those inflatable women.  But make sure it's
        a woman, though, because one time I...heh.
-- Another story not suitable for children, "Marge on the Lam"

% Wiggum offers Homer a ride home.  On the road, Wiggum pulls slowly up
% behind a blue convertible.  "Hmph.  Their left taillight's a little
% smaller than their right one.  I better pull 'em over," he says,
% turning on the siren and the flashing lights.
%
% In the blue convertible, Marge sees the police car and says, "I think
% they want us to stop."  But Ruth is unwilling because the convertible
% is stolen.  So she guns it, speeding ahead of the pursuing cop.
% "Looks like we got ourselves an old-fashioned car chase," grins
% Wiggum, putting in a tape and singing along.  "Sunshine, lollipops and
% rainbows: everything that's wonderful is what I feel when we're
% together.  Brighter than a lucky penny; when you're near the
% rainclouds disappear and I feel fine..." Homer joins in the singing.
%
% [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:25]
%
% Wiggum is still in hot pursuit.

Marge: Ruth, is there something you want to tell me?
 Ruth: Remember when I said my ex-husband was behind on his child
       support?
Marge: Uh huh.
 Ruth: Well, to even things up, I kind of stole his car.
Marge: Didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the
       police?
 Ruth: Marge, you're the level-headed friend I never had.
-- Small consolation, "Marge on the Lam"

Wiggum: We're in pursuit of two female suspects.  One is wearing a green
        dress, pearls, and has a lot of blue hair.
 Homer: A lot of blue hair?  Hee hee -- what a freak!
-- A freak that _you_ found her, "Marge on the Lam"

% But Homer figures it out...

 Homer: ...it's Marge!  She's become a crazed criminal just because I
        didn't take her to the ballet.
Wiggum: That's _exactly_ how Dillinger got started.
 Homer: [interested] Really?
-- You learn something new every day, "Marge on the Lam"

% Marge tries to make Ruth see reason.

Marge: I don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give
       yourself up.
 Ruth: Marge, it's a matter of principle.  I just can't let that
       deadbeat win again.  You're with me, aren'tcha?
Marge: [thinking] I should say something reassuring and noncommittal.
       [spoken] Hmm.
-- Reassuring..._and_ noncommittal, "Marge on the Lam"

% Ruth wants to be reasonable.

  Ruth: Look, Marge, there's no reason for you to get dragged into this.
        Once we lose the cops, I'll let you out.
 Marge: Well, I don't think they'll be that easy to lose.  These are
        professional lawmen, and --
         [Ruth turns the car's lights off]
Wiggum: Oh my God!  It just disappeared.  It's a ghost-car!  [slams on
        the brakes]
        There are ghost-cars all over these highways, you know.
 Homer: [timid] Hold me.
Wiggum: [conciliatory] Only if you hold me.
-- You first, "Marge on the Lam"

% A coyote howls, and the two men hold one another, quivering.
%
% Ruth lets Marge off at a truck stop, "The Seething Sisters".

Marge: [uncertain] Well, goodbye.
 Ruth: I'm...sorry about all this.  But you gotta admit, we _did_ have
       some fun.
Marge: Yeah...everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely.
-- "Marge on the Lam"

% Ruth assures her, "You're a good friend, Marge," as Marge enters the
% building.  Once inside, Marge is about to dial a cab, but she
% overhears some women talking.

 Woman 1: [to Woman 2] This cross-country flight from the law would be
          hell if we didn't stick together.
 Woman 2: Hey: friends _stick_ together.
 Woman 3: [to Woman 4] It's amazing how through all this adversity, we
          managed to stick together.
 Woman 4: If there's _one thing_ decent folk do, it's stick together.
Waitress: I hate it when the waffles stick together.
    Cook: Stickin' together is what good waffles do.
-- Philsophy in a truck stop, "Marge on the Lam"

% Ruth is getting the car gassed up, but before she can leave, Marge
% rejoins her.  "Marge!  What are you doing?"  Marge begins to explain
% how she considers Ruth a friend, "and an important part of friendship
% is --" But before she can say "sticking together", Ruth speeds away
% with her as the sirens grow louder.
%
% (The siren is actually Kearney on a bicycle with a siren strapped to
% his head.  The owner reprimands him for driving away all the business,
% but Kearney is unmindful: "See you tomorrow, loser.")
%
% Homer and Wiggum are making breakfast on the cop car's engine.

Wiggum: Mmm, engine-block eggs.  If we can keep these down, we'll be
        sitting pretty.
         [Marge and Ruth whiz by]
 Homer: That's them!
Wiggum: Quiet!  I can't hear the eggs.
-- Wiggum the epicure, "Marge on the Lam"

% Back at home, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are asleep.  Bart is the first to
% awaken.

Bart: Hey, it's morning and Mom and Dad aren't home yet.
Lisa: Don't worry, Mr. Hutz is still here to take care of us.  [taps
      him]
Hutz: [wakes up, clears his throat] Don't touch my stuff!  [holds a
      knife]
      Hey, this isn't the YMCA...
-- Survival of the fittest, "Marge on the Lam"

% Homer and Wiggum have finished breakfast and are back on the road.

  Wiggum: Dispatch, this is Chief Wiggum, back in pursuit of the
          rebelling women.
Dispatch: All right, your current location?
  Wiggum: Oh, uh, I'm, er, I'm on a road.  Uh, looks to be asphalt...oh,
          geez, trees, shrubs...er, I'm directly under the earth's
          sun...now!
-- No need for GPS satellites, "Marge on the Lam"

% Bart and Lisa are watching TV, but their program is interrupted for a
% special bulletin.  Kent Brockman appears on the screen.

Kent: We've just received word of a high-speed desert chase.  The
      suspects have been identified as Ruth Powers and Marge Simpson of
      Springfield.
Bart: Cool!
Lisa: I always knew someday Mom would violently rise up and cast off the
      shackles of our male oppressors.
Bart: Ehh, shut your yap.
-- Bart Simpson, Male Oppressor, "Marge on the Lam"

% Brockman continues.

At the risk of editorializing, these women are guilty, and must be dealt
with in a harsh and brutal fashion.  Otherwise, their behavior could
incite other women leading to anarchy of biblical proportions.  [Pause]
It's in "Revelations", people!
-- Kent Brockman thumps the bible, "Marge on the Lam"

% Suddenly Brockman is cut off, and a still shot of Brockman with the
% words, "Technical Difficulties, Please Stand By", appears on the
% screen.
%
% Ruth and Marge, meanwhile, are only two miles from the state line.
% Ruth is convinced they're going to make it, but a whole lot of police
% cars appear, driving rapidly over the hill in front of them.  "My God!
% That must every policeman in Springfield," Marge opines.

 Ruth: I give up.  A single mother can't win in a man's world.
Marge: Ruth, that's a lot of hooey.  It's not over 'till it's over.
        [Grabs the steering wheel, making the car veer off the road]
       I'm sorry, I should have asked first.
-- Always considerate, "Marge on the Lam"

% Ruth is inspired by Marge's courage: "We really are going to make it
% now!"  But Wiggum and Homer realize something.

Wiggum: Oh, no!  They're headed right for the Grand Chasm!
 Homer: Oh my God!  They're going to drive right into it just to teach
        us men a lesson.  And it's all my fault!
-- A heavy burden, "Marge on the Lam"

% Homer grabs a bullhorn and leans out the window of the speeding police
% car.

Homer: [into bullhorn] Marge, Marge!
Marge: Homer?
Homer: Look Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband.  I'm sorry
       about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub.  I'm sorry I
       used your wedding dress to wax the car.  And I'm sorry -- oh
       well, let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this
       point.
Marge: [to Ruth] You're right: I _am_ lucky to have him.
-- Stand by your man, "Marge on the Lam"

% Homer begs Marge not to drive into the chasm.  "Chasm?!"  Ruth and
% Marge cry together.  Ruth slams on the brakes, halting the car just
% before it tumbles over the precipice.  Homer and Wiggum, on the other
% hand, aren't able to stop in time.  Fortunately, the nose of the car
% lands vertically in a big pile of garbage.

Wiggum: Hah!  And to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting
        this landfill!
 Homer: It's solid waste...I could kiss you!
         [kisses it] Ew...
         [kisses it] Ooh...
         [kisses it] Argh!
         [kisses it] Ooh...I think _this_ was pizza.
-- With bile topping, perhaps, "Marge on the Lam"

% A narrator explains the fate of the main characters.

Narrator: Ruth Powers was tried in Springfield Superior Court.  The
          judge dismissed her ex-husband's auto theft charges and forced
          him to pay all back child support.  Mr. Powers blamed the
          outcome on his lawyer, one Lionel Hutz.
          Lionel Hutz, AKA Miguel Sanchez, AKA Dr. Nguyen Van Falk, was
          paid eight dollars for his thirty-two hours of babysitting.
          He was glad to get it.
          Marge Simpson was charged with a violation of penal code
          section 618A: Wanton Destruction of Precious Antique Cans.
          She was ordered to pay fifty cents to replace the cans, and
          $2000 in punitive damages and mental anguish.
          Homer Simpson was remanded to the custody of the United States
          Army Neurochemical Research Center at Fort Meade, Maryland,
          for extensive testing.
   Homer: Woo-hoo!
