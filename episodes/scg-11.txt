[==========================[Season Eleven Summary]==========================]

Story cut episodes: AABF22, BABF13, BABF14, BABF16.
Compressed episodes: All episodes were compressed.
Missing lines: AABF21, BABF03, BABF08.
Added content: BABF06.
Changed content: BABF01, BABF09, BABF16, BABF19.

Total time cut: 21:28 (21 min 28 sec)
Story time cut: 2:27 (2 min 27 sec)
Total time added: 0:10 (0 min 10 sec)
Total time gained: 26:31 (26 min 31 sec)

Notes: Syndication has introduced something new in Season 11... "Expansion."
       The reverse of compression, it is apparently intended to fill-out
       time in episodes where cuts are made. 
            Also, new for Season 11 are the openings and closings for each
       episode. These are listed to give a complete feel for the duration of
       each episode. These will (eventually) be available for each season.
            Occasionally, there are lines which overlap the end credits that
       don't make it to the syndicated version, and they are listed as
       zero-length <0:00> cuts.

       Once again, as I am wont to say, enjoy. [-ed]

       ! There is a strange phenomenon at work in this synd version. It
       ! appears the syndicators used the reverse of compression, or
       ! EXPANSION in certain places. I thought it might be a glitch with
       ! the VCR tape dragging, but I checked the tape and there was no
       ! problem.  Acts I & II, thus, are slightly EXPANDED in time.
       ! After going through the entire season 11 in syndication, I've found
       ! that episodes getting cuts (other than the opening) are the ones
       ! which get EXPANDED. This is (apparently) to fill-out time created
       ! by cutting parts. Now, why are they cutting episodes? I'm guessing
       ! the new cuts are content-related--not time-related, since they've
       ! actually ADDED time in syndication. Once again, enjoy.

       ! Obvious cut, since the music from the scene cuts in late.  Why did
       ! they cut these few frames? My feeling is it was probably a content
       ! related cut.  The censors may have felt kids watching Bart walk

       ! Another expanded episode (which means cuts), but with a twist. This
       ! appears to be the first time syndication puts something from one act
       ! into another. They've actually edited the episode, putting a piece
       ! of Act III into Act II, then they cut it again when they got to Act
       ! III. It's clearly an attempt to keep the episode "making sense",
       ! despite a large cut. I do remember that in 8F07, a beauty parlor
       ! scene was swapped with Homer's video store visit, but that was from
       ! the same act. This was a heavy-duty edit here in BABF16. Enjoy.

         No sooner does the Simpsons' car jump across the tracks in front of

          Homer: D'Oh!

         The train just easily pushes the Simpsons' car down the tracks in
         front of it.

         Family: [screaming] AAAIGH!
