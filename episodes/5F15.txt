   [If you use these summarize to determine if you have found the right
   capsule, here's a TV Guide-like synopsis: When Bart outshines Lisa as the
   anchor on a new news program for kids, she is green with envy. Meanwhile
   Homer gets a pet monkey.]

> Title sequence
==============================================================================
Blackboard:     None due to shortened intro.

Couch:          The family sit down and a live action hand spins the picture
                around, ruining the paint work.

==============================================================================
> Animation, continuity, and other goofs
==============================================================================
= Milhouse stands fairly far away from the swing set, but when Bart asks if
  he's ready, he magically appears in front of Bart.

= Janey goes from hopscotch directly to jumprope in the Bart skateboard scene.
  {ddg}

= In a panoramic shot, Sherri and Terri were swinging the jumprope for an
  unnamed girl, but when Bart skates by, Janie is in the middle. {je} [Hmm,
  this Janie appears to be more than meets the eye. --hmw]

= How did Willy know Bart had landed in his pile? There aren't any windows
  on the side of his cabin facing the pile.

= Willy's door shouldn't have opened in. {th}

+ Since when does Willy live on school grounds? {th}

= The number of leaves from the pile decreases significantly when the pile is
  ruined. (It goes from a large pile, to a few leaves on the floor.)

= Bart's skateboard doesn't have any creamed corn on it after emerging from
  Willy's cabin.

= Nor does Groundskeeper Willy himself.

+ Willy's shack was behind the school but was visible from Bart's classroom
  which has been established in many eps and every blackboard gag to face the
  front. {th}

= The studio doors shouldn't have opened in either; we could see the crash
  bars when Kent opened them. {th}

= Bart's chair came from nowhere when he surprised Lisa. {je}

= The quote marks from the Animal Assistants shop sign have disappeared when
  Homer, Abe and Mojo exit.

= Before the first "Bart's People" the camera was focused on Bart even
  though Lisa was still reading her report. {je}

= Where did Homer's pizza come from during Bart's duck story?

c Heard - [nothing]
  Seen - Milhouse: Very touching {je}

* Memorial Day exists to honor those who have died in battle.  To be a
  veteran, you have to return alive.  Hence, veterans really do only have one
  holiday in their honor. (Lisa claimed they're honored on Memorial Day) {bjr}

= On the carousel, Kent Brockman was on one horse and there were three others
  empty. In the wide shot, there were more. {ji4}

= Presumably, Apu controls his wheelchair with his left arm (notice the little
  "stand" it rests on), but it doesn't move when the wheelchair moves and
  stops. {ddg}

= The "cat lady's" feet aren't shown walking behind the train.  How did she
  get there? {je}

= The envelope from Lisa's letter to Bart disappears.

c Heard - Homer: What do you want?
  Seen - Homer: Give him a break, Marge. {je}

= Mojo didn't type enough keys for "PRAY FOR MOJO" to be written. [Although
  Christian Kammerer notes: "Mojo's pressing of three buttons to say 'PRAY FOR
  MOJO' is a direct reference to the bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees) that have
  been taught to "speak" by pressing symbols that represent objects, concepts,
  and names on a computer. Most notable in this was the pygmy chimp named
  Kanzi, who had an extremely extensive symbol vocabulary." --hmw]

==============================================================================
> Reviews
==============================================================================
Rich Bunnell: The premise wasn't the greatest when I read the description for
   it last week, but the episode itself brought the idea out of the mediocre
   range and into the hilarious range. I was laughing for the next 5 minutes
   after the scene with the lady throwing the cats! The "Chocobot" show was
   also hilarious, with the line "Put down those entertaining Mattel
   products!" being a complete LOL line for me. Lisa wasn't bad, I don't care
   what you lame "KILL OFF LISA" people say. (Grade: A)

Chris Courtois: "Girly Edition" was a pleasant surprise. Bart and Lisa were
   pretty much in character (some of Lisa's smugness in Skinner's office was a
   tad unpleasant), the episode had a nice blend of wacky surrealism (the
   incident with Willy's shed), character humor (the sibling rivalry theme),
   and social satire. Sure, the news satire wasn't anything series creator
   James Brooks hadn't say 10 years ago in his "Broadcast News", but
   unfortunately, the point is still just as valid today. The Helper-monkey
   subplot was less successful, and wore out its one joke (the monkey becomes
   as lazy as Homer) rather quickly, but at least not a lot of time was wasted
   on it. And the crazy cat lady made me laugh harder than anything else all
   season. (Grade: B+)

Anthony Dean: For the most part, I enjoyed this episode, although the monkey
   subplot didn't do much for me, and I saw the "Kid's News gets canceled"
   ending coming from a mile away. I enjoyed the satire/commentary on fluff
   news stories, along with the "Chocobots" and Willy trying to kill Bart
   (again!). (Grade: B)

Nathan Mulac DeHoff: A pretty good episode overall, although some parts
   weren't done that well.  I liked the satire of the news profession, and it
   had some clever ideas (like Bubble Crum and the Chocobots).  I was also
   glad to see Itchy and Scratchy return, although the I&S episode that was
   featured wasn't really one of the best.  The ending wasn't all that great,
   though.  I liked Lisa using Bart's techniques against Willy, but the
   cancellation of Kidz News was very predictable.  As for the monkey subplot,
   it was pretty pointless.  I probably laughed a few times at it, but the
   episode certainly could have done without it. (Grade: B)

Jordan Eisenberg: Not bad.  Not bad at all.  I'd love to sit and try to yank
   the loose ends together, but there really are no flaws in this episode that
   haven't been cited in a previous review.  The two plots, while not actually
   tying together, did as much interaction here as any have so far.  And I
   thought Nancy and Yeardley did exceptionally good jobs.  The biggest
   standout, obviously, was the admittedly underwhelming return of Itchy &
   Scratchy, and for that I have to give Larry Doyle some credit.  The pros
   definitely outweigh the few cons (Which mostly involve Groundskeeper
   Willy's rendezvous), earning this episode an easy A-.

Alex Foley: Lisa is out of character at times, but Bart is well in. Homer's
   helper monkey sub-plot, while no way connected to the main plot, was funny.
   And we finally get Itchy & Scratchy back. (Grade: B-)

Andrew Gill: This was a rather good episode.  Making minor concessions for the
   exploding shack, the sappy ending and the monkey subplot, I've been pleased
   with this ep.  The debate between the news magazine and the news program
   still rages, and Lisa (and I) are losing.  Characterization was good, plot
   wasn't bad, and I liked the point. (Grade: B+)

Don Del Grande: Okay, the ending was a little telegraphed (Bart and Lisa get
   together, only for the news to be canceled), but at least they didn't go
   for the "obvious" ending of the producer telling them that they were being
   replaced by Nelson... (Grade: B+)

Tony Hill: This was a downright hilarious episode.  We got to see the best of
   all the main characters.  I knew that Groundskeeper Willy would somehow
   figure in the climax.  And I can't remember the last time we've had an
   I&S, let alone heard the characters talk. (Grade: A)

Joe Klemm: Not one of the good episodes this seasons. IMO, it would have been
   better if the main plot involved Homer's monkey, not Bart and Lisa doing a
   news show. (Grade: C)

Haynes Lee: Another mediocre episode. Homer being extra lazy is getting a bit
   irritating. (Grade: C-)

Jake Lennington: Girly Edition is much better than the horrid Trouble with
   Trillions from last week. I'm glad Itchy and Scratchy is back this week and
   it is nice to see Willy up to his killing self again. (Grade: A-)

Ondre Lombard: I'm not quite sure I'll fall into a popular category, praising
   the monkey subplot, but I absolutely loved it.  Granted, it was distanced
   millions of miles from the main plot, but it still was worth some good
   laughs.  The main plot, too, had quite a lot of funny moments, but dumps
   pounds of hot coal into the stove of "Lisa sucks" posts, given how
   concentrated Lisa is on exposing how dumb she thinks Bart is.  (Given how
   little good the redemption Lisa displays in Lisa the Vegetarian did to
   save her reputation and that episode, I doubt Lisa's redemption will do
   the same here.)  Larry Doyle's problem seems to be that he has Lisa acting
   very much so like a braggart.  She points out how great a student she is,
   and gives off the impression that she's superior to Bart in several ways.
   Unfortunately, Bart seems to be the victim here, as he wants to prove he
   isn't dumb and can be a professional journalist by going to Kent Brockman,
   from whom Bart learns the trade of faking sentiment towards rather trivial
   issues.  In the grand scheme of things, I think the plot works, and Lisa
   acting jealous and immature at a certain level would be believable (because
   she is after all, still, a child), but her jealousy and obsession gets
   carried away a bit far.  However, as we near the end of Season Nine, it's
   becoming apparent that Season Nine does a better job at being funny than
   Season Eight did, even if the characters and story fumbles. (Grade: B)

Andrew Milner: I wish they'd done more with the monkey subplot, and this is
   the umpteenth time we've had the "media integrity" theme (most recently
   "The Last Temptation of Krust"), but it was a pretty funny show. I was glad
   to see the early scene with Willy pay off at the end, and Bart's on-air
   monologues were on-target. (Grade: B)

Michael K. Neylon: Well, we had nearly 2.5 acts of acceptable stuff, then
   suddenly, the episode turned for the worse, drastically reducing how well
   this episode sat with me.
   The first 2.5 acts had some good material... lacking the tightness that is
   usually associated with good episodes, but nonetheless some good plot and
   character development, and some good jokes.  Lisa seemed a tad more devious
   than usual, but otherwise, no real problems for this part.  The monkey
   subplot could really have been left alone... provided the necessary breaks
   from the main episode, but nothing of value from it.  
   But then, when Bart arrives at the junk yard, and meets Willy, the episode
   took a turn for the worst.  Why did we need to put Bart in danger in order
   for Lisa and him to resolve their differences? This is quite a tired old
   gag FROM THIS SEASON ALONE, that it was hard not see it from an hour away.
   Lisa's sudden rescue, and her use of the Bart newstalk to save the day was
   forced and was an obvious way to get out of the episode, without trying
   anything different.
   Then, the final joke, the chocobots cartoon, was truly misplaced...
   looking back through the episode, there was a lot of extra time that they
   had so that they could have moved the parody of the cartoon (long version)
   right to the start of the episode... then, to close this off, the
   announcement of Bart and Lisa's show being canceled, and replaced by the
   Chocobots, with credits over a cycled sequence from that parody.  It would
   have been tighter, and gotten out with  the memory that we should have of
   this show - Kids News.  
   Ignoring the last 1/2 act, for the moment, the one thing that hurt this
   episode was tightness.  Jokes taking too long to set up, or trailing for a
   bit too long.  This is something that good editing can cure, but seems to
   have failed in this episode.
   Also, I have it from Matthew Kurth (who works in the television industry)
   that most of what the news crew had was beyond expectation, (For example,
   having wireless mics for outdoors, but requiring lapel mikes with cords
   for indoors).  Technical errors that you'd think that people working on a
   tv show would know about.
   Overall, a good start, but the Season 9 curse rears it's head.  6/10 for
   this season, 5/10 overall.

Jarad Nielson: I thought this episode kicked butt!  Homer's monkey didn't
   really seem tacked on to me.  It was a classic case of Homer abusing
   charity (remember Homer's stay at the Springfield Retirement Castle?), and
   the monkey gags were hilarious!  The monkey gags tied Homer, Marge, Lisa
   and Grampa all into this episode which otherwise would have depended
   entirely on the kids news show for laughs.  As for the kids news show, it
   was hilarious!  I've never seen a better spoofing of tv news in my life!
   Those of you who keep dogging the show seem to forget that it's a COMEDY;
   or else you're expecting too much.  People keep whining about intellectual
   matters ad nauseum; yet last night's show was a VERY intelligent spoof of
   television news.  People whine about it not being funny enough, yet that
   monkey was the funniest thing I've seen in MONTHS!  The problem may very
   well be the fact that when The Simpsons were new they brought a fresh
   approach to comedy, but now that they're on their 11th season, the same
   type of comedy - even if done just as well - loses it's impact because we
   know The Simpsons' style.  It's too bad so many have become so petty and
   demanding.

Tom Rinschler: A quite amusing story, with an excellent satire on the
   shallowness of news.  An episode notable for not only having an "Itchy and
   Scratchy" for the first time this season, but two (!) subplots, a Willy on
   that tied in at the end, and a highly amusing, if silly, monkey one.  It
   also featured an interesting study of the relationship between Bart and
   Lisa, superficially rival, but deep down, friends. (Grade: A-)

Benjamin Robinson: This is one of those shows were everything seems to come
   together.  The premise was good, and led to some fine satire of the
   television news industry.  Everybody, especially Bart and Lisa, was
   characterized well.  Plot elements were tied together nicely, and the show
   had a real ending.  Overall, a fine freshman effort from Larry Doyle.
   (Grade: A-)

Matt Rose: While there were a few things in the episode which were quite funny;
   all of it is lost for me in the absolutely inexcusable behavior of Lisa...
   this was like watching PTA Disbands all over again. I have always has a soft
   spot for Lisa Simpson, and to see this episode was very disheartening...
   This wasn't Lisa Simpson; this was someone who acted cold-hearted, egoistic,
   and downright selfish. Whoever wrote this episode needs a serious slap in
   the face... I don't think anyone should be allowed to write for the Simpsons
   unless you know how the characters are supposed to act; this was horrible,
   and it totally ruined what I thought was an otherwise decent episode.
   (Grade: C-)  Would get about a B+ if not for Lisa's grossly blatant
   mischaracterization)  The worst thing about this episode is it will fuel
   even more "kill Lisa" posts [in alt.tv.simpsons --hmw] ... As much as I like
   Lisa, I have to say if Lisa was like this all the time, I think I would
   agree with them.

Yours truly: An interesting plot with many funny moments. Bart was marvelous,
   while Lisa was very annoying. It's good to see old traditions return such
   as Itchy and Scratchy and Bart skateboarding. (Grade: B+)

>> An education in TV

Benjamin Robinson shares some information that relates to the episode:
   Recently, the FCC has stipulated that TV stations air three hours of
   educational children's programming per week, or face the possibility that
   their licenses won't be renewed.  Problem is, children historically have
   ran away from "good for you" programming like it was cod liver oil, so few
   suitable programs existed.  Station managers, seeing that the rule wasn't
   going to go away, tried to justify some of the programming they already
   had as being educational.  They went to amusing extremes.  One manager
   tried to palm off "The Jetsons" as being worthwhile academic fare teaching
   children what life in the future might be like.  The FCC rebuffed that
   line of argument, I think.  On the other hand, they did accept one
   manager's claim that "The Animaniacs!" qualified as an educational
   program, because the characters occasionally burst into song about
   subjects like world geography.


>> We now break from this commercial, to bring you a show

Benjamin Robinson explains a joke from the episode: Once upon a time, a
   cartoon would air, become popular, and then spawn licensed merchandise.
   It was the natural order of things.  In the Eighties, toy makers reversed
   this process:  The merchandise would come out first, followed by a
   cartoon that would hopefully sell the new toys to the kids.  Events
   proved this to be a successful strategy.  The "He-Man" show, for example,
   moved millions of dollars of "He-Man" action figures, accessories, and
   clothing.  Of course, it also meant that broadcasters who aired the show
   (it was syndicated) were in effect paying to give the toy company free
   advertising.  On top of that, the resulting shows were often long on
   hardware and bad guys -- each of which had a real-life counterpart for
   you to buy -- and short on imaginative scripts and animation quality.
   None of these facts sat well with children's television activists, who
   threatened to take the matter up with Congress.  I don't think it got
   that far, but eventually the activists got their wish:  There are fewer
   "programercials" out now than there were before and, in my area at
   least, they get dumped in such prestigious time slots as 6:00am weekday
   mornings.


>> Lisa's characterization

   Matt Rose: This wasn't Lisa Simpson; this was someone who acted
   cold-hearted, egoistic, and downright selfish. 

   Tom Rinschler: So Lisa, who is attempting to be professional, is supposed
   to sweetly sit back and allow her undeserving brother to get the credit?
   She's supposed to not make a fuss when her brother is being superficial and
   getting praise for it?  She would have to out-Christian Flanders to "turn
   the other cheek" in such a manner.

   I think that Lisa's character is completely misunderstood by 90% of the
   people on this newsgroup [alt.tv.simpsons --hmw].  Half of these simply sum
   up there feelings with "Kill Lisa", while the other half of these put her
   so much on a pedestal as to nearly worship her as a goddess.  Lisa is the
   best character on the Simpsons because she is the most HUMAN.  She is at
   times sweet, at times angry.  She is adult, yet vulnerable.  She expresses
   great joy in life, yet great sadness.  Jealousy towards her more popular
   brother is certainly understandable.  And I don't think it's odd when ever
   the main support of her self-esteem (good grades) is attacked, she exhibits
   mental instability ("The PTA Disbands", "The Joy of Sect").

   IMHO, he behavior tonight fit perfectly within her characterization, getting
   more and more annoyed as her hard work went unnoticed and unpraised, while
   her brother's shallow work got all the credit.  I certainly would have been
   angry at Bart if I had been in her place.

   Matt Rose: Now that I've seen the episode again I can see where you're
   coming from, but to me it seemed a little overdone I guess... I don't know.
   To me when watching this it almost seemed like they were trying to portray
   those feelings as "evil", and that's what I really have the problem with...

   I'm also worried that enough people will probably read the episode the wrong
   way and feel even more compelled to spew out their anti-Lisa dogma.

   Ondre Lombard: Lines need to be drawn.  I won't dispute that a believable
   helping of humility on the part of Lisa would be welcome (heck, her petty
   and selfish side was well developed in "Lisa's Rival"), but here, she's
   wrapped up in her own little world, and most important, acting as though
   she's superior to Bart. And instead of trying to help Bart be a better
   journalist, she just wants to obsessively prove that Bart is actually
   unprofessional. (Am I the only person who noticed Lisa acting exactly
   like Frank Grimes did in "Homer's Enemy?" Right down to the maniacal
   laughter at the end of act two over the conception of a devious plan to
   make a fool out of another.)

   "I certainly would have been angry at Bart if I had been in her place."
   Angry, yes.  Obsessive?  Probably not.  Lisa really isn't a brat, despite
   being human.  The point I stress is that the writers went overboard with
   this genuine human quality, and turned her into a petty, bitter person.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

- MPAA rating: TV-PG {je}

- Benjamin Robinson: Assume each new "The Krusty the Klown Show" gets a new
  "Itchy & Scratchy" cartoon.  If Krusty doesn't have a summer repeat season
  (and I don't think the kiddie clown shows he's modeled on did), then he has
  aired I&S for 21 years.  On the other hand, if he produces only 26 weeks of
  new shows (and repeats each show once), then I&S has been a Krusty feature
  for 42 years.  I&S have been around even longer than that, so I'll guess
  they were popular in theaters before Krusty licensed them for his show.

- Benjamin Robinson's mini car watch:  Bart hides in a junked WV Beetle.  (The
  classic Beetle, not the new one!)

- A little explanation for people who didn't get the joke when Bart said "Some
  say the ducks went to Canada. Others say Toronto." Toronto is in Canada.

- Matt Groening has pet ducks and sometimes mentions them in his "Life In Hell"
  cartoon. {hl}

- It was odd to see Wendell on the merry go round given his history. {th}

- It is interesting to note that mouse pads were rather unknown 198 episodes
  ago. {th}

- Ondre Lombard: Krusty's show is flying farther and farther away from the
  realm of actual children's entertainment with every episode.  Paul Harvey?
  Monologues? Three hour and ten minute installments?  With hope these lines
  will be cut out of syndication so Krusty can still at least slightly
  resemble a children's show.

- David B.: That satire of TV news was SO dead-on it should be shown in
  journalism schools.  I went to one of those schools, and the emphasis in
  the broadcast classes was TOTALLY on "humanization" of stories.  The way
  they took a story and "humanized" it all out of its original form was
  absolutely hilarious. And that's what many of the best broadcast journalism
  students are being taught to do in college.  I wouldn't believe it if I
  hadn't gone through it.  The thing I notice about the Simpsons is the
  ACCURACY of their satires. Most of us probably don't even GET most of the
  jokes in the show, I'll bet, because we're not familiar enough with the
  subjects being lampooned.  But when you get a subject you know, like in my
  case, broadcast news, you realize how on-target they are with every little
  detail.  If they had lampooned something else... even if i had a passing
  knowledge of the subject... I wouldn't have appreciated it nearly as much
  as I did.

- Jordan Eisenberg's alterna-title for this episode is "Suppressing Your
  Anchor".

- Haynes Lee's alterna-title for this episode is "The Bongo Show".


>> Where is Springfield?

Tony Hill does the dirty work this time: The Union Pacific operates in these
   states: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas,
   Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma,
   Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.  And with its
   acquisition of the Chicago & Northwestern, you can add Minnesota, South
   Dakota, and Wisconsin.  Do you think I have too much spare time?


>> Meta references

- Krusty comments that "Itchy & Scratchy's" quality hasn't gone down in 5,500
  episodes.  Meanwhile, "Simpsons" fans debate if their show's quality has
  declined in the span of 200 episodes. {bjr}


>> Musical references

- "Scotland the Brave" on Willy's radio. {tr}
- "Turn, Turn, Turn" by the Byrds, played as Kent Brockman rides the Merry
  Go Round.

% Krusty, with the TV station lady first seen in "The Itchy and Scratchy

% cigar.

Krusty: [laughs] Man, you think the quality would dip after fifty-five
        hundred shows!  But... [laughs]
  Lady: Well, the FCC isn't laughing.  They don't believe kids are learning
        anything from Itchy and Scratchy.
Krusty: Oh, please!  What don't they learn?  Don't trust mice, cats
        are made of glass...
  Lady: Our renewal license is on the bubble.  We need educational 
        programming, fast!
Krusty: What about that Mattel and Mars Bar Quick-Energy Choc-O-Bot Hour?
  Lady: That's barely legal as it is.  Here's what I was thinking: a
        newscast for kids.  By kids.
Krusty: Well, you're not taking any time out of my show.  It's 
        jammed up as it is.  There's a monologue, those idiot puppets,

% Lisa begins to laugh evilly, when Mojo, perched atop Lisa's shelves,
% imitates her cackling.  She sees him, screams, and runs out the door.

% End of act two.  Time: 16:03.

% Act three.  Lisa enters Bart's dressing room, carrying an envelope.

Lisa: Hey!  Here's another letter for "Bart's People"!
Bart: Oh!  So many souls, so little air time.
-- "Girly Edition"

% Bart runs the envelope through an electric letter opener, and reads the
% note inside.

Bart: [reading] "Dear Bart, I came to this country hoping to share the 
      American dream.  But after many years of backbreaking labor, I find
      myself homeless and sleeping in a junkyard."
Lisa: [faking concern] Oh, how terrible-read-on.
Bart: [reading] "Should I abandon hope or fight on bravely against 
      impossible odds?"  Oh, this is too perfect.
Lisa: It is, isn't it?
Bart: I'm gonna put him on the air tonight, live!
Lisa: Oh, Bart, you'll have to ride your bike pretty fast to get out there
      in time.
Bart: No, I'll just take the chopper. [runs outside]
Lisa: They gave you a chopper?!
-- "Girly Edition"

% Homer and his helper monkey are on the floor of the living room.  Garbage
% is strewn everywhere, and the walls are splattered with goo.

% Marge complains that Mojo's wearing a diaper -- he's ment to be housebroken.
% Homer and Mojo say "eh," at the same time, tossing their hands in the air
% as if to say "who cares?".

Marge: [groans in frustration] You said this monkey would be sweeping 
       the floors and cleaning the gutters.  And now, he just lies there,
       struggling to breathe!
Homer: What do you want?  His cholesterol's through the roof.
Marge: I want you to take that monkey back, so he can be rehabilitated and
       get a second chance.
Homer: No, no, he's fine!  Go on, Mojo!  Show Marge your happy dance!
-- "Girly Edition"

% Mojo gets up, and stumbles across the floor, barely able to breathe.  He
% makes it to a wall and leans against it for support, exhausted.
% Homer: "And, so on."

% Later, Homer leaves Mojo at the door of the Animal Assistants Program.
% He steps on the gas and speeds away from the scene.
% Man: "Mojo!  What have they done to you?"

% Punching a few keys into a voice generation typewriter, Mojo tells 
% him, "PRAY FOR MOJO".  Back at the Channel Six TV Station, Milhouse does
% a news report on a topic of great importance to him.

So, by waking up a little early and having some extra sheets 
handy, no one's the wiser.  Tomorrow, "Destroying The Evidence".
-- Milhouse's news report, "Girly Edition"

% Bart begins his report on the letter he received.

% Suddenly, a familiar face emerges from under the rubbish, his clothes
% torn, his body broken.
% Bart tries to talk himself out of trouble.
% Willy lunges at Bart with a yell and the fender of a car in hand.  
% Lisa, watching this from the newsroom, begins to laugh.  However, when 
% Willy declares intentions of murder and knocks the camera over, killing 
% the live transmission, she reconsiders.

% Lisa: "Oh no, what have I done?  Nelson, cover for me!"
% Lisa rushes off, and Nelson sits in the anchor's chair.  Staring at 
% the camera, he clears his throat, and begins making armpit fart noises.  
% Switching to camera two to Nelson's left, he turns to face it, and 
% continues.

% Meanwhile, in the city dump, Willy walks around, searching for Bart.
% Willy imitates the voice of a cop, saying they caught Willy.
% Bart comes out from his hiding place, under the hood of an abandoned
% car.
% Bart sees Willy and screams.  He ducks back under the hood, and Willy,
% bumper in hand, prepares to do away with him.  He bangs away at the hood
% several times in anger, when Lisa pulls up on her bike.

  Lisa: Willy, stop!
Willy: Get away with ya!  I've gotta finish him off, while I'm still
        temporarily insane!
-- "Girly Edition"

% Drastic action is needed, so Lisa puts herself in front of the hood.

  Lisa: No, you can't hurt Bart!  He's... well... he's your son!
Willy: What?!
  Lisa: Well, not literally.  But, in a way...isn't he everyone's son?
        For you see, that little hellraiser is the spawn of every shrieking
        commercial, every brain-rotting soda pop, every teacher who cares
        less about young minds than about cashing their big, fat paychecks.
        No, Bart's not to blame.  You can't create a monster, and then whine
        when he stomps on a few buildings!  I'm Lisa Simpson.
        [Willy sniffles, then drops the fender.]
Willy: You're right.  It's all Willy's fault!  I've been a terrible 
        father!
-- "Girly Edition"

        Bart: [emerging] Hey Lis', thanks.
        Lisa: Boy, that phony schmaltz of yours sure is powerful stuff!
        Bart: Uh, yeah, but I have a certain respect for that whole truth
              and hard work thing that you do.
        Lisa: You know, Bart, if we combine your showmanship with my
              integrity, we could make kids really care about the news.
        Bart: You're right!  If we work together, there's no stopping us
              [The pair shake hands.  Later, we see the result.]
TV Announcer: The new, improved Kidz Newz...has been canceled!  Stay tuned
              for the Mattel and Mars Bar Quick Energy Choc-O-Bot Hour!
-- Okay, nothing but Choc-O-Bots can stop us, "Girly Edition"

% The program begins.  The Choc-O-Bots are at their command center.

Choc-O-Bot: You can count on us, Mr. President.  Major Nougat!  Gooey!
            Cocoa!  Put down those entertaining Mattel products!  Colonel
            Kataffy is up to his old tricks!
     Cocoa: Let's power up!

% Bart and Lisa watch the show on TV from their living room.

Lisa: I can't believe they canceled us for this s...
Bart: [interrupting] Shut up!  I'm trying to watch this!
-- "Girly Edition"

% At the cry of "Chocolate Away!", the Choc-O-Bots soar out through their
% ceiling and into space, accompanied by the sounds of a squealing electric 
% guitar, and of course, the credits.

% End of act three.  Time: 21:28.
