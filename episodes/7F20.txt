===============================================================================
   ... the banner `Eat Drink and Be Merry' at the party?
   ... Marge wears lozenge-shaped earrings?
   ... Mrs. Flanders' name is Maude?  And Mrs. Lovejoy's name is Helen?
   ... the car parked on the Simpsons front lawn at the party?
   ... Barney had zipped his fly up on his shirt tail? [Justin Masters]
       He also did this in `Principal Charming'.  {jpc}
   ... when Homer drunkenly tells off one of the guests, the hors
       d'oeuvres platter still reads, ``Boy, our party sucks''.
       (Apparently, Marge's cooking skills need honing.)
   ... Homer slept on the cat?  (When he gets up the next morning, a
       very frightened Snowball II scurries away.)
   ... the music Marge uses to drown out her argument with Homer is the
       same music that the doctor used in `Simpson and Delilah' to drown
       out his conversation with Homer?
   ... when Homer was explaining to Bart why he acted the way he did
       the previous night, there is a model of the Road-Runner on Bart's
       dressing table? {cjb}
   ... Marge's hat she wore in church, precariously balanced atop her
       impressive coiffure?
   ... Maggie was tossing things into the shopping cart?  (Compare 7f13.)
   ... that Marge was losing her voice as she neared the end of her list
       of Homer's shortcomings? {dwt}
   ... the oil spot is back in the driveway when Homer and Marge come home?
   ... Maggie fell only once?  (When Marge notes how wonderful the
       house looks.)

Ron Carter {rc}:

   ... Adolf Hitler looking disapprovingly at Homie in church?
   ... Enjoy More Worms Today?
   ... Leaches $.50?  Yeah, some fishers really do use leeches to fish.
       And the sign was indeed spelled, `leaches'.
   ... the Sew and Sew store in (lovely) downtown Springfield?

[Sanders Bayne (sanders.bayne@canrem.uucp) notes]

   ... Ned stuffs the whole bottle of alchohol into Homer's glass?
   ... Dr. Hibert's wife looks like Claire on the Cosby Show?
   ... Behind Rev. Lovejoy during the trust excercise, there was a picture of
       a person who seemed lost?
   ... one of the baby twins in church had a bowl on her head during the party?

Dave Hall {dh}:
At the party...
   ... Possible Maggie fall-down: Maggie sort of hangs on to the edge of the
       table, waves her little hand and either falls, or lets go.
   ... Ned was wearing a pink shirt and tie under his sweater?  (That
       free-thinking anarchist!)
   ... there was a car parked on the front lawn near the windows?  (How did
       it get there?)
   ... Rev. Lovejoy and his wife was at the party?  Homer had the lampshade
       on, jumps on top of the couch, fell over, spilling Rev. Lovejoy's
       drink on himself.  (Note that the spilt drink is actually an animation
       goof as it was drawn in after Lovejoy dropped his glass.)
   ... when Marge throws the coats on the bed, there appears to be what looks
       like a rather tall wig on top of the dresser?
   ... at the end of the party, Dr. Hibert actually helps his wife over Homer?

After the party...
   ... in Homer's flash back, his 2 strands of hair were styled back in the
       form of a wave?  Slick!
   ... in the babysitter's flashback, there's only a tiny spot of oil in the
       driveway?
   ... when Homer & Marge drive away, Marge's head (including her hair) is
       sticking out the car door window.
   ... the wide shot of the resort shows 5 cars parked?  If there were three
       couples and the Lovejoys, that would still leave one car not accounted
       for.  Did one of the couples drive to the retreat in different cars?
   ... when you see the three couples for the first time, each couple's
       spouse is sitting apart?
   ... there appears to be a spot of oil under one of the school buses?
       (As seen while Bart is talking to Auto.)
   ... according to the line marks, the Convict, with a rather large earring,
       has been in prison for 30 days, or 2 1/2 years, depending on what
       each line meant?
   ... the pay(?) phone outside the cell of the convict?  (Kind of hard, if
       not impossible, for him to make calls.)

===============================================================================
> Animation Goofs
===============================================================================
Sanders Bayne observes that Homer rows back with both paddles in good condition
even though he broke one on General Sherman's head.

Dave Hall reports:

Before getting maced, Barny is holding his mug in his left hand.
Afterwards, the mug is shown in his right hand.

Bart, Lisa, & Maggie are looking out the window at the station-wagon.
This scene is somewhat impossible as the front bay windows are not
parallel to the driveway.  Another "possible" goof is the station wagon
parked facing the street.  The night before, Homer's car appears to be
the only car in the driveway. (But, there was a station-wagon parked on
the street.)

In the Baby Sitter's flash back, the movement of the position indicator
does not match the movement of the handle when "Baby Bart" puts the car in
drive.

Chris Baird notes:

When Maggie was trying to climb onto the table, the colour of the `Maggie
Baggie' was blue, but afterwards when the parents run out of the Dining
room in a panic, Maggie's overall has turned pink.

===============================================================================
> Homer's recollection of the party
===============================================================================
Dave Kessler, via Ben Morss (morss@husc.harvard.edu):

The part where Homer is imagining himself being very erudite and witty at
his party is straight out of something called `The Algonquin Round Table',
or something like that.  It might also have had to do with Virginia Woolf.
He says that there is no question about it, that the reference was very
blatant.

billl@june.cs.washington.edu (William Longabaugh):

This scene has previously been called a reference to Abe Hirshfeld's
drawings, but I don't think that's right.  Both times I've watched the
scene I also thought it was a reference to the Algonquin Round Table.  I
don't know much about it, but it was part of the 1930-40's (?) social
scene in New York City; the Algonquin is a hotel near Times Square.  I
stayed there once with my parents years ago and I remember drawings of the
Round Table in the lobby that looked just like the stuff in the Simpson's
scene.  I think the drawings are pretty well-known, thus the reference in
the show.  While the style is similar to Hirshfeld's, I think the Round
Table stuff predates him.

wab@worf.Rational.COM (Bill Baker):

The Algonquin round table was not a book or a movie; it was a famous group
of writers who used to meet at the Algonquin Hotel and exchange witty
repartee.  Supposedly, most of those Dorothy Parker quotes people are
always attributing to other people were originally exchanged as bon mots at
the round table.  I think maybe W.S. Merwin and Moss Hart were part of the
circle, but I'm not sure.  At any rate, it was a very `New Yorker' clan,
and as is noted in the summary the cartoon style of that sequence is
reminiscent of Hirschfeld or `New Yorker' covers.

merlyn@digibd.com (Merlyn LeRoy):

No one had yet brought the Hirschfeld & Algonquin threads together yet,
so I will.  Hirschfeld has <drawn> Algonquin get-togethers (he's older than
dirt); I remember one of Harpo playing golf on the table, with Dorothy
Parker, George S. Kaufmann, et al.  He was probably considered a fringe
Algonquin.

Marge: That was our wedding!
Homer: Oh.
-- pre-party discussion, ``War of the Simpsons''

% Marge sends the kids to bed, though Lisa wants to hear the witty banter
% of sophisticated adults, and Bart complains, ``You can't have any
% fun in bed.''  Homer chuckles, ``When you're older, you'll know better'',
% and thinks of eating a hoagie in bed.   The doorbell rings.

Homer: Yeah, how do I look?

[looks at the living room; nothing spectacular]  Whatever!
-- Ned tries to compliment the Simpsons, ``War of the Simpsons''

% Ned mixes a drink...

Homer: Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it!
Ned:   Au contraire, Simpson.  It has three shots of rum, a jigger of
       bourbon, and just a little daberilla of creme de cassis for flavor.
Homer: Really?  Well, I do have a warm sense of well-being, and I sheem
       to be slurring my speech.  You're right!  Gimme another.
-- Flanders demonstrates his mixological skills, ``War of the Simpsons''

Is that a new kind of mace?  It's really painful.
-- Barney talks to Patty (or is it Selma?), ``War of the Simpsons''

% `horse doovers'', and Homer asks him to do ``that thing you know how
% to do'' for the adults.  Bart doesn't know what he's talking about,
% so Homer sends him to bed.  Later that evening, Homer makes a fool of
% himself with a lampshade on his head.  Meanwhile, Maggie gets into
% the pile of coats and makes confetti of the dollar bills.  Homer drunkenly
% tells off a guest, and looks down Maude's dress.  The guests leave...

Dr. Hibert:  If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you
    roll him onto his stomach.
Marge: Thank you, I will, Dr. Hibert.  Thanks for coming.
Dr. Hibert:  Remember, I said `if'.
-- The party's over, ``War of the Simpsons''

Lisa: That music always sends a chill down my spine.
-- The kids watch Marge and Homer talk in the car, ``War of the Simpsons''

% Marge asks Homer if he remembers how he acted at the party, and Homer's
% recollection is most flattering to himself, then his memory kicks in,
% and he realizes what really happened.

I like to think that I am a patient, tolerant woman, and that there
was no line you could cross that would make me stop loving you.
But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!
-- Marge, ``War of the Simpsons''

% Marge says she's going to church alone.

Marge: You are going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred
       him for life.
Homer: No, I didn't!  I ... Oh, you mean inside, don't you.
-- ``War of the Simpsons''

% Homer talks to Bart.

Homer: About last night.  You might have noticed Daddy acting a little
       strange and you probably don't understand why.
Bart:  I understand why.  You were wasted.
-- Damage control, ``War of the Simpsons''

Homer: I'm sorry it happened, and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect
       for me.
Bart:  Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will.
Homer: Awww.... [pats Bart's head]
-- Damage control, ``War of the Simpsons''

% In church...

We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack, including

Grampa: I can dress myself.
-- Asking Grampa to babysit the kids, ``War of the Simpsons''

% Grampa the list of emergency numbers, then goes to the kids and
% hugs Bart (``Nga!''), Lisa (``Mmm...'') and Maggie (``suck, suck, suck'')
% farewell.  She pulls a slip of paper out of her hair.  ``Call this number
% if Grampa falls in the bathtub''.  (``I heard that!'')

Bart:   Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this.

Bart: After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty
      Burger, and head for the arcade.
Lisa: Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man.  He trusts us.  Are you sure it's
      right to take advantage of him?

      wrong?  But right now, my gut's telling me, ``Bleed Gramps dry.''

Homer: [mutters] Oh.  Lucky they don't keep guns in the house.
-- At Rev. Lovejoy's marriage encounter retreat, ``War of the Simpsons''

Rev.:  Come on, Homer, what are her faults?
Homer: Well, sometimes it can be annoying.
-- At Rev. Lovejoy's marriage encounter retreat, ``War of the Simpsons''

-- Marriage counseling retreat, ``War of the Simpsons''

Marge, as a trained marriage counselor, this is the first instance where

Otto: Any chicks over eight?
Bart: Not yet, but the afternoon is young.

Bart: Lisa, what's wrong?
Lisa: Isn't it obvious?  We've degraded ourselves and set back the children's
      rights movement for decades to come.
Bart: You're great at a party, Lis.  Really great.
-- Lisa observes the wild party Bart is throwing, ``War of the Simpsons''

% Grampa tries to control the situation, with absolutely no success.
% Homer finally subdues General Sherman.  Bart wishes the partygoers

I gave up fame and breakfast for our marriage.
-- Homer, after tossing `General Sherman' back into the lake,
   ``War of the Simpsons''

% The two are reconciled.  Bart and Lisa furiously clean up the house

% secret is pretending to cry, and gloats, ``I can turn it on like
% a faucet.''

I'll never trust another old person...
-- Bart realizes Grampa duped him, ``War of the Simpsons''

% At the bait shop...

Clerk: Yep, `General Sherman'.  They say he's five hundred pounds of
       bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know.  No one knows how old he is, but
       if you ask me (and most people do), he's hundred years if he's a day.
Customer: And uh no one's ever caught him?
Clerk: Well, one fella came close.  Went by the name of Homer.  Seven feet
       tall he was, with arms like tree trunks.  His eyes were like steel,
       cold, hard. Had a shock of hair, red like the fires of Hell.
