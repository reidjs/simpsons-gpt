==============================================================================
   (Canada)  There's no life like it when Lisa joins an all-boy military
   academy and gets the sound off from all the male cadets, including Bart.
   Her will to succeed is tested when she faces a grueling physical test known
   as The Eliminator. Willem Dafoe provides a guest voice.

   ... they don't go to "Painless Dentistry" (like they did in 9F15) any more?

Jeremy Gallen:
   ... the General thinks Bart can handle a large weapon because he went to
       [public] school, but doesn't think Lisa can, even though she goes to
       [public] school?  [{ljg} notes, "She's a girl."]
   ... Lisa says "My God" before she says "I'm delirious", like people in
       previous episodes have done?

       Australia?
   ... fellow cadets are like boys from Shelbyville?

   ... the joint taped to the hippie's mouth?
   ... the banana peel in the "comm room" garbage can?
   ... the octopus' eyeballs are in the same place as Frink's after it wraps
       itself around Frink's head?
   ... the Eliminator rope was made of hemp?  [Partly.  It was hemp-jute --
       Ed.]
   ... none of the cadets sitting *behind* Lisa in the cafeteria threw
       meatballs at her?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... in the very last scene, there's a white 1970 Mercury Cougar in the

=  In "The Moon of Earth", the flag behind Adlai Stevenson has 44 stars, not
   48 (as there were in the flag at the end).  {ddg}

=  While Chief Wiggum is inside talking to Homer, he's also in one of the
   police cars chasing Bart in the lawn mower.  {ddg}

*  Why didn't any of Bart's classmates hear him playing with the megaphones?
   {el}

+  Since when do the Simpsons have a riding mower?  [Possibly since "Lisa the
   Vegetarian (3F03)," but most people thought that was an error, as well --
   Ed.]  {ddg}  [{ljg} suggests he may have "borrowed" it from a neighbor --
   Ed.]

*  Why would Lisa expect SES to teach her about poetry?  We didn't get to that
   stuff until Junior High.  {jg}

=  In the wide-angle shots, the phone has only nine buttons instead of the
   normal twelve; also, Grampa's rotary phone has only eight slots instead of
   ten.  {jh}

=  The Commandant's insignia is much more visible in the latter parts of the
   show than in the earlier ones.  {ddg}

=  Homer throws one rock, but more than one kid moves.  {mg}

=  The Simpsons first drive to the academy in Homer's Pink car and drive away
   in the orange station wagon.  [This might not be an error.  See "Comments"
   section for more -- Ed.]  {dm}

*  Lisa's "classmates" seem far older than second grade.  {el}

*  Bart's rocket launcher is incredibly powerful if it flew all the way to
   Springfield.  And how did he aim it so well as to hit Skinner's car?  {el}

*  Gauge is a measure of thickness.  The eliminator rope was 60 gauge, which
   would be extremely thin.  As a reference, most stereo speaker wire is 14-18
   gauge.  [More, "Comments" section -- Ed.]  {djp}

=  Lisa's harness doesn't appear until after she starts falling.  {ddg}

=  When Lisa gets to the platform on top of the "Eliminator," she backs up
   against the pole and looks down.  The screen shot shows her feet hanging in
   mid-air!  {pu}

*  Does this mean Lisa is going to continue her education in military school?
   (We'll never know, as we'll never see Lisa in third grade...)  {ddg}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Well, it wasn't "Summer of 4 Ft. 2", but at least it was
   better than I had feared it would be.  Lisa's military-school travails were
   well set-up, although the plot never really went anywhere.  Still, as
   always, plenty of funny moments: Bart's havoc with a bullhorn was the
   highlight of the show. I just wish it had a more satisfying climax.  (B)

Joseph J. Barder:  A better episode than either "My Sister, My Sitter" or "The
   Old Man and the Lisa," because Lisa actually ends up succeeding.  However,
   while Bart starts out back in old form, he loses all of it when he goes to
   military school.  He should have secretly humiliated the school, not
   conform to this pack of thugs.  (B+)

Vince Chan:  Another season finale has come upon the show.  How many more lie
   ahead, on the road to the series finale?  This episode was overall good.
   The first act was chock filled with great memorable moments and quotes.  It
   was so predictable, when Lisa was climbing on the Eliminator, that she
   would make it to the other side.  Now if it was Homer ... Great finale
   overall.  It's a season finale to remember.  (B+)

Don Del Grande:  This episode had too many things I've seen too many times
   beforehand (Lisa treated as an outcast; Grampa going on and on; Homer just
   lying there; Marge's speeches) without too many things that were worth
   laughing at.  (B-)

Masarath Ghiasuddin:  Finally!  After a really shaky season, we get
   quintessential Simpsons: the exploits of Bart and Lisa, with the other
   characters used mainly for laughs.  It was a nice change to see Bart being
   nice.  I was ROFL at "We better go change!"  (A)

Jason Hancock:  An average ending to an average season.  I was glad that Lisa
   didn't turn into a PC thug like I had feared, but the story was still a
   little weak especially since the basic premises (Bart being punished, Lisa
   being neglected) have been done better in other episodes.  (C+)

Ryan Johnson:  VERY, VERY disappointing.  It's amazing how far a show can fall
   in one season.  The episode was so bad, I really must wonder why anyone
   bothered to make it.  Seeing Bart spun on a propeller and Lisa firing a
   machine gun really made me feel like I was watching a show that just
   happened to contain characters from the Simpsons.  Where's the realism?
   The relevancy?  Gone.  (F)

Ondre Lombard:  Bart goes through too many character changes in this story,
   which starts out painfully slow.  And Lisa going to military school just to
   avoid the monotony of school and read poetry is just a bit drastic for me.
   Bart should've stuck up for Lisa during the chant for her to fail at the
   Eliminator.  I'm also disappointed at the lifted emotion in some of the
   scenes.  A weak season finale.  But I'm just glad they didn't try to make a
   PC statement with the story, since it was so easy.  (D)

Bill Pentney:  The Simpson writers are running out of plot ideas, but the show
   hasn't lost it.  This wasn't the best I've seen ("The Springfield Files",
   which followed it tonight, was better) but it had its moments, like the
   film about the moon.  "Couldn't we be doing something more stimulating,
   Miss Hoover?"  "Eh, probably."  (B)

Matt Rose:  I liked this one so much I watched it three more times!  This one
   had everything - it made me laugh hysterically and I enjoyed the bonding
   between Lisa and Bart. I got that same good feeling from episodes like
   "Lisa's Wedding" and "Lisa on Ice".  And I always enjoy anything with
   Professor Frink.  A great rip on the military institutions of our country.
   Definitely one of this season's best, and deserving of its position as the
   season finale.  It really is great to see that after so many years, they've
   still got it.  I only wonder what the final season (maybe) has to offer.
   (A)

Donni Saphire-Bernstein:  This was a solid, hilarious expansion into territory
   that's always been in the back of every Simpsons episode- what if Bart got
   into SERIOUS trouble and couldn't weasel out of it?  The episode then read
   like a semi-serious topic, but studded throughout with hilarious asides and
   observations.  I enjoyed it very much.  Unlike the past two episodes
   (Homer's Enemy and Spinoffs), this was a straightforward Simpsons episode
   and played like one.  [...]  The whole little thingamajig with filmstrips,
   the running gag of Bart and police cars, Wiggum's incompetence- all further
   proof of how this show stays head and shoulders above everything else.  (A)

Rock Shum:  This was a great ending for a great season!  This is the second
   year in a row that they ended with a very touching and funny Lisa episode.
   I thought this was gonna be a Shannon Faulkner-Citadel type thing when I
   heard about the plot, but Lisa proves to girls and woman that their is
   place for them in the military.  While Lisa wasn't up to it physically, she
   sure deserved the equal rights to attend the academically superior military
   school.  It was touching to see Bart come out in cheer for Lisa to cross
   the big ditch.  [...] Bart-Lisa episodes are always good, and I hope to see
   more.  (A)

Marge Starbrod-Simpson:  Bad jokes, bad storyline, stupid ending, 'nuff said.
   Thank God for the repeat of 3G01 afterwards!  However, this is only number
   five on my worst episode list.  (D-)

Aaron Varhola:  A very good season finale; Lisa and Bart were well within
   character, and it was good to see how they both developed away from the
   stultifying experience of Springfield Elementary.  Bart was particularly
   multifaceted; he was able to prove himself as a cadet, while also
   encouraging Lisa to succeed.  Good and well-timed gags, as well.  The only
   drawbacks were a moment of [crud] at the end, and the unrealism of weapons
   use among the cadets.  (A)

Yours Truly:  This season's wrap-up tale is a surprisingly serious test of
   Lisa's character.  An excellent script by Richard Appel avoids falling into
   the snare of having Lisa climb onto her soapbox.  Apart from the first act,
   this episode wasn't really a laugh riot, and Lisa's suffering may turn some
   viewers off.  Still, stories like this demonstrate why "The Simpsons" is no
   ordinary sitcom.  (A-)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B (2.94)   Std Dev.: 1.1987   (22 reviews computed)

   (Available on video)


>> Writer Watch

Dale G. Abersold:  Richard Appel has been one of the more successful writers
   to join the series in the last few years.  His first efforts were the
   almost universally beloved "Mother Simpson" [3F06] and "Bart on the Road"
   [3F17]. This season's "Bart After Dark" was less popular with a.t.s
   critics, but was still liked by many.


>> He probably should have stuck with more "Simpsons" episodes

Dale G. Abersold fills us in on Mr. Dafoe's background:  Willem Dafoe has had
   what can only be described as a "varied" career. After gaining fame with
   the Chicago-based Steppenwolf acting troupe, he made his film debut as an
   extra in "Heaven's Gate."  He has appeared in films that are good
   ("Platoon" and "The English Patient"), bad ("Body of Evidence"),
   controversial ("The Last Temptation of Christ" and "Mississippi Burning"),
   and weird ("Faraway, So Close!").  His next role is as the villain in "The
   Bus That Couldn't Slow Down 2".  Er, I mean, "Speed 2".


>> Y'know, most guys =like= it when girls come to campus.

Benjamin Robinson:  Lisa's travails at Rommelwood are obviously based on
   Shannon Faulkner's miss-adventures at The Citadel.  For over a century, the
   Citadel was a military academy-type college in South Carolina.
   Traditionally, it was an all-male institution; no women need apply. And,
   I'll bet, few women wanted to apply.  Ms. Faulkner decided to buck the
   trend, however.  She submitted an application that omitted all mention of
   her gender, and was accepted.  When she told the Citadel, in effect, "I
   obviously made the cut, so you should let me in," the school refused.  The
   matter ended up in the courts system, which decided that since the Citadel
   received funds from the federal government, it was bound by federal non-
   discrimination rules.  The Citadel was faced with two choices:  go private
   (since privately-funded rules could be one-sex-only), or admit Ms. Faulkner
   into their Corps of Cadets program  (she had been attending as a day
   student while the courts pondered their ruling).  The former clearly wasn't
   feasible, and the Citadel, for the first time in its history, admitted a
   young woman.  Feminists everywhere declared a great victory, while students
   at the college prepared to make her life there a living hell.

   The story didn't end there, however.  Another Citadel tradition holds that
   new students must get their heads shaved as part of a school initiation.
   Ms. Faulkner tried to get out of this, which poked a hole in her previous
   argument that she should be treated like any other cadet.  Her older
   argument held sway, however, and she joined the other shaven-headed "knobs"
   on campus.  Alas, it was all for naught; the school's rigorous physical
   initiation proved to much for her, as it did for many male students before
   her, and she dropped out.  Since then, a few other female students
   attempted to break the gender barrier at the Citadel; they met the same
   fate as Shannon Faulkner. Only time will tell if the Citadel will yield to
   change and become a co-ed school, or if tradition will ultimately hold
   sway.


>> Classroom Cinema

Bill Pentney remembers:  Outdated or bizarre movies seem to be a staple of any
   public school education.  When I was in third grade (in the mid-1980's!), I
   really saw a filmstrip like the one Lisa saw about the moon in class -
   although Adlai Stevenson made no appearance, there were references to
   "someday Americans will walk on the moon" and such.  I also recall one
   which involved a girl dreaming about a world without rules, and before she
   wakes up we hear her going "Rules ... Rules ... come back" or something
   like that, not unlike the "Zinc ... Zinc ..." in episode 8F16.


Darrel Jones points out that the film wasn't completely without educational
   value:  The Earth/Moon Weight conversion chart in the filmstrip appears to
   suggest a weight of 180 pounds on the Earth is equivalent to a weight of 30
   pounds on the moon.  The correct ratio is 6:1, so the filmstrip has this
   detail correct (and probably ONLY this detail... :) )


Claus Rasmussen:  The gravity on Earth is about 9.81 m/s/s at equator (and
   9.816 m/s/s in Denmark, it gets stronger the closer you get to the core of
   the Earth). On the Moon the gravity is ca. 1.63 m/s/s, which gives an
   Earth/Moon ratio of 6:1. This, however, doesn't influent the actual mass of
   a given item. 100 kg will still weigh 100 kg no matter if it's on Earth or
   on the Moon. The only thing that changes is the force needed to lift the
   100 kg (981 N on Earth/163 N on the Moon).


>> Over 100 billion sold

Benjamin Robinson:  Not to trod on Haynes Lee's territory, but I think I
   spotted an urban legend when Chief Wiggum pointed out the "California
   Cheeseburger." According to legend, a couple leave their infant child in
   the care of a teen-aged babysitter and enjoy a night on the town.  When
   they return, the obviously stoned babysitter reports that the baby is fine,
   and the turkey is in the oven.  "What turkey?" the parents ask themselves -
   - until the horrible truth about what's <really> cooking hits them...

   There are several variations on this story, but thankfully none of them
   have proven true.  Still, that does not seem to have stopped Chief Wiggum
   from using the notion of edible babies to scare the kiddies straight.


>> Oh, =that= Rommel

Benjamin Robinson:  Rommelwood named for this World War II German general.  He
   is most known for fighting in the North African theater of operations.
   Later, he would come to disagree with Hitler's twisted goals, and joined a
   conspiracy to kill him.  This would, I suppose, make him one of the less
   objectionable Nazis.


Danny Sichel corrects:  Erwin Rommel wasn't a Nazi, which is why the Nazis had
   him assassinated.  [I heard they had him commit "suicide" -- Ed.]


>> And hey, the make topping lawn ornaments, too!

Aaron Varhola:  The Terra Cotta Warriors of Xi'an (Sian) are approximately
   6000 life-size, uniquely sculpted soldiers found in the tomb of Emperor
   Shih Huang Ti, of the Ch'in dynasty, who ruled until his death in 210 B.C.
   They are regarded as one of the greatest examples of ancient art.  (Some of
   the figures were exhibited in Portland this past summer at the "Tombs of
   Ancient China" exhibit at the Portland Art Museum).


Benjamin Robinson adds:  The amazing thing is, whoever made the statues didn't
   just make a mold and pop out [6,000] copies.  Each statue has a different
   face and is a unique as you or I. Some small groups of the statues have
   been removed from their tomb, and the public may now look at them in
   museums around the world.


>> The amazing changing car

When the Simpsons dropped Bart off at the school, they appeared to arrive at
   school in Homer's sedan, and leave in Marge's.  Bob Beecher explains this
   apparent inconsistency:  My take on it is that it is a "smash time cut".
   After all, they must have had to go back home to get Lisa's stuff; and the
   kids are wearing their "blues", so it must've been a time cut to make the
   "I heard you the first time" joke (?) work.


>> She may be crazy and alone, but what great poetry!

Aaron Varhola's poetry corner:  Emily Dickinson (1830-1886) was a poet best
   known for her reclusiveness; she withdrew from the world in her late 20's,
   and did little except for household chores and writing for the rest of her
   life.  A commentator said that her isolation helped her focus on her
   writing by keeping a distance from the world.  Only six or seven of her
   poems were actually published during her lifetime, and those without her
   permission.  A sample of her work, which might apply to Lisa in this
   episode

   Aspiration

   We never know how high we are
   Till we are called to rise;
   And then, if we are true to plan,
   Our statures touch the skies.
   The heroism we recite
   Would be a daily thing,
   Did not ourselves the cubits warp
   For fear to be king.

   --- from Erin's Emily Dickinson Page,
   <http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/3607/emily.htm>


>> Gauging the thickness of that rope...

Oliver Thomas:  The measurement of shotgun shells (gauge) has its roots in
   times when materials were very rare. The caliber is the number of shells
   you could produce out of one old English pound of lead (correct word? chem.
   Pb)!  [Yes, that's the word -- Ed.] So the greater the number, the smaller
   the diameter.  The average shotgun shell is 12. Had to learn it for a
   German weapons license some time ago.


>> The State of Simpsonity

Joseph J. Barder observes:  Either Lisa and Bart are dumber than we thought,
   or Springfield's either in California or a state nearby.  Otherwise, why
   would they believe they're going to Disneyland by car, on a trip that
   apparently is as long as a trip to the dentist?  (They're not very
   observant in the car, either.)

==============================================================================
> Quotes and Scene Summary  {bjr}
==============================================================================
% Oh, boy!  It's time for a fourth-grade field trip and this time, Bart
% gets to go someplace more exciting than the box factory -- the police
% station.  Or at least, it would be more exciting if the station were
% actually open.  Right now, though, the doors are securely locked as
% Ms. Krabappel and her class wait on the front steps.
%
% With sirens wailing, Chief Wiggum pulls up in front of the children,
% hitting the curb.

Boy, it's getting harder and harder to make it here by ten.
-- Chief Wiggum with the early-morning blues, "The Secret War of Lisa
   Simpson"

% Wiggum gets the police station key from under the doormat, unlocks
% the door, and lets everyone inside.

Wiggum:   We'll start the tour in a second.  I just gotta check the
          answering machine.
          [does so; there are 75 messages]
          Aw, can't anybody in this town take the law into their own
          hands?  [deletes the messages]
-- If you want it done right ... "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% The first stop on the tour is the museum ... of crime.

Wiggum:   Now, what I am about to show you next may shock and educate
          you.  Hold onto your values as we step through the looking
          glass into a hippie pot party.
          [flicks a switch, lighting a mannequin with a joint crudely
          stuck to his mouth]
          While Johnny Welfare plays acid rock on a stolen guitar, his
          old lady has a better idea.
          [lights up another mannequin, of a woman opening wide to eat
          a baby sandwich.  (That's a sandwich with a baby in it, not a
          really tiny sandwich.)  The crowd gasps]
          That's right, she's got the munchies for a California
          Cheeseburger.
-- Would you like fries with that?  "TSW"

% Back at Springfield Elementary, Lisa's class finishes watching a
% movie about sand.

So the next time you're walking on the beach, enjoying an hourglass, or
making cheap, low-grade windshields, think where we'd be without sand!
-- "Sand" movie narrator, "TSW"

% Without much enthusiasm, Miss Hoover loads the next movie onto the
% projector.  Lisa asks if the class could be doing something more
% challenging.  "Probably," Miss Hover says with even less enthusiasm,
% and rolls the next film, "The Moon of Earth."

Narrator:  The moon.  For several years, she has fascinated many.  But
           will man ever walk on her fertile surface?
           [cut to a shot of Adlai Stevenson at some sort of press
           conference]
           Democratic hopeful Adlai Stevenson says so.
Stevenson: I have no objection to man walking on the moon.
           [photographers snap several pictures]
           [cut back to the moon where a family plays on the moon's
           fertile surface]
Narrator:  By 1964, experts say man will have established twelve
           colonies on the moon, ideal for family vacations.
           [a man fishes a comely moon maiden out of a crater.  She
           winks at the audience]
           [a chart shows the difference]
           Once there, you'll weigh only a small percentage of what
           you weigh on Earth.
           [cut to a shot of a chubby boy eating pie]
           Slow down, tubby!  You're not on the moon yet!
           [cut to a shot of the moon, with an American flag
           superimposed on it.  The camera pulls back to reveal some
           men in spacesuits]
           The moon belongs to America, and anxiously awaits the
           arrival of our astro-men.  Will you be among them?
           [fini.  The film runs off the reel]
Ralph:     Miss Hoover, the movie's over.
Lisa:      Where's Miss Hoover?
Janey:     [looks out the window] Hey, her car's gone.
Ralph:     Maybe she drove to the moon.
-- "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% Lisa talks to Principal Skinner with the hope of making Miss Hoover's
% class more academically rigorous.

Lisa:     It's not my nature to complain, but so far today we've had
          three movies, two filmstrips, and an hour and a half of
          magazine time.  I just don't feel challenged.
Skinner:  Of course we could make things more challenging, Lisa, but
          then the stupider students would be in here complaining,
          furrowing their brows in a vain attempt to understand the
          situation.
-- Damned if you do, and damned if you don't, "The Secret War of Lisa
   Simpson"

% Meanwhile, the fourth graders' tour of the police station takes them
% to the communications room (or "comm room").  Wiggum shows the
% children the police radio, which serves as both a communication
% device, and a handy surface for banana stickers.  Wiggum then leads
% the class into the next room, where he'll sit down and rest for a few
% minutes.
%
% Bart lingers behind.  He chances upon a wall of bullhorns, takes one
% down, and tries it out.  He takes a second one down, puts it up to the
% speaker of the first one, and tries again.  Sure enough, it's a
% noticeably louder.  Then he looks at the bullhorns on the wall, and
% the pair in his hand, and then back at the wall five times, and gets
% an idea.
%
% Bart lines them up, with one end of the row propped up on the
% windowsill, and the other on a chair.  He turns them on.  A fly buzzes
% past the microphone on the first horn, and the amplified buzzing
% shakes the whole row.  Now it's Bart's turn; he's excited, because if
% one bullhorn makes your voice loud, then an entire row must do
% something really spectacular.  Bart leans toward the row of horns, and
% says, "Testing."
%
% The results are spectacular indeed!  The noise from Bart's "Testing"
% blasts him into the opposite wall of the comm room.  Meanwhile a shock
% wave rips through the town, breaking windows and wreaking havoc.  The
% front window of a pet shop is broken, and all the parrots echo, "Awk!
% Testing!  Testing!"  Professor Frink is caught unawares when the sound
% wave detonates the aquarium of an octopus he's experimenting upon.
% Freed, the animal latches itself to his face.  The wave even reaches
% the Simpson home, shattering all of Homer's beer bottles.
%
% Later, Chief Wiggum and the Simpsons gather in the living room to
% talk about Bart's latest prank.  Or at least they try to, since the
% echo of the bullhorns can still drown out normal conversation.

Homer:    [yelling to be heard] You really did it this time, Bart!
          You're in for the punishment of a lifetime!
Lisa:     When do you expect the ringing will stop?
Wiggum:   In about ten to fifteen seconds.
Marge:    I certainly hope [the ringing stops] so.  [realizes she's
          still yelling]  Ooh!  [puts her hand to her mouth]
          That's better.
          [Maggie removes to pacifiers she had been using as earplugs]
          Now about your punishment, young man.
Bart:     [gets up] I know, I'll go to my room to think about what I
          did.
Homer:    Oh, no, your room is full of toys.  You're going to the, uh,
          garage.
Bart:     [leaves]  You're the boss.
Marge:    I tell you, Chief, I just don't know what we're going to do
          with him.
Wiggum:   You know, you do have options.
          [Bart rides by the living room window on a lawn mower]
          For example, there are behavior-modifying drugs.  How wedded
          are you to the Bart you know?
Homer:    Not very.
Marge:    No-o-o!  No drugs!  Bart just needs a little discipline.
Wiggum:   Uh, hey, what about military school?  It set my brother
          straight.  Now he owns and operates a famous cave.
Marge:    You know, maybe Chief Wiggum is right.  Military school is a
          good idea.
          [The family looks out the front window.  Bart rides by in the
          opposite direction, followed by police cars with their lights
          flashing]
-- "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% The next day, Bart goes for a ride with the family.  Thinking he's
% going to Disneyland, he throws his suitcase into the trunk, and gets
% in the car.  Then it hits him -- nobody else has brought along =their=
% luggage.  Homer hits the gas before Bart can make his escape.  The car
% roars off, revealing Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel camped out
% on lawn chairs across the street.

Krabappel: [simultaneous with Skinner] Yay!
Skinner:   Hooray!
Krabappel: You dream about this day for so long, then when it comes,
           you don't know what to say.
Skinner:   Edna, your tears say more than words ever could.  [the two
           clink champagne glasses]
-- When dreams come true, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% Bart protests the change in itinerary.

Bart:     Military school?!  You lied to me!
Homer:    [chuckles] Well, I'm sorry if you heard, "Disneyland," but I
          distinctly said, "military school."
-- Blasted homonyms, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% The car pulls up the long drive to Rommelwood Military Academy.
% While the family tours the facility, the camp Commandant pitches
% Rommelwood as a place where Bart can be molded onto a productive
% citizen through "an intensive program of push-ups and formation
% marching."

Marge:      Well, it certainly was nice of you to accept Bart in the
            middle of a semester.
Commandant: Fortunately, we've had a couple of recent freak-outs, so
            that freed up a couple of bunks.
Bart:       Freak-outs?
Homer:      If, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire
            semester?
-- "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% Continuing their tour of the school ground, the Commandant points out
% a row of cadets standing at attention.  Lisa admires their discipline;
% Homer tests it by throwing a rock at them.
%
% The family and the Commandant peek into a classroom.

Cadet:    Truth is beauty, beauty truth, sir!
Lisa:     They're discussing poetry!  Oh, they never do that at my
          school.
Teacher:  But the truth can be harsh and disturbing!  How can that be
          considered beautiful?
Marge:    Well, they sure sucked the fun out of that poem.
-- Imagine what they'd do to "The Waste Land", "The Secret War of Lisa
   Simpson"

% Bart tries a last-ditch effort at a reprieve, literally clinging to
% his father's leg.

Bart:     Please don't make me stay, dad.  I'll do anything you say.
          I'll find religion!  I'll be good sometimes!
Homer:    Let go my leg.
Bart:     No!
Homer:    Son, for the last time, you're staying at military school.
Lisa:     And so am I.
          [everyone else gasps]
          This school has everything I ever wanted.
Marge:    Lisa, no!  This place is just a jail for children.
Bart:     No jail can hold me.

          later]
-- Nice move, Houdini, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% [End of Act One.  Time:  7:47]
%
% The Commandant tries to make sense of Lisa's announcement.  It's an
% uphill battle.

Commandant: Let's go over this one more time, just to make sure I
            understand the situation.  [clears throat] You're a girl.
Lisa:       Yes.
Commandant: Oh, gosh darn it, I just don't understand the situation.
            [clears throat again] You're a girl?
Lisa:       All I want is the chance to prove myself.
Commandant: Hmm.  In our 185 years, we have never had a female cadet.
            But that seems to be the way the wind is blowing these
            days.  After all, we have female singers, female motorists
            ... Welcome aboard.
-- He's a progressive guy, all right, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% Marge gives Lisa the opportunity to opt out.

Marge:    Lisa, if you ever want to quit and come home, I'll be here in
          half a jiff.
Bart:     [poking his head into frame] I want to quit and come home.
          [cut to shot of family getting into car]

% With their parents gone, Bart and Lisa begin to settle in to their
% new environment.  The commandant introduces the kids to their barrack-
% mates.

Commandant:   Atten-hut!  Gentlemen, we now have a girl cadet among our
              ranks, so we're going to have to make a few changes.
              First of all, Franklin, you are no longer the girliest
              cadet here.
Franklin:     [effeminate] Well, we'll see about that.
Commandant:   Second, this is now the girls' barracks, so pack your
              things, you're moving in with Company L.
Cadet Leader: Company L?  But they smell!
Commandant:   [quietly] Yes, we've all head the chant.  [authoritative]
              Now, fall out!
Lisa:         [to cadets, as they file out the door]  Sorry ... sorry
              ... I know we'll be friends ... Talk about getting off on
              the wrong foot.  [laughs weakly]
-- Winning friends and influencing people, "The Secret War of Lisa

% The displaced cadets grumble about their new classmate.  Their leader
% [who, alas, remains nameless throughout the show] reminds them they
% can drive her out with the time-honored tradition of hazing.
%
% The next rainy night, Bart and Lisa are forced to do a little
% calisthenics.

Leader:    What's the matter?  Don't girls like doing push-ups in the
           mud?
Lisa:      Is there any answer that I can give that won't result in
           more push-ups?
Cadet #2:  [consults with platoon] No.
Lisa:      [collapses into the mud]
-- A no-win situation, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% No course of hazing would be complete without the traditional
% cleaning of a large object with a tiny brush.  In this case, Bart and
% Lisa are consigned to clean the grounds' signature statue of a general
% on horseback.  Cleaning graffiti goes against Bart's nature, and he
% doubts if he'll survive his stay at Rommelwood.  Lisa encourages him,
% saying that if he sticks with it, the other cadets will accept him.
% The cadet leader interrupts their gab session.  "Get to work," he
% yells.  "I want to see my face in that horse's ass!"
%
% Next, the cadets gather in front of a prop plane, idling its engines
% on the tarmac.   "Okay, that's long enough," their leader decides.
% Someone kills the engines, and we see that Bart and Lisa are strapped
% to the propeller blades.  The crowd decides that Bart has passed their
% test of mettle, and carries him off on their shoulders.  Lisa, on the
% other hand, is left strapped upside-down to the propeller.
%
% But military school isn't all fun and hazing.  It's time for weapons
% class on the firing range.

Rangemaster: Well, since you attended public school I'm going to assume
             that you're already proficient with small arms, so we'll
             start you off with something a little more advanced.
             [hands Bart a fearsome-looking grenade launcher]
Bart:        [impressed] Whoa!
             [Bart shoots at the targets downrange, and hits four of
             them.  His fifth projectile goes sailing off in the
             distance, however]
Rangemaster: Four out of five, Simpson; impressive.  But you missed
             your last target.
Bart:        Did I?
             [cut to Springfield Elementary parking lot.  Skinner

Nelson:      [from school window] Ha, ha!
-- Explain THAT to your insurance agent, "The Secret War of Lisa

% The cadet leader is impressed with Bart's marksmanship, as well.
% Lisa doesn't seem to be the natural that Bart is.  She somehow gets
% her rifle stuck on "auto-fire," and the recoil literally lifts her
% several feet in the air.  The Rangemaster comes to her rescue.

Maybe you should just learn to use this.  [hands Lisa a whistle] If
there's a war, just blow on it, and I'll come help you.
-- Rangemaster at military school, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% That night, Lisa makes a phones home.  "I am just calling home," she
% reassures herself, "I am not asking to =come= home."  That's a good
% thing, because Homer isn't in the position to answer the phone.
% (After all, that would involve sitting up.)  So, Lisa tries her luck
% with Grampa.

Nurse:    [answers phone] Simpson.
Grampa:   Hot diggity!  I don't care if it's bad news!
Lisa:     Oh, Grampa!  You're not busy, are you?
Grampa:   Well, you're really asking two questions there.  The first
          one takes me back to 1934.  Admiral Byrd had just reached the
          pole, only hours ahead of the Three Stooges ...
          [later]
          ... and I guess he won the argument, but I walked away with
          the turnips.  The following morning, I resigned my commission
          in the Coast Guard.  The next thing I heard, there was civil
          war in Spain ...
          [much later]
          ... and, that's everything that happened in my life right up
          to the time I got this phone call.
Lisa:     Uh huh.  So, anything else you want to talk about?
Grampa:   I'm afraid I'd just be repeating myself, honey.  Uh, anyway,
          other people need to use the phone.  [holds up receiver]
Jasper:   Uh, uh.  I've already talked to her twenty damn minutes.
-- Reach out and touch someone, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% Dejected, Lisa hangs up.  On her way out, she notices some mail from
% home in her pigeonhole.  She takes it over to Bart's barrack and
% knocks on the door.  The commotion inside immediately dies down, and
% Bart answers the door.

Bart:     What is it?
Lisa:     Bart, I got a cassette from Mom and Dad.  I thought we could
          listen to it together.
Bart:     Gee, Lis, I'd love to, but this really isn't a good time.
Leader:   [from inside barrack] Bart!  Who are you talking to?
Bart:     Uh ...
Lisa:     Lisa!  You're talking to Lisa.
Bart:     I'm talking to ... no one.  [closes door]
-- Ouch, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% The Commandant orders lights out for the night, but when he tries to
% leave the barrack in the dark he slams into something.  He orders
% lights on just long enough to limp to the door, then it's lights out
% again.
%
% Alone in the darkness of her barrack, Lisa listens to the cassette
% from home.

Marge:    [on cassette] Don't worry, sweetie.  It's very common to be
          homesick when you're so far away from the people who love
          you.
Lisa:     [pauses tape] Okay, I'm not going to give up.  Solitude never
          hurt anyone.  Emily Dickinson lived alone, and she wrote some
          of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known ...
          then went crazy as a loon.
          [forward the tape a bit, and then resumes playing]
Marge:    [singing] You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me

          I love you; so don't take my sunshine away.

% The next day, Bart tries to make amends with Lisa.

Bart:     Sorry I froze you out Lis, I, I just didn't want the guys to
          think I'd gone soft on the girl issue.
Lisa:     [sighs] I'm tired of being an issue, Bart.  Maybe everyone
          would be better off if I just quit.
Bart:     But if you quit, it'd be like an expert knot tier quitting a
          knot-tying contest right in the middle of tying a knot.
Lisa:     Why'd you say that?
Bart:     I dunno, I was just looking at my shoelaces.  But the point
          is, you're going to make it Lis, and I'm going to stick by
          you.
Lisa:     Don't do that.  Why should we both be outcasts?
Bart:     Then I'll just stick by you in secret.  Like a sock maker
          secretly working on a top secret sock that ...
Lisa:     [interrupts] Will you stop looking at your feet?

% Later, the Commandant calls an assembly.

Commandant: Well, cadets, it's been a great year.  You've all worked
            very hard developing academic skills and general killing
            skills.
Bart:       [aside to Lisa] My killing teacher says I'm a natural.
Commandant: But these skills are nothing without courage and stamina.
            Traditionally, the academy tested these virtues by pitting
            you against each other in a two-day battle royale.
            [the cadets gasp]
            That was prior to 1957, thank you very much state Supreme
            Court.  Consequently now, no cadet can receive a passing
            grade for the academic year without first conquering this:
            [gestures to a field overgrown with thorny bushes.  At
            either end of the field are two platforms mounted on high
            poles.  A rope is strung between each platform]

            crawl across a sixty-gauge hemp-jute line with a blister
            factor of twelve.  The rope is suspended a full forty feet
            over a solid British acre of old-growth Connecticut Valley
            thorn bushes.
            [turns to cadets]
            Gentlemen, welcome to flavor country.
Lisa:       This wasn't in the brochure.
-- And you thought finals were tough, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% At lunch, Lisa eats at a table by herself in the crowded cafeteria.
% Bart passes her, and slips her a note.

Lisa:     [reading] Meet me at the Eliminator after lights out.  P.S.,
          The cadets are planning to throw their meatballs at you.
          Ohhh ... [holds her tray up just in time to deflect a
          fusillade of meatballs]
-- "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% At the Eliminator, Lisa gets in some secret practice and tries to
% crawl along the rope.  Despite Bart's encouragement, she slips off the
% line and falls toward the thorn bushes.  Fortunately, a rope harness
% breaks her fall, and Bart swings her over some softer ground by a
% tree.

Lisa:     I can't do this, Bart.  I'm not strong enough.
Bart:     I thought you came here looking for a challenge.
Lisa:     Duh!  A challenge I could do!
-- Getting more than she bargained for, "The Secret War of Lisa
   Simpson"

% Bart hears the voices of his cadet-mates drawing closer.  Hurriedly,
% he hauls Lisa up by the rope into the tree.  The cadets and Bart
% question each other about their activities, and agree to let each
% other's alibi (nothing) pass.  After they leave, Bart sighs with
% relief.  Lisa isn't as relaxed, because Bart has inadvertently hauled
% her up next to a beehive.  Started by the bees, Bart lets go of the
% rope and Lisa lands with a thud.
%
% It's Eliminator Day.  The Commandant announces another policy change.

Commandant: Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that the state Supreme
            Court has determined that forcing cadets to cross the
            Eliminator is a barbaric and malicious practice.
Lisa:       Yes!
Commandant: Hence, you will be the last class to be subjected to it.
-- Don't get your hopes up too soon, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% The Commandant begins subjecting students, in alphabetical order.  As
% the day wears on, Bart gets his turn, and makes it across with some
% grumbling.

Good job, Simpson, although that's more cursing than I like to hear
from a cadet in peacetime.
-- Military school Commandant, "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% Lisa's turn.

Commandant: Next up ... Simp-son, Lis-a.
            [the crowd falls silent.  The cadet leader plays, "Taps."
            Lisa climbs the ladder to the first platform, as the crowd
            begins jeering]
Lisa:       Well, at least they're talking to me.
            [at the top of the platform, she looks at the ground, which
            appears to be 400 feet below her, rather than 40.
            Tentatively, she grasps the rope and starts to cross in
            hand-over-hand fashion]
            If only I were in Springfield, all my friends would be
            cheering me on ... oh, God, I'm delirious.
            [Lisa's hands slip, and she dangles from the rope by only
            her legs]
Cadets:     Drop!  Drop!  Drop!  ...
Bart:       [steps forward from the crowd] You can make it, Lisa.  I
            know you can!  Come on, I know you can do it!  Just get
            your hands back on the rope!  Just a little further!  [Lisa
            grabs the rope again and begins crawling] Come on, a little
            bit more, you're doing great!  That's it, come on, just a
            little bit more!
            [the other cadets try to silence Bart, but he wriggles free
            of them]
            I know you can do it, I believe in you!
            [and she does it!]
Lisa:       Yes!  [she gets to the next platform, and climbs back down
            to earth]
            [arms raised] You said I couldn't but I could I did and I
            could do it again let's do it again!
Bart:       Lisa, it's over, you made it.  You can put your arms down.
Lisa:       I can't, they're stuck.
-- Winning ... "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% Not everyone is happy with Lisa's triumph.

Cadet #2:  We're going to make your life a living hell for the rest of
           the semester.
Leader:    But, graduation's in three hours.
Anderson:  We'd better go change!
-- "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% The Commandant addresses the graduating class.

The wars of the future will not be fought on the battlefield or at sea.
They will be fought in space, or possibly on top of a very tall
mountain.  In either case, most of the actual fighting will be done by
small robots.  And as you go forth today remember always your duty is
clear:  To build and maintain those robots.  Thank you.
-- Military school Commandant's graduation address, "The Secret War of
   Lisa Simpson"

% The crowd throws their hats into the air, and cheers.  Later, Homer
% and Marge collect their kids and get ready to return home.

Homer:    [nervously] Well, Bart, did you make sure to return all the
          guns?
Bart:     Sir!  Yes, Sir!  Luckily, I am now trained in six additional
          forms of unarmed combat, sir!
Marge:    Well, he seems to have gotten more confidence.
Homer:    Uh, yeah, I've always said that the boy could use more
          confidence.
-- "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"

% The Commandant awards her with a well-deserved medal, "For
% Satisfactory Completion of the Second Grade," and salutes her.  Lisa
% returns the salute, and admires the medal on the car ride home.  Homer
% cheerfully announces that since Marge and he are so proud of what they
% accomplished, he'll take them to Disneyland "for real."  The car pulls
% into the huge parking lot of ... the dentist.  D'oh!  Better luck next
% year, kids.
