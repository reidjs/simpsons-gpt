> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================

Steve Alpert:
   ... Maggie makes baby noises, which is rarer for her than saying a first
       word (she's up to 6 of those)?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Maggie applauds when the "Simpsontubbies" enter?
   ... the fingerprint card had eight spaces?
   ... if "trees died" to make the menus, at least they're biodegradable?
   ... the Luftwaffe had a slightly better record than the Washington
       Generals?  (Tell the ex-Soviets, or the French, otherwise)
   ... Lisa was "called" chicken by a turkey?
   ... Homer didn't say "why you little" before choking Bart?
   ... Lisa managed to wrap the rope around the branch three times in the time
       it took the Texan to say one line?

Ahmet Deligonul:
   ... the weather seems like summer or spring in this episode, yet the
       Simpsons have a fire in the fire place?
   ... the Texan grew out from the carnival business and now has a company?

Ben Fonter:
   ... that Maggie was clapping along with Marge's (bad) singing?
   ... Bart is reading issue #1 of "Itchy & Veronica"?

Joe Green:
   ... Bart's Teletubby antenna is shaped like a trident?
   ... the apartment complex Bart canvasses resembles the Watergate complex?
   ... the innuendo of Moe saying "I never said no to a dead girl"?
   ... the giant bong in front of Hemp City?

Darrel Jones:
   ... one of the Dirt First protestors looks like Kearney?
   ... Lisa can see the St. Louis Arch and the Statue of Liberty from the top
       of the tree?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the parents are dressed as the male Teletubbies, while the kids (except
       Maggie) are dressed as the females?
   ... the branch Lisa is sitting at is facing west (St. Louis Arch, Eiffel
       Tower, and Statue of Liberty in that order can be achieved that way)?
   ... Maggie is the only one awake when Lisa rushes back to the tree?
   ... the "In Memory of Lisa" screen on the Simpson's TV?
   ... the flag at Springfield Elementary is at half-staff (the sign of
       mourning)?

Andrew Levine:
   ... Bart's comment about Lisa "sitting in a tree," shortly before the tree
       even comes up for the first time?  (foreshadowing)

Ryan Mead:
   ... on the cover of "Itchy and Veronica," the title characters drink out of
       Archie's head?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Homer's Teletubby antenna mimics his hair strand?
   ... meanwhile, Lisa's antenna looks like a "female" symbol?
   ... Maggie claps along to Marge's song?
   ... Shelbyville is labeled in Lisa's tree-top view?
   ... even though we don't see her wearing it during her tree vigil, Lisa
       brought along one of her red dresses?
   ... the runaway log goes past a Red Blazer Realty branch?
   ... the dolphins jumping over the runaway log?

Jessy Scholl:
   ... if you look closely at Lisa's view from the tree, you will also notice
       the Hollywood sign?

c  Bart throws his game console into the fire, we hear, "I can still make you
   happy ... make you happy ... make you happy ..."  The Closed Captioning
   reads, "Store in a cool dry place ... cool dry place ... cool dry place
   ..."  {dh}

+  Bart says, "I don't have a cap."  Has Bart forgotten about his Lucky Red
   Cap?  {ml}

c  When Bart says, "moneys is funnies, sister," the CC reads, "I have to
   nourish the old noodle, Lisa."  {bjr}

*  Jessie is a teenager, but he says he was doing yoga before it was popular.
   Yoga became mainstream-fashionable in the 70's and early 80's, so Jesse's
   sense of pop-culture history is skewed, or he's lying.  {al}

c  When Homer does donuts in the car, we hear, "Mmmm, donuts."  The Closed
   Captioning reads, "Love is a battlefield."  {dh}

+  Jesse refers to the redwood as a sequoia in one scene.  {jg2}

c  Lisa says "Not so fast!" when the loggers approach the tree, but the CC
   reads, "Yoo-hoo!"  {bjr}

c  Kent Brockman calls Lisa a "crazy idiot."  The CC reads, "crazy, crazy
   idiot."  (Okay, that one's a nit-pick.)  {bjr}

=  When Lisa closes her eyes in Marge's arms, her mouth becomes much less dark
   for some reason (as if there was a skin-colored film over her mouth).

   taken out of it is there, though -- Ed.]  {bjr}

=  The split along the trunk appears to have moved between the time Lisa sees
   it, and the time it shows up on the news.  {bjr}

=  When Kent Brockman says that it isn't Mr. Burns who died, an image pops up
   -- a picture of CMB, with "not dead" underneath.  But if you notice, it's
   partly off screen, and then the "camera" pans a little bit until the
   picture is where it should be -- as if it materialized in the air behind
   Kent (for what sort of news broadcast thing would do that?).  {mg}

c  Someone yells that Jesse is cutting the "guy wires" (the correct term, by
   the way), but the CC reads, "tree supports."  {bjr}

=  When the "Lisa" log falls, the Lisa-head at the top should have been facing
   the ground, not outward.  {cl}

*  If the Dirt Firsters are against the destruction of forests, why didn't
   they complain when the runaway log obliterated the trees in its path?  {jc}

*  The tree falls into the Pacific Ocean.  (Golden Gate)  Therefore, it must
   be west of the Continental Divide to begin with.  Which directly
   contradicts the view from the tree.  {sa}

c  During the tree song at the end, we hear, "Now it's spreading love to you
   and me."  The Closed Captioning reads, "But now it plagues society."  {dh}

   but the closed captioning reads, "Crushing nice folks like you and me."

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Stephen Burks:  While this it did have a moment or two of laughter, this
   episode as a whole was terrible.  The ending especially left me with a bad
   taste in my mouth.  While there was actually a plot in the episode, it
   seemed more like a front for the writers to display their views on the
   modern environmental movement.  I am assuming that they really dislike
   proactive environmentalists (note: episode AABF09 Homer to the Max).  If
   this is what they consider social commentary, then I recommend that they
   just go back to weird wild wacky jerkass Homer.  [...] I was going to give
   this a C- until I saw the last minute.  The magic log bit was just too
   extreme/stupid/overbearing for me:  (D)

Don Del Grande:  This show had some laugh-out-loud moments in it, but there
   were too many holes to rate it anything near a "classic" episode -- for
   example, they never did do anything with the "Bart wants a new game system"
   subplot other than use it as an excuse to get to Krusty Burger.  And why go
   with "Lisa spends time with her family, only to return to the downed tree"?
   While Lisa leaving telegraphed the tree's destruction, a quicker turnaround
   would have been funnier. Maybe it is time that "The Simpsons are going to
   Paris" needs to be considered ...  (B+)

Joe Green:  This sounded like a "Lisa the PC Thug" episode from the beginning,
   but it was actually tolerable compared to others of its type.  The Bart
   subplot had its funny moments, but unfortunately it was never wrapped up.
   (What is it with these gratuitous, unresolved tangents in so many episodes,
   anyway?)  Sad to say, I've found Season 12 unimpressive so far.  (C)

Darrel Jones:  GREAT episode!  It's about time the show made fun of the
   environmental groups which can get just as obnoxious as the "let business
   do what it wants" anti-environmental groups.  The Bart opening, though
   similar to "Marge Be Not Proud," was original and hilarious enough to be
   funny.  The plot was well-done and not too contrived, and nearly all the
   jokes worked.  The "This Log is Your Log" number almost had me ROTFL!
   Altogether, a superb 9/10  (A)

Joe Klemm:  The first thought of this was going to be that Lisa was going to
   be too political for her own good, one thing that bugs me.  However, it
   turns out to be better than expected with a balanced storyline that is
   easily handled with three different acts with a different storyline (Bart
   becoming a flyer boy[something I can relate to]/Lisa meets activists, Lisa
   lives in a tree, Lisa is considered dead by most of Springfield).  The only
   thing that needs to be changed though is if they got rid of Marge's song
   about saving money.  (A)

Andrew Levine:  An episode that flags whenever the focus is on any Simpson but
   Lisa, CABF01 only underscores how jarring each respective Simpson becomes
   in the episodes where he or she is not at the center of attention.  The
   focus here is more on drama than on humor, and for the most part it's good
   drama.  It's a shame that nearly every joke deflates before the punchline
   is received.  The members of Dirt First! (the group's name is easily the
   funniest part of the episode) seem pretty on-key, even if their real-life
   counterparts are occasionally more militant.  (I personally can't wait to
   see how they respond to this episode.) In the end, the episode makes good
   on the essential message that Lisa is a little girl with sympathies for the
   environment, rather than a "hardcore" eco-revolutionary.  There's not much
   on it but that.  (B-)

Adam W. Long:  Matt Selman has never failed to impress me.  Even if the
   writing is done in a "group setting" these days, Selman's episodes still
   seem to stand about above the rest, and CABF01 is no exception.  Not once
   in this episode was I able to really complain, in fact, I found myself
   pleasantly surprised for most of it. The Simpsons were actually behaving
   like a *family*, the plot was reasonable, Homer was the lovable idiot we
   all used to know, and there was even somewhat of a sub-plot!  The
   characterization was on, and there was plenty of humor in it as well.
   Being the first "official" episode of Season 12, I'd say it's off to a
   great start!  (A)

Michael Nusair:  "Lisa the Treehugger" was probably one of the best episodes
   of recent memory.  It almost makes one forget about such duds as "Kill the
   Alligator and Run" and "Missionary: Impossible".  Almost.  It had excellent
   writing, good characterization, and plenty of laughs.  Homer was not a
   jerk, and he didn't get mortally wounded.  In fact, I don't think I have
   *any* serious complaints about this episode.  Sure, it wouldn't hold up if
   you compared it to an episode from the Simpsons' prime, but this late in
   the game ...  I really don't think it gets too much better than this, and I
   loved every second of it.  (A+)

Chris Palm:  Mike Scully must be dead.  That's the only reason I can come up
   to explain the continually rising quality of season 12.  For the second
   week in a row, we get an episode that feels like it was written back in
   season 6.  The only thing I can think of to bash in this ep was, well ...
   the animation.  Was it just me, or was Marge abnormally tall and skinny?
   Same with Homer.  His head should NOT be smaller than his bearded area.
   But ah well!  Plenty of hilarious lines that didn't feel insulting to my
   intelligence, an actual flowing plot, and great Lisa characterization.  Her
   best ep since 5F17.  (A)

Abhi Ray:  Basically, the writers had a whole lot of good ideas [...] and
   weren't able to construct it into a good story.  I liked Lisa's
   characterization throughout, the way she's more human than the radical
   environmentalists who she admires.  The jokes, while thin towards the
   middle, were pretty funny, such as Bart's martial arts techniques, the
   stockings/Easter joke, and Homer strangling Bart.  But more could have been
   done.  For example, Lisa's crush on Jesse seemed to exist merely to garner
   an "aww" reaction; it didn't really have any purpose.  Also, the family
   wasn't involved enough with their own daughter embarking on such a
   dangerous mission.  Finally, the ending, while it did have an amusing song,
   was manipulative, the way the log just destroyed Hemp City.  (C+)

Mike Reed:  Matt Selman pulls off another above average episode with "Lisa the
   Treehugger."  I didn't particularly care for the ninja-Bart thing at first,
   and at the end of the first act I became worried for the episode's quality.
   But, then the second act set things right with some great jokes, good
   characterization, and some actual emotion, which has been lacking in the
   Simpsons lately.  The 3rd act was okay, I was ROTFL when the Lisa-tree
   thing went rolling down the hill.  A little uneven maybe, but this is
   probably the best Lisa episode since [4F01] Lisa's Date With Density.  My
   second (A) in a row ... this season is looking up.  (A)

Jessy Scholl:  Another week, another winner.  It seems that the writers are
   turning out only good episodes these days.  Lisa the Treehugger is no
   exception.  I thought it was great.  From the beginning, with Bart's job,
   through the end with the Lisa tree fixture smashing into the select
   buildings before going out to sea.  If you missed tonight's episode, it is
   a must see in reruns.  I just can't see why anyone would not laugh at this
   episode. Especially near the end.  Grade:  (A+)

Robin Steinmann:  Definitely one of the best episodes in years.  It showed
   that they still can produce believable, coherent plotline, complete with
   emotional moments, three-dimensional characters (Jesse - partly activist,
   partly eco-snob), and hilarious comedy scenes (Chapeau to the Thai
   restaurant owner!).  Sadly, Homer didn't seem to belong into this story.
   They really have to work on him to make him part of a (partly) realistic
   Springfield universe again.  Still, after myriads of rather forgettable
   episodes, I dare to give it an  (A-)

Todd Willis:  All in all, this episode had a nice plot for a Lisa centered
   episode (we haven't had one of those in a while).  The first act had some
   funny moments, but seemed to be out of place within the rest of the
   episode.  The transition between Bart's job and the main plot wasn't smooth
   at all.  The second and third acts worked nicely within the story line, but
   didn't contain as many good laughs.  I also liked that the characters
   seemed like their old selves, instead of some of the wackiness of late.
   This episode had a nice, thoughtful story, but could have contained some
   better laughs.  (B+)

Yours Truly:  So far this season, it looks as though the writers are again
   going for the subtler and more rewarding humor that they used to in the
   recent past.  We're not seeing (as often) the unlikable characters and
   cavalier meanness that threatened to turn "The Simpsons" into a
   higher-class version of "The Family Guy."  Jesse Grass is well-realized,
   laughably self-righteous yet sincere enough in his beliefs that we
   understand why Lisa would have a crush on him.  Lisa's motivation to save
   the tree, part puppy-love and part activist, nicely blends the two sides of
   her personality.  It's a much nicer portrait than that of Lisa as the
   shrill force of good.  The ending was weird, but a cute song made it much
   more palatable.  In all, a well-balanced, likable episode.  (A-)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B+ (3.32)   Std Dev.: 0.8902   (22 reviews computed)

==============================================================================
>> Musical References

Andrew Levine:  "Spybreak" by Propellerheads (1997 recording) played while
   Bart hands out Thai menus, and also during the [end] credits.


Andrew Krupowski:  It was played during the memorable scene where Neo and
   Trinity shoot-up the lobby of the office tower where Morpheus is being held
   captive.

   It wasn't the movie's theme song [as the closed captioning said -- Ed.],
   but that scene was very well done, IMHO.


>> Meta-reference corner

Benjamin Robinson:  Marge says, "This family has had nothing but bad luck when
   it comes to farce."  'Nuff said.


>> Those never-ending threads

 - Where is Springfield?

Jessy Scholl:  Depends on where you think redwood trees grow.  Tonight's
   episode gives evidence that the Springfield is in either California or
   Virginia. Based on tonight's evidence, we can rule out Virginia as a
   location. This is because the view of Springfield when Lisa is in the tree
   is to be viewed as a joke.  Based on Info from "You Only Move Twice", and
   "Who Shot Mr. Burns" Part two, we can state that the Simpsons live in
   California


Steve Alpert replies:  But California is mentioned on a highway sign, which
   proves that it can't be there.  And the two-letter postal abbreviation is
   NT, so they live in the Northwest Territories.


So does Gerard Motola:  Uhh, no, they DON'T live in California in this
   episode. In the end, the log started went to Mt. Rushmore, then the Rocky
   Mountains, then San Francisco & Lombard Street then into the Pacific Ocean,
   which is going west.  So they live east of Mt. Rushmore if you believe that
   ...


Darrel Jones:  Springfield is near a redwood forest.  In the US, one only
   finds those on the Pacific Coast regions of Washington, Oregon, and
   northern California.

   Lisa can see St. Louis and New York City to the east.  The giant log, at
   the end of the ep, appears to have headed west through desert before
   reaching the Pacific Ocean at San Francisco (Lombard Street and the Golden
   Gate Bridge are quite visible).  So Springfield in apparently in the
   Midwest, probably Missouri or Kansas.


Steve Alpert rebuts:  It's not east.  If it were east, NY would appear in
   front of Paris - or actually not at all, since the three cities aren't in a
   straight line. She must be looking west, and she must be east of St. Louis.


>> Nerd alert!

Benjamin Robinson explores the frontier of nit-picking:  The numbering of the
   GameStation is a bit odd.  Normally the number refers to the generation of
   the unit (e.g. "PlayStation 2" is the second-generation PlayStation), or
   the bit-width of the processor (e.g. "Nintendo 64" uses a 64-bit
   processor).  Unless they started making GameStations in the Colonial era,
   we aren't on the 256th generation today.  On the other hand bit-widths
   normally comes in powers of two, so the expected predecessor to 256 (2^8)
   is 128 (2^7), not 252.  Yeah, yeah, it's just a cartoon ...


"The Webmiester" writes:  Don't forget that you can add processors to get a
   total, i.e. the Neo Geo is usually counted as a "24 bit" system because it
   has a 16-bit and additional 8-bit processor ... so --

   128-bit + 64-bit + 32-bit + 16-bit + 8-bit + 4-bit = 252-bit!  Now that's a
   lot of processors!


Tim Smith adds:  Bit-widths aren't always a power of two, though.  The Mattel
   Intellevision used a GI1600 processor, which was a mix of 10-bit and 16-
   bit.  The RAM was 16-bit, as was the registers, but the ROM was 10-bit, and
   the instructions were all 10-bit.  (10 bits were called a decle, and 5 bits
   were called a nickle).

Joe Green:  Lisa walks past a driveway containing an orange VW Beetle
   festooned with hanging Thai lunch menus.


>> At McDonalds, we love to see you clear-cut

Benjamin Robinson:  Reportedly, one of the reasons for the massive clear-
   cutting of South American rainforests is the need to create ranchland for
   cattle. Beef, of course, is a staple of the United States' fast-food diet
   so the thinking goes that as Big Mac consumption grows, the rain forests
   shrink.  In actuality, I don't think that McDonalds' is paying off the
   South American ranchers directly, but the export market is nevertheless a
   powerful incentive.  In fact, I once heard that a good percentage of the
   beef was going to the Japan, as that country picked up the American's taste
   for beef, but lacks the real estate necessary to support large-scale
   grazing.


Darrel Jones provides another perspective:  In the 1980's, a group of British
   vegetarians, in an attempt to get people to eat less meat, protested
   outside of McDonald's that the house that Ronald built did some pretty
   gruesome things.  Among others, they claimed McDonald's chopped down trees
   in the Brazilian rain forest to provide grazing land for their beef cows,
   like the Dirt First group on the show.  The heckling apparently hurt their
   sales so much, McD's sued the vegetarians for libel.  After a record-long
   trial that the British media gave the same treatment as American media gave
   the O. J. Simpson case, in the early 1990's the court ruled in McDonald's
   favor.


>> The original treehugger

Andrew Levine relates her remarkable story:  In 1997, a 1000-year-old redwood
   tree in Homboldt County, California, was slated to be hewn by Pacific
   Lumber, a logging company owned by Texas-based Maxxam Corporation.  On
   December 10 of that year, 25-year-old Julia "Butterfly" Hill of
   Fayetteville, Ark., a member of the environmental activist movement Earth
   First! and also co-founder of the Circle of Life Foundation, volunteered to
   climb 180 feet up into the tree, which she named Luna.

   Tree sitting is a common tactic used by Earth First! participants and other
   anti-logging activists, but few could have expected the astonishing
   resilience that Hill displayed.  Living on a platform constructed 180 feet
   off the ground, and communicating with the outside world through a cell
   phone and walkie-talkie, Hill endured threats from Pacific Lumber, which
   used floodlights and airhorns in attempts to extract her from the tree, as
   well as reportedly sending the police to disrupt Hill's associates on the
   ground, who supplied her with water and food.  Nevertheless, Hill claimed
   that she promised the tree its survival, and in December 1999, just over
   two years after Butterfly first ascended Luna, Pacific Lumber agreed to
   spare the historic redwood and a 20-foot buffer zone.

   Since leaving the tree, Julia Hill has published a coffee-table book, The
   Legacy of Luna, with all profits benefiting her Circle of Life Foundation,
   and continues to speak out for the security of the redwoods.  Hill's two-
   year-long-plus tree sit is listed by the Guinness Book as the longest such
   feat in U.S. history.  It's very easy to dismiss "Butterfly" as a
   treehugging kook -- she claimed that she communicated with Luna through the
   Universal Spirit -- but it's difficult to deny that her personal courage is
   staggering.

   [Michael Psycho reports that Luna was vandalized by person or persons
   unknown.  By coincidence, this happened a couple of weeks after this
   episode aired.]


>> "The Washington Generals of the History Channel"

Martin Langeveld:  The Luftwaffe bombers on the History Channel appear to be
   Stuka dive bombers.  These planes dove at a 90 degree angle, let their bomb
   go, and pulled up.  The bomb kept on going as the plane pulled up.  They
   were a great menace to troops retreating from France, but many of them were
   destroyed during the Battle of Britain.


>> "A" for effort

Benjamin Robinson:  Did you know that, in most universities, if your roommate
   dies, you get straight "A"s for that semester?  Of course you did; everyone
   knows that.  Unfortunately, everyone's wrong:  The story is just an urban
   legend.  Other variations on the theme require the roommate to commit
   suicide, not just die, or give you a refund on your dorm fee. You won't
   find any of these variations in any real college's regulations, though.
   It's probably just as well, since I can just picture some desperate student
   somewhere plotting to bump off his roomie ...

Speaking of snopes.com, Haynes Lee has this to add:  Snopes added the Simpsons
   reference to their site that same night so they follow the show too.


>> Fun with Promotions

Chris Palm:  Krusty's "We're not hurting Mother Earth ... we're just giving
   her a bikini wax." line, featured in commercials for this episode, wasn't
   actually in it. And rightfully so, considering he had nothing to do with
   cutting the trees down.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

According to Fox (by way of Bill LaRue), this episode scored a Nielsen rating
   of 8.5 (13 share).  This works out to 14.9 million viewers.  Among adults
   aged 18 to 49, the rating was 7.3 (17 share).

       to tear up my dad's tab and pour cocktail onions--  Dad, I can't!
Homer: [on tape:] Read it!
Lisa:  [on tape:] ... pour cocktail onions down your pants.
Moe:   Well, I ain't never said "no" to a dead girl yet.  [does the thing with
       the onions]
-- "Lisa the Tree Hugger"

% The town meets at the stump.  Mayor Quimby is about to have Branford
% Marcellus play Lisa's saxophone, but Milhouse runs up and yanks it, hoping
% to clone Lisa from the spit.

Quimby: And finally, an exciting announcement from our good friends at
        Omni-Pave.
Tex:    Folks, last night, the dear departed Lisa came to me in a dream.  She
        told me her fondest wish was that this forest would become the
        rootin'est, tootin'est, pollutin'est amusement park!
        [The curtains part, revealing the redwood log with a Lisa head on top
        and an electric sign that reads "Lisa Land"]
Jesse:  You promised us a nature preserve!
Tex:    Now don't you fret, we're sensitive to all your eco-concerns.
        [The two chainsaw men start their chainsaws]
        That's it, boys.  The gift shop will go right there.  Yee-haw!  Cut it
        down!  Ha ha!
Lisa:   Noooooo!
        [The crowd parts, revealing Lisa, who marches towards Tex]
CBG:    A g-g-g ... girl!
Lisa:   [on the stump] I'm not dead, and neither is my sense of moral outrage!
Homer:  Oh, here we go ....
Lisa:   [to Tex:] Sir, have you no shame?
Tex:    Clearly I don't.  [gestures to his car parked on a beaver's tail and
        bearing the license plate "NO SHAME"] Now get your heinie off of Lisa
        Land!
-- Lisa returns, "Lisa the Tree Hugger"

% Jesse complains about the use of a redwood for promotion, and cuts the
% guywires holding up the log, as Sideshow Mel observes. 
%
% The Lisa-headed log falls over and rolls down the hill, crashing through a
% pair of lumber trucks, to the joy of Dirt First.  Jesse compliments the
% tree, then orders it to return.  The Dirt First members are confused, and
% Jesse remembers he doesn't have superpowers ... yet.
%
% The log continues sliding, and goes into the business district.  It
% destroys the Omni-Pave building, to which Tex says "Gaahhh!"  Next, the log
% strikes Kentucky Fried Panda, which Homer laments, "It was finger-Ling-Ling
% good!"  The log doesn't stop yet, it demolished Hemp City, to the dismay of
% Dirt First.
%
% Lisa visits Jesse, who is back in jail.

Jesse: I'm still fighting for the earth.  I even got 'em to install a
       solar-powered electric chair.
Snake: [in the solar electric chair] Dude, we've been here all morning!  Could
       you at least remoisten my head sponge?
Lisa:  Well, I'll write you letters ... on rice paper ... with a soy pencil!
Jesse: Aw, you're sweet.  [kisses Lisa, who sighs] Did they ever stop that
       log?
Lisa:  Not yet.
Jesse: What's up with that?
-- "Lisa the Tree Hugger"

% The log continues sliding across the country: past Mt. Rushmore, through
% tornado-infested plains, racing against a train (the conductor waves to the
% log and blows the horn), and down the wavy part of San Francisco's Lombard
% Street, before heading into the ocean under the Golden Gate Bridge.

Singers: [to the tune of This Land]
         This log is your log.
         This log is my log.
         When lightening struck it,
         It kicked the bucket.
Moe:     I poured some onions
         Inside my trousers.
Singers: This log -- it used to be a tree.
         Now it spreads love to you and me.
         Hey, look, it's headed out to sea.
