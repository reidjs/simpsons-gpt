>> Homer's Car

From our resident revhead Noel Tomanick {nt}:
    The big news for this episode is I FINALLY KNOW WHAT HOMER'S CAR IS!!
    Since it has an 8-track player its obviously from the 70s, but the
    clincher was the airbag.  In the mid 1970s GM only installed them into a
    few of their cars to test their feasibility.  I've yet to verify it from
    a second source, but my guess as to what Homer's car is:

    --->  A 1975 Oldsmobile Delta 88

> Reviews and personal reactions
==============================================================================
Ron Hogan {rh}:  My favorite bit was when Scratchy crawls around the bridge
    on his bleeding kneecaps leaving a trail behind him.  God, I can't say
    how much I loved Steamboat Itchy.  It moved me.

J.D. Baldwin {jdb}:  It certainly was a thing of beauty.  But the great
    moment for me was the Scratchy-into-the-sawblade bit.  Itchy waving his
    hands, looking at his watch, then getting fed up and just hacking the
    cat to bits with an axe . . . well, my reaction to it was probably an
    insight into my own personality that's just too personal to share.

==============================================================================
> Comments, questions, and other observations
==============================================================================
For anyone who may not already be aware of the fact, the bulk of the animation
grunt-work for `The Simpsons' is contracted to Korean production companies
(Akom and Anavision).  Refer to Raymond Chen's capsule for ``Do the Bart,
Man!'' (available from the Widener archives) for the full story.

Jym Dyer {jd}:
    In last year's _Black_Widower_ episode, as they carted Sideshow Bob
    (a lifelong conservative Republican) away, he said:

        "You haven't seen the last of me!  You can't keep the
        Democrats out of the White House forever!  And when they
        get back in, I'll be back out on the streets . . . with
        *all* my criminal buddies!"

    As it happens, in [the 3-Nov-92] episode (in Pacific Time, this was
    right after Bush's concession speech), Maggie drove a car into the
    wall at Springfield Penitentiary, causing many criminals to escape.
    Mere Coincidence?

Rick Hann {rh2}; who openly admits to being a psych grad student:
    When Marge and Homer are driving to Parent/Teacher night, Marge can't
    hold the line with Homer (he gets his own way and gets to see Lisa's
    teacher, as he has every year).  Maybe the discipline problems with Bart
    start at a higher level in their own relationship.. :)

Tony Nowikowski {tn}:
    An excellent episode, but there were a couple of things that kinda
    bothered me..

    Mrs. Krabappel pulling out those *nasty* weapons ... it doesn't seem to
    be Bart's style.  Pranks like switching her birth control pills, or
    sending her love letters from "Woodrow", yeah, but weapons and violence?
    Those looked to be more Nelson's speed.

    Likewise, some of the nasty stuff Bart was doing at home seemed out of
    character.  Hammering packets of mustard or tearing up the carpeting for
    *no* good reason.  Bart is devious, sneaky, lazy and underhanded, but
    downright nihilistic?  Especially when the thing that cooks his goose is
    something as *in*-character as being inattentive to Maggie's whereabouts.

> Quotes and Scene summaries
==============================================================================
The entire family are watching a promo for the latest sequel in the
"Star Trek" (XII) saga; everyone is as old and out of condition in the movie
as you would expect them to be..

Kirk: Stardate 6051.  Had trouble sleeping last night.  My hiatus hernia
      is acting up.  The ship is drafty and damp.  I complain, but nobody
      listens.
Voiceover: Star Trek Twelve; So Very Tired.  See the original cast in their
       latest and greatest adventure!
Sulu:  Captain, Klingons off the starboard bow!
Kirk:  *Again* with the Klingons.  Mr. Scott, give me full power.
Scott: It's no good, Captain!  I canna reach the control panel!

Grampa: Movies!  What a ripoff!  I don't have to sit here and take this!
        I-- ZZzzzzz...

Homer and Marge make their way down the stairs to attend Parent-Teacher
night at Springfield Elementary.

Marge: We'll bring back dinner.
Lisa:  What are we going to have?
Homer: Well, that depends on what your teachers have to say.  If you've been
       good-- pizza.  If you've been bad uh, let's see... poison.
Lisa:  What if one of us has been good, and one of us has been bad?
Bart:  Poisoned pizza.
Homer: Oh, no.  I'm not makin' two stops.

Homer and Marge leave in the car.  They talk along the way..

Homer: Alright, I'll talk to Lisa's teacher this year; you can have Bart's.
Marge: That's the way we do it every year.
Homer: Alright, tell you what.  I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 50.
Marge: Is it 37?
Homer: D'oh!  I mean..  No.
Marge: Ho-mer...
Homer: Please, Marge?  Please, please, please, please, pleeease?
Marge: Oh, alright.
Homer: Woo-hoo!  U-S-A!  U-S-A!  U-S-A!

Homer forces his way into a desk only made for a kid an 1/8th his weight,
and amuses himself with gross bodily sound effects as Lisa's teacher writes
on the blackboard.  Meanwhile, in the 4th grade classroom..

Mrs. K: Bart has been guilty of the following atrocities: Synthesizing a
        laxative from peas and carrots; replacing my birth control pills
        with *Tic Tacs*...

Marge tries to apologise (``I'm sure Bart really doesn't mean to be bad.'')
Attention shifts quickly to the Simpson's living room.  A snoring Grampa
has Bart's full consideration.

Bart:   Now's our chance to be really bad...

At the Parent-Teacher night.

Mrs. Hoover: Mr. Simpson.  I just wanted to tell you that you've done a
        wonderful job with Lisa.  You must have read to her at a young age.
Homer:  I did!  I *did* read to her!

A quick flashback to some 5 or 6 years before to Homer "tutoring" a toddler
Lisa.

Homer: "8 O'clock; "Happy Days".  The Fonz (Henry Winkler) is afraid he's
        losing his cool.

Back in the 90s'.

Homer: I've always been a firm believer in the three R's:  Reading TV Guide,
       uh, 'Riting to TV Guide,  and, uh..  Renewing TV Guide.

In Mrs. Krabappel's room, an obviously stressed Marge is trying to cope.

Mrs. K: Now, we don't usually do this, but we have some witnesses.  Come in
        Arthur.  Now, where did Bart stick the fireworks?

As Arthur is about to identify a part of the doll that you generally don't
discuss in episode capsules, we return to the homestead where Bart
masterminds a heist on a snoring Grampa.

Bart: Over the lips and past the gums, look out dentures, here I come!

Bart liberates the dentures from their rightful owner and puts them in his
own mouth giving him a look reminiscent of Ren Hoek on a good day.

Homer: "My child is on the honour roll at Springfield Elementary".
       You know, I never thought I'd find a replacement for my "Where's the
       Beef?" bumper sticker.  Heh heh heh, "Where's the Beef?"

As Homer leaves the classroom, he inadvertently forgets something..

Mrs. H:  Uh, we'd like the desk back, Mr. Simpson.

Back home, Bart is getting some acrobatics practice now that he has the
strength of ten men's teeth.  At school, Marge is writing lines on the
blackboard (some sort of reverse heredity thing?)  Homer enters.

Marge: Homer, we have a problem here.
Homer: Are you kidding?  Lisa turned out perfect!  I won't stand here and
       have you badmouthing Lisa!
Marge: We're talking about Bart.
Homer: Oh.  That guy.

Mrs. K: I think the problem here is discipline.  If Bart does something wrong
        you should punish him.
Marge:  Well, we try.  But he has this way of making us think we've punished
        him when actually we've completely caved in.
Homer:  He's the boy you love to hate!

Mrs. K: I believe with persistent discipline, even the poorest student can
        end up becoming, oh, say, Chief Justice of The Supreme Court.
Homer:  Chief Justice of The Supreme Court.  What great men he would join:
        John Marshall.  Charles Evans Hughes.  Warren Berger.
        Hmmmm, Burger...

Perhaps Marge (like us) was shocked that Homer could name three justices,
but regardless, she envisions a much different future for a shoddy-looking,
overweight gigolo if things don't change.

P.A.:  Alright, ladies!  Prepare to be blown away by "Bang Bang" Bart!
Crowd: Boo!
Woman: You're fat!
Bart:  Just more of me to love, honey.

They return home as Bart tries to repair Grampa's broken dentures with
scotch-tape and returns them to their rightful mouth.  He makes it back to
the couch, picks up a stray book and welcomes his parents.

Bart:  Hi Mom!  Hi Dad!  Home already?  Boy, time really flies when you're
       readin'... "The Bible"!  Eeeeew!

Grampa: Blah bleh blah bleh blah...
Homer:  If you don't start making more sense, we're gonna hafta put you in
        a home.
Grampa: You already put me in a home.
Homer:  Then, we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on "60 Minutes".
Grampa: I'll be good.

Grampa: Look what your bad egg of a son did to my teeth!
Homer:  Dad, you and your stories: "Bart broke my teeth", "The nurses are
        stealing my money", "This thing on my neck is getting bigger"...

Marge:  Now this is *exactly* what Bart's teacher was talking about.
        Our son did something wrong and you looked the other way.
Homer:  But Marge, look at that hang-dog expression..  He's learned his
        lesson.  Let's get him a present.

Another reminder from Marge convinces Homer it's time to act.

Homer:  Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth, he gets to break yours.
Grampa: Oh, this is going to be *sweet*.

Instead, Bart is sent to his room without any supper.  After Homer's foiled
attempt to sneak food up to him and some desperate glances at SLH as an
entree, Bart stocks his position.

Bart:  Gee.  Maybe they mean it this time.  From now on, I guess I'd better
       straighten up and fly--
Homer: Bart.  Don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza.  Just
       promise me you'll try to be good.
Bart:  I promise.
Homer: Thatta boy.
Bart:  Heh heh heh, *sucker*

At a darkened retirement home Grampa attempts to `borrow' dentures belonging
to a neighbour..

Jasper: Well, well.  If it isn't the *tooth fairy*.

A advertisement for ``The Itchy and Scratchy Movie'' appears on the TV,
alerting Bart and Lisa for the first time.

TV Ad: If you want: Suspense!  Romance!  You'll find them in "The Itchy and
       Scratchy Movie"!  Coming soon to theatres near you!  (53% new footage)

Homer inquires into the state of the trash.

Homer: Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked?
Bart:  Indeed, I did.
Homer: D'oh!  Hey you goats!  Get out of here!

Bart:  Dad, you *could* punish me.  But then you'd have to think of a
       punishment, sit here and make sure I do it.
Homer: Ohhhh.
Bart:  Or, you could let me go over and play with Milhouse while you spend
       the afternoon watching unpredictable Mexican sitcoms!
TV:    [?]
Homer: Heh heh heh... Run along you little scamp!

After we see a unique blood-gushing billboard for the movie, Bart is in the
proceeds of destroying a packet of mustard on the living room floor.

Homer: Bart!  Why are you doing that?
Bart:  I dunno.
Homer: Well, this time you must be punished!
Bart:  Well, you *could* punish me, but--
Homer: No tricks, boy!  I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high
       water, I--  Wait a minute...  Ice cream truck!

As Homer and Bart enjoy their ice creams on the sidewalk..

Homer: Now, what were we talking about, boy?
Bart:  Uh, we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
Homer: Oh, yeah.  The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.

Later, Bart is tearing up the living-room carpet as the girls come home from
an afternoon of shopping.

Marge: We're home!
Lisa:  We got beets!

Marge: How could you let this happen?
Homer: How could *you* let this happen?
Marge: I wasn't here!
Homer: Oh, how *convenient*...

Marge: Homer, do you want your son to become Chief Justice of the Supreme
       Court, or a sleazy male stripper?
Homer: Can't he be both, like the late Earl Warren?
Marge: Earl Warren wasn't a stripper!
Homer: *Now* who's being naive?

Homer promises to punish Bart the next time he does something wrong.

Kent: Tonight on "Eye on Springfield", we meet a man who's been hiccupping
      for *45* years...
Man:  Hic!  Kill me.  Hic!  Kill me.

Kent: I'm here *live* in Korea to give you a first-hand look at how American
      cartoons are made.

"Eye on.." features a 1928 Scratchy called "That Happy Cat".  A primitive
Disney-styled Scratchy walks down the street...  That's all.  "Steamboat
Itchy" followed a year later, the debut for the cat and mouse team.  In
this, Itchy takes out Scratchy's knees with a machine gun, and slams his
head in an oven.  During the war, I&S teamed up to clobber Hitler, then
Itchy does the usual on Scratchy..  Homer enters the room.

Homer:  Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?
Bart:   Sounds like something you'd say.  Hey, where is she?

Maggie's behind the wheel of the Simpsonmobile taking her first driving
lesson.

Chief Wiggum: Oh, isn't that cute.  A baby driving a car.  And look, there's
              a dog driving a bus!

The car smashes into the penitentiary, releasing a few prisoners.

Convict: Alright!  Time for a crime spree!

Homer condemns Bart not to see I&S:TM, *ever*.  Meanwhile, an escaped felon
is looting electronics.

Convict: Oh, no!  Beta!

Bart:  Dad, you *gotta* let me see that movie.  Can't you just give me a
       spanking?  [drops pants]
       C'mon!  Go nuts!
Homer: Don't point that thing at me!

Lisa pleads with Homer to let Bart see the movie as it will be the defining
moment of their generation.  She reasons that it would be like not allowing
her father to see the Apollo Moon landing.  Homer flashes back to see that
he was preoccupied on a bean-bag chair and a set of headphones while
Armstrong's historic words were spoken.

Homer: Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got love in my tummy, and I feel like
       loving you!

Homer remains adamant and rejects the appeal.  The movie starts screening at
the Aztec cinema and the ticket line stretches all the way to the front of
Simpsons' house.

Homer: Some day you'll thank me for this, son.
Bart:  Not bloody likely.

Homer: Y'know when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt, but my Dad
       wouldn't get it for me.  So I held my breath until I passed out and
       banged my head on the coffee table.  The doctor thought I might have
       brain damage.
Bart:  Dad?  What's the point of this story?
Homer: I *like* stories...

Homer: You're welcome to watch whatever you want on TV.
Bart:  TV sucks.
Homer: I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that.

Bart attempts to amuse himself with his own imagined I&S cartoon.  Lisa
returns from the premiere.

Bart: How was it?
Lisa: It wasn't that great.
Bart: Be honest.
Lisa: It was the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life!!!  And you
      wouldn't believe all the stars who did cameos:  Dustin Hoffman,
      Michael Jackson; of course they didn't use their real names, but you
      could tell it was them...

Months have passed.  Bart is taunted at school.

Marge: Homer, we'd like to talk to you.
Homer: But then I won't be watching TV.  You can see the bind I'm in.
Lisa:  Dad, you've gotta let Bart see that movie.  I've never seen him like
       this.  He has the demented melancholia of a Tennessee Williams' heroine.

This latest appeal fails.  Bart tries to sneak into the movie, but is caught
by the Usher.  More months pass.

Kent: I'm here at the Springfield Aztec theatre where, after eight months,
      and nine Academy Awards, the Itchy and Scratchy movie is showing for
      the last time.  Tomorrow a new movie starring Liza Minelli and Mickey
      Rourke will open.  Will it be as successful?  Only time will tell...

The scene speeds ahead 40 years, where a Grampa-ish Homer and a middle-aged
Bart approach a movie house.

Bart:  Well, I'll be.  The Itchy and Scratchy movie.  C'mon, whaddya say?
Homer: Alright.  I think you've learned your lesson.
Bart:  One Senior Citizen and one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
Homer: I'll get it, son.
Clerk: That'll be 650 dollars.
Homer: D'oh...

At the concession stand.

Homer: Hmmm, Soylent Green.

The movie opens with Itchy tying up Scratchy to a railroad track.  Itchy
tries to get onto the train to run him over, but the engineer keeps kicking
him out. He goes to college, gets his Civil.Eng degree and graduates in full
engineering dress (cap, overalls, etc.)  He returns to the train where
Scratchy has *almost* freed himself from the ropes.  Itchy pulls a lever for
the train to move forward as a frantic Scratchy desperately scrambles to
untie the final knot.  The train guishes Scratchy, leaving nothing behind
but a drumstick and two (still twitching) arms.

Homer: Which one's the mouse?
Bart:  Itchy.
Homer: Itchy's a jerk.
