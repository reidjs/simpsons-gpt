> Title sequence
===============================================================================
Opening    :- The headless horseman gallops through an eerie woods.  He
              holds up Krusty's laughing head in his left hand,
              eventually hurling it at the camera, where it splatters
              red and smears, reading "The Simpsons Halloween Special
              VI".

Couch      :- The family drop down from the ceiling in front of the
              couch one at a time, their heads in nooses, their eyes
              open.

    ... the equations 1 + 1 = 2, P = NP, e^(pi*i) = -1, and 1782^12 +
        1841^12 = 1922^12 in 3D land?
    ... the hexadecimal string in 3D land, "46 72 69 6E 6B 20 72 75 6C
        65 73 21", decodes as "Frink rules!" in ASCII?

    ... it's 1:55 at the Ad Agency?

        instead of hooking behind his ears?
    ... Krusty's uniform says `Krustofsky' on the back, and he's number
        three?
    ... when you think about it, the whole nightmare sequence is Homer's
        fault?  (by turning up the thermostat)

    ... the graveyard sequence isn't used in this episode?

How could Homer have gotten the giant donut inside the house?  {ddg}

The message left by the footprint should have been backwards; it would
have been normal when written on the giant mascot itself.  {ddg}

Kent Brockman is eaten by a mascot, yet he appears intact in the end.
{rl}

The first time Lisa is seen facing left in the schoolyard, all of her
hair is there; only after she shows the cut-off part to Bart is it shown
missing.  {ddg}

Sherri and Terri's dresses had slashes on them; they must have been
wearing them when they had their nightmares.  {ddg}

Usually, the BETTER a school does on a standardized test, the more money
it receives.  (There's a story of a school in California whose sixth
graders threatened to do poorly on a test unless the class got a cut of
the additional money.)  {ddg}

When Martin is asleep in class, Lewis can be seen in the background, but
after Martin's death Lewis seems to disappear in other angles.  {jm}

Martin's Latin is wrong (see below).

Lisa's hair grows back.  {ddg}

Lisa doesn't open the can of Buzz cola before putting the baby bottle
top on it and giving it to Maggie.  {ddg}

The pets don't leave a bulge in the carpet when they hide under it.
{ddg}

When everyone gasps in "Homer^3", Marge's shoes are green.  {rl}

Bart's rope appears out of nowhere.  {jp}

When Homer goes into "Erotic Cakes", the door is already open but we
hear a "door-opening" sound effect.

===============================================================================
> Reviews
===============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold: Much better than ToH V, although I did miss any
    attempt to "frame" the vignettes.  "Attack" seemed like an
    afterthought, but "Nightmare" was hilarious, and "Homer^3" was a
    pleasant surprise (although the ending left me scratching my head.
    Erotic Cakes?  What the...) Grade: A-

Mark Richey: I wished that they had forgotten the first part and had
    given us more "Homer^3".  Finally, heavy hype that lives up to the
    billing.  Averaging my three grades together gives a B+ for the
    episode.

Don Del Grande: A-Minus - not quite up to the standard of last year, but
    still a funny episode; the live-action sequence at the end made up
    for an otherwise boring 3-D segment.

Chris Berg: The 3D Homer was better than I thought and IMHO one of the
    coolest things they've ever done.  I also think the key was to focus
    it on Homer and not anyone else.  I think the writers have come to
    realize who the real star of the show is.

Scott Fujimoto: The first story was OK, but nothing special.  Grade: B-.
    The second story was funnier, and Maggie finally got some action!
    Grade: B+/A-The third story was very different type of episode.
    Nicely done, both in computer animation and writing, right up to the
    ending.  Grade: A.

Joe Manfre: "50 ft eyesores" I enjoyed due to the "ignore the ads"
    ending (not so predictable), "Nightmare" was hilarious and another
    inspired use of Groundskeeper Willie, "Homer^3" was high on fx and
    low on inspiration but still fun and weird.  I'm a sucker for
    Halloween specials so I give it A-.

Adam Lipkin: Individually-- Attack: B-, Nightmare: B+, Homer^3: A.
    Attack's ending fell very flat very fast.  Yet another pointless
    celebrity cameo.  Nightmare worked very well, but again, the very
    end was weak.  Homer^3 was great all the way through.  Frink was
    hilarious.  Overall, a B+.

Ricardo Lafaurie: "Attack" -- A rather lifeless outing.  D. "Nightmare"
    -- Ooh, creepy.  Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than the
    Wolfman.  C+.  "Homer^3" -- HOLY MACARONI!  A. Overall -- Still
    would rather watch it than It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.  I
    want the graveyard back.  B-

Jose Lafaurie: I thought this Simpsons episode sucked.  I mean, did it
    suck or what?  And Homer^3 was just trying to camouflage the fact
    that...it sucked!  And you know, what a way to cap an episode.
    Homer's in the real world nd goes into Erotic Cakes stores.  So?
    What happens next.  Credits...It sucked.  D-

Dominik Halas: The first segment fell flat; however, the second act was
    more up to form, and the third act was awesome!  The animation was
    an incredible sight to behold, and the act was also brilliantly
    funny.  Homer^3 is one of the all-time best Halloween bits they've
    done.  Grade: A-.

John Martin: The "50 ft. eyesores" bit was an A. Loved the donut boy
    punting the dog down the street!  "Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace"
    was a B+.  Great parody of Freddy Krueger flicks.  Homer^3 was a
    C+/B-, however.  This one wasn't that funny.  The writers just
    thought "we'll wow 'em with the computer graphics!"  Overall, a high
    B+.

Tony Hill: It had its funny moments ("Aren't you tired of always being
    wrong?") and Homer and Bart in 3D will be memorable.  It was
    especially clever having SLH & S II appear as two-dimensional
    figures foreshadowing Homer's odyssey.  But the acerbic wit just
    wasn't there.  I give it a C+.

Yours truly: I didn't like "Attack" much (Anka was gratuitous), but
    loved the "Nightmare" takeoff (lots of great refs) and "Homer^3",
    which was an interesting concept and well-done.  I'd rank the THoH
    series from best to worst as II, V, IV, VI, I, III.  Grade: B.

>> The mascot with the black suit and top hat

Elson Trinidad says this mascot "is a ref to Western Exterminator Co., a
    Los Angeles-based pest control company, whose logo is a man in a top
    hat and black suit leaning over a rat with one hand shaking its
    index finger in a `no, no, no!' position and the other hand behind
    its back with a mallet.  If you're in L.A., the Western Exterminator
    logo can be seen from the Hollywood Freeway, near the Vermont Ave
    exit.  Van Halen borrowed the Western Exterminator man and the rat
    for its `1984' world tour logo."

>> The "Where's the Beef?" woman

This phrase has been used more than once in "The Simpsons".  Tony Hill
    gives some background: "Clara Peller was an octogenarian who did ads
    for Wendy's in which she mocked other chains' smaller burgers.  Her
    trademark lines were `Where's the beef?' and `That's a very large
    bun'.  `Where's the beef' became a well-known expression when Walter
    Mondale, running for President in 1984, challenged Gary Hart to put
    some meat in his campaign proposals.  Mondale was boosted on to
    nomination.  Peller, however, was fired by Wendy's after she did an
    ad for a dog food company using the line `I found the beef.'  She
    died a few years later.  The Mondale-Hart exchange was referenced in
    `Lisa's First Words'."

>> Paul Anka

Tony Hill writes, "Paul Anka, a Canadian singer-songwriter, originally
    claimed to be a rock and roll star (`Diana', `Puppy Love'), but of
    late, he is known as a MOR nightclub singer (`You're Havin' My
    Baby', `My Way')."  He wrote the theme for the "Tonight Show" too, I
    believe, and I heard he gets royalties every single time it gets
    played.  (Incidentally, he appears as a teenager in the movie
    "Girls' Town" starring Mamie Van Doren and Mel Torme, which was
    spoofed on "Mystery Science Theater" as the first show of their
    sixth season.  In "The Simpsons", his nose seemed large -- almost
    like in "Girls' Town".  Didn't he get a nose job?)

>> Norman Vincent Peale

Tony Hill explains, "The Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, author of `The Power
    of Positive Thinking,' was one of the founders of the self-help
    movement and was for many years the minister at Marble Collegiate
    Church in New York.  For the Where-Is-Springfield set, he was born
    in Bowersville, Ohio in 1898.  He died on Christmas Eve in 1993."

>> Martin's Latin

Christopher Jones corrects, "There is no verb `morire' in Latin.  The
    word he wants is `mori' (a deponent verb), to die; `moritur',
    he/she/it dies; `moreris', you die.  The incorrect `morire' is also
    included on the blackboard behind."

>> "That wheelchair guy"

Homer is referring to Stephen Hawking, author of the bestselling "A
    Brief History of Time" which talks a fair amount about black holes.
    Hawking is in a wheelchair because he has ALS, a degenerative
    disease that leaves one's mind intact while rendering the body
    useless.

>> "Tron"

Ricardo Lafaurie says, "`Tron' was a Disney movie back in the early '80s
    (that era of free spending) with some pretty cruddy computer
    animation.  It bombed, and no one watched it (except for perhaps me
    [and Chief Wiggum and Homer - ed]).  The landscape of the third
    dimension has a similarity to the landscape in the movie."

>> Some of the equations in 3D land

>>> 734

This is most probably a reference to the fact that when you write "7734"
    on a calculator and turn it upside down, it looks as though it reads
    "HELL".  Perhaps the three-letter version "HEL" in 3D land is like
    the "LUV" and "HAT" tattoos on Sideshow Bob's hands?

>>> e^(i*pi) = -1

This is called "Euler's formula", where "e" is the natural logarithm
    base (2.71828...), "i" is the square root of -1, and "pi" is the
    ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter (3.141593...
    ).

>>> P = NP

This is an unproven conjecture from computer science.  Luis Dissett
    explains, "`P' is the set of decision problems (i.e., problems that
    have a YES or a NO for answer) that can be solved in polynomial
    time; `NP' is the set of decision problems for which, if the answer
    is YES, then that can be proved in polynomial time.  These two sets
    are not necessarily equal, but they are not necessarily different
    either.  Whether they are equal or not is one of the major open
    problems in theoretical Computer Science."

>>> rho(m0) > 3(H_0)^2 / 8 (pi) G

Robert Mellish writes that this equation is from cosmology and is part
    of Einstein's General Relativity work.  "H sub 0 is the Hubble
    constant, and G is the gravitational constant.  It's the formula for
    working out the critical density of the universe.  If the density of
    the universe is greater than the critical density, it will
    eventually collapse back on itself -- that is what the formula is
    saying.  Hey, and they said physics was useless..."

>>> 1782^12 + 1841^12 = 1922^12

Without calculating it exactly, this equation cannot hold for two
    reasons:

    - 1782^12 is even, 1841^12 is odd, and thus their sum is odd, but
      1922^12 is even
    - it contradicts Fermat's last theorem, which says that x^n+y^n=z^n
      for x, y, and z positive integers is never true for n greater than
      two.  Pierre Fermat, a French mathematician, wrote in a notebook
      in 1787 that he had a wonderful proof for this theorem, only that
      the margin was too small to contain it.  No one managed to prove
      it until 1993 when Andrew Wiles, a professor at Princeton,
      succeeded.  It is widely believed now that Fermat had no easy
      proof for it; Wiles' proof is over 200 pages long.
      
      The exact values are close:
   
      1782^12 = 1025397835622633634807550462948226174976
      1841^12 = 1515812422991955541481119495194202351681
          sum = 2541210258614589176288669958142428526657
      1922^12 = 2541210259314801410819278649643651567616
   
>> I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here!

As Ondre Lombard explains, Homer really isn't wasting any money at all:
    "Writer David S. Cohen approached David Silverman with the idea of
    a computer-animated sequence.  The 'Simpsons' staff went to 
    California-based computer animation company Pacific Data Images,
    which set aside a portion of their budget for self-promotional
    projects.  PDI was quite eager to get world-wide exposure and sank
    their self-promotional budget into 'Homer ^3' -- giving 'Treehouse
    of Horror VI' a segment animated free of charge."

>> Where the "Erotic Cakes" store is

Elson Trinidad writes that it's at Ventura Blvd. at Ventura Canyon Av.
    in Sherman Oaks, California.  "I was in the Valley today and decided
    to take a stab at the location.  My positive clues -- it's in the
    west-central part of LA's San Fernando Valley, along the 13500 block
    of some street.  There were about 8 or so possible locations,
    thankfully I followed my first instinct: Ventura Blvd, the main
    shopping thoroughfare in the south portion of the Valley.
    
    There is no real `Erotic Cakes' storefront; that was made up for the
    scene.  The real storefront is Rose Photography, 13567 Ventura Blvd.
    The establishment appears to be mostly vacant, save for a few
    ladders.  It's right between Yoshi's Japanese Restaurant (red roof)
    and The Coffee Roaster.
    
    The other stores in the background were there: `..SS MACHINES'
    (House of Business Machines), `INTERIOR DESIGN' (Sherman Oaks
    Interior Design), `TAILORS' (Hernandez Bros.  Tailors) and `AMBER
    JEWELRY' (actually, Earthly Treasures, with `Amber Jewelry' on the
    side awning).  And yes, there is a `THAI' restaurant farther east,
    in the distance."

Willy: When I'm done with you, they'll have to do a compost-mortem!
-- Witty retorts, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% Willy shifts himself into high gear and tromps the gas, flying toward
% Bart and growling.  When he hits the sandbox, though, his wheels turn
% uselessly.  "Sinky sand!" he cries, morphing into several different
% (tartan) shapes before turning into himself and sinking into the sand.

  Bart: [sighs with relief] Willy's gone for good.  Now I can get back
        to my normal dreams: me and Krusty winning the Super Bowl!
         [Krusty, dressed in a football uniform, runs up as a crowd
        cheers]
Krusty: Bart, there's two seconds left.  Now listen up.  It's your basic
        Statue of Liberty play with one twist: you throw it to me!
        Knute Rockne called it the forward pass.
         [behind Bart, a giant tartan spiderlike bagpipe with Willy's
        head on it rises from the sandbox]
        Now, the clock's still running, so it's important we start this
        play as quickly as possible.
  Bart: [getting grabbed] Aah!
Krusty: Oh, boy.  Don't dream about me no more, kid.  [runs off]
-- Some supportive clown _he_ is, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

Bart: Help, Lisa!  Help!
Lisa: [running toward the sandbox] Bart, you're in trouble!  Wake up!
Bart: Wait a minute...if you're here, then you've fallen asleep too!
Lisa: I'm not asleep, I'm justing resting my ey -- uh oh.  Aah!
       [gets grabbed by Willy, who continues sinking into the sand]
      Goodbye, Bart.
Bart: Goodbye, Lis.  Hope you get reincarnated as someone who can stay
      awake for fifteen minutes!
-- Bart, closet Buddhist, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% All seems lost until Maggie appears and blocks Willy's exit hole with
% her pacifier.  Willy tries vainly to pull it out, but he expands
% gradually until he explodes, raining scraps of tartan all over the
% place.  The three children fly up to the moon, circle it, then land on
% their couch and awaken.  "You saved us, Maggie!" says Lisa, hugging
% her.  Maggie pulls out another pacifier, twiddles it around, and puts
% it in her mouth.
%
% The three of them walk out the front door the next morning.

 Lisa: I don't know, Bart.  Something tells me Willy's still out there,
       and that he could come back at any time in any form and kill us
       in ways we can't even imagine!
        [a bus pulls up; Willy gets off]
Willy: Boo!  [laughs] [makes some faces and noises]
        [the bus leaves]
       Stop!  I left my gun on the seat.  Hey!
        [he starts chasing it, then turns back] Wait here, please.
        [he runs off, losing his shoe, while a saxophone plays the theme
       song]

% Third segment title: "Homer^3"
%
% Outside, thunder crashes as Marge calls out to Homer.

Marge: Homer!  Get ready!  Patty and Selma will be here any minute.
Homer: D'oh!  Oh no...better ride this one out in the closet.
        [opens it to see Bart and Lisa standing there]
 Lisa: Sorry, Dad.  This is our spot.
Homer: Oh yeah?  Well it's _my_ house, so it's _my_ spot.
 Bart: N'uh uh, because we called it.
Homer: Did not!
 Lisa: Well, we're calling it now.
Homer: [plaintive] You are?
 Bart: 'Fraid so.
Homer: Ohh, they got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.
-- Which they learned from Matlock, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% Homer checks under the carpet in front of the TV, but the pets have
% already claimed that spot for themselves.  The doorbell rings.

Marge: [hearing the doorbell] Just a second!
Homer: D'oh!  [whimpers] Huh?  [spots a bookcase]
       I never looked behind this whatchamacallit case before.
        [chuckles; leans on wall, but his hand goes through it]
       Huh?  [swirls his hand around] It's like something out of that
       twilighty show about that zone.
        [Marge opens the door]
Patty: How's it hanging, Marge?
Selma: Ugh!  I'm baking like a meatloaf under this wet wool.
        [opens coat closet, catches Bart and Lisa hiding there]
 Bart: Uh...[nervous smile] may I take your coat, Aunt Selma?
 Lisa: Um...I would also like to take your coat.
Selma: Have we got a family activity for you:
Patty: A pillowcase full of seashells from our trip to Sulfur Bay.
Selma: You can help us clean and organize them.
Patty: And pry out all the dead hermit crabs.  Get a screwdriver.
-- Fun?  Wow, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% Homer will have none of it.

Homer: I'll take my chances in the mystery wall!
        [goes into it]
        [steps out into 3D land, looks around]
        [thinking] Oh, glory of glories.  Oh heavenly testament to the
       eternal majesty of God's creation.
        [out loud] Holy macaroni!
Patty: [sucking on a hermit crab] Hey!  You can just _suck_ 'em out!
Homer: [disembodied] Hello?  Can anybody hear me?
Marge: Homer!  Where are you?
Homer: Uh, I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.
Marge: Do you see towels?  If you see towels, you're probably in the
       linen closet again.
Homer: Just a second...no, it's a place I've never been before.
Selma: Hmm.  The shower.  [laughs]
-- Strike one, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% "Hey!"  Homer calls out indignantly.  He looks around and scratches
% himself.

Homer: I don't want to alarm you, Marge, but I seem to be trapped in
       here.
Marge: Hmm.  I better call Ned.  He has a ladder!
        [in 3D land]
Homer: What's going on here?  I'm so bulgy.
        [taps his belly; it ripples for a while]
       My stomach sticks way out in front and my -- aah!
        [checks out his bulgy behind]
        [in the living room]
  Ned: [on top of his ladder] Well, as the tree said to the lumberjack,
       I'm stumped.
Selma: Hmm.  It's like he just disappeared into fat air.  [laughs]
Homer: Hey!  Shut up.
-- Strike two, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% In the background, a cone bounces off the green grid Homer is standing
% on.  He walks past a building, strangely reminiscent of a building in
% a certain video game, and up to a swimming pool with fish in it.
% "Mmm...unprocessed fish sticks," he slobbers.  His drool hits the pool
% and frightens the fish away.
%
% He walks up to a sign with arrows pointing along the three axes, X, Y,
% and Z.

Homer: Man, this place looks expensive.  I feel like I'm wasting a
       fortune just standing here.
        [scratches and looks around]
       Well, better make the most of it.
        [burps]
-- Homer in 3D land, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% The bouncing cone lodges itself in his butt.  "Ow!  Watch it, coney!"
% He pulls it out and tosses it away.  It lodges itself in the ground,
% point down, and creates a depression that begins deepening at an
% alarming rate.  "Oops," he says meekly.
%
% Marge has called Rev. Lovejoy and Dr. Hibbert in to help.

Lovejoy: Do you see a light, Homer?
  Homer: [disembodied] Yes...
Lovejoy: Move into the light, my son.
  Homer: [a buzzing is heard] Aah!
Hibbert: Homer, this is your physician, Dr. Julius Hibbert.  Can you
         tell us what it's like in there?
  Homer: Uh...it's like...did anyone see the movie "Tron"?
Hibbert: No.
   Lisa: No.
  Marge: No.
 Wiggum: No.
   Bart: No.
  Patty: No.
 Wiggum: No.
    Ned: No.
  Selma: No.
  Frink: No.
Lovejoy: No.
 Wiggum: Yes.  I mean -- um, I mean, no.  No, heh.
-- "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% Frink draws a strange diagram on the wall.

    Lisa: Well, where's my Dad?
   Frink: Well, it should be obvious to even the most dim-witted
          individual who holds an advanced degree in hyperbolic
          topology, n'gee, that Homer Simpson has stumbled into...[the
          lights go off] the third dimension.
    Lisa: [turning the lights back on] Sorry.
   Frink: [drawing on a blackboard] Here is an ordinary square --
  Wiggum: Whoa, whoa -- slow down, egghead!
   Frink: -- but suppose we exte-end the square beyond the two
          dimensions of our universe (along the hypothetical Z axis,
          there).
Everyone: [gasps]
   Frink: This forms a three-dimensional object known as a "cube", or a
          "Frinkahedron" in honor of its discoverer, n'hey, n'hey.
   Homer: [disembodied] Help me!  Are you helping me, or are you going
          on and on?
   Frink: Oh, right.  And, of course, within, we find the doomed
          individual.
-- The frightening conclusion, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

Wiggum: Enough of your borax, poindexter!  We need action --
         [fires his gun six times through the wall]
        Take that, you lousy dimension!
         [the bullets fly toward Homer, but spiral around the widening
        hole and get sucked into it]
 Homer: Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics.  I wish I'd
        read that book by that wheelchair guy.
-- Homer, Hawking ignoramus, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% He leans into the hole, but his head gets sucked in and elongated
% grotesquely.  He manages to pull it out, but the hole begins widening
% with an alarming rapidity.  He has to run to keep ahead of it.

  Abe: [wearing a diving suit] I'll save Homer!  All I needs is four
       stout men to work the bellows.
Frink: No, pops, it's too risky!  For all we know, there could be cubes
       in there the size of gorillas and other large --
Homer: [disembodied] Help!  I don't have much time.
 Bart: [tying a rope around his waist] That does it.  I'm going in.
Marge: Bart, no!
        [Bart goes in through the wall and looks around]
 Bart: Cool, man!
-- Bart enters 3D land, "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% Homer is nearing the edge of the green grid.

  Homer: [panicky] Oh my God, I'm going to be sucked into a black hole,
         I'm going to be sucked into oblivion, I'm going to be nothing,
         and what's going to be coming out the other side, I don't know!
   Bart: I'll save you, Dad!
          [climbs onto XYZ street sign]
         I can't get any closer...you'll have to jump!
  Homer: Piece of cake, son.
          [runs into hole, breaks into pieces]
         Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap --
          [the world explodes in a flash as Bart gets pulled back]
  Marge: Bart!  What happened?
   Bart: Well...we hit a little snag when the universe sort of collapsed
         on itself.  But Dad seemed cautiously optimistic!
  Homer: [disembodied] Craaaap!
  Marge: Oh, Homey.
Lovejoy: Be strong, Marge: I'm sure he's gone to a better place.
          [lightening fizzles; Homer appears in our world, screaming,
         and falls into a dumpster]
  Homer: D'oh!  [gets out] Ew...this is the worst place yet.
-- He's got that right., "Treehouse of Horror VI"

% He walks down a street somewhere in California.  People stop to look
% at the stranger from another universe.  Homer whimpers incoherently as
% he keep walking, but then he spots a store he likes.  "Ooh!  Erotic
% cakes," he coos, walking in.
%
% [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:27]
%
% The credits are displayed in green as the camera slowly rises over the
% erotic cakes shop.  The theme song sounds as though it's from the
% video game "Myst".  Similar-style music plays over the Gracie logo.
