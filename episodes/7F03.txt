> Review
===============================================================================
Yours Truly @{rjc}: Another classic.  Bart a three-dimensional
character.  Marge the consummate mother.  (``Ooh, your third bowl!'')
Lisa precocious, but still with the eyes of a child.  And Homer being
just plain Homer, rather than the exaggerated Homer-caricature of
later seasons.

===============================================================================
>> Lisa's Quote

Al Wesolowsky {abw} reports:

    Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. -- Samuel Johnson (1709-1884)

    The quotation is dated 7 Apr 1775 and appears on p. 348 of vol. ii of
    Boswell's `Life of Johnson' (I.F Powell's revision of G.B. Hill's edition).

Jym Dyer {jd} adds:

    Ambrose Bierce, author of `The Devil's Dictionary', adds a bit more:

              I beg to submit that it is the first.

>> Trailers

Bart's prayer scene was used in a FOX advertisement before the season started.
The scene was redubbed so that Bart said, ``Dear God, please make more people
watch us on Thursdays at 8.  Especially women in the 18 to 35 age group.''
(Or something like that.)

>> Maggie falls

    1   Getting off the couch after watching Itchy and Scratchy
    1   When Bart calls Milhouse
    1   When the radio announces that SNPP is closed

>> The First Continental Congress

Stupid California textbooks.  ``Could the delegates agree on
recommendations that all Americans could support?''  Yeah, right.
Typical Anglo-centric view of history.

>> The St. Louis Compact

Just in case you didn't know, the Pilgrims came over on the Mayflower.  The
Spirit of St. Louis was the plane that Charles Lindbergh flew across the
Atlantic.

>> More Powerful than Mom and Dad and the Superfriends

I've heard tell that Channel 24 in St. Louis had a commercial for Jesus
during the Underdog Show that proclaimed that He was more powerful than the
Batman, Superman, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman COMBINED.  Which got me
thinking--if we could convince the Wonder Twins to help out, then maybe...

Any information on this commercial would be greatly appreciated.

>> Miscellaneous

    One guess how John Hancock was writing his name in the snow.

% Springfield Elementary School.  Martin completes his book report, titled
% ``An Afternoon With Ernest Hemingway:  Reflections by Martin'', complete
% with beard and fishing pole props.  Ms. Krabappel gushes in admiration.
% Bart slips a packet on Martin's seat.  ``A little ketchup for your buns,
% Papa?''  (*splort*)  Next up is Bart.

Fellow students, prepare to be dazzled!  [walks to the front of the room]
Well, as Mrs. Krabappel already mentioned, the name of the book that I
read is <Treasure Island>.  It's about these... [describing the book jacket]
pirates... with patches over their eyes...  and...  shiny gold teeth...
and green birds on their shoulders...  [pause]
Did I mention this book was written by a guy named Robert Lewis Stevenson?
And published by the good people at McGraw Hill.  So, in conclusion,
on the Simpson scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, one being
the lowest, and five being average, I give this book... a nine.
Any questions?   [hands go up]   Nope?  Then I'll just sit down.
-- Bart's book report, ``Bart Gets an F''

% Ms. Krabappel asks Bart if he actually read the book.

Mrs. Krabappel, I am insulted.  Is this a book report or a witch hunt?
-- Bart takes offence when Mrs.K accuses him of not reading the book
   he is doing a report on, ``Bart Gets an F''

% She challenges him to tell the class the name of the pirate.
% Bart thinks frantically to himself... ``Blackbeard... Captain Nemo...
% Captain Hook...  Long John Silver... Pegleg Pete... Bluebeard...''
% He guesses Bluebeard.  He guesses wrong.
%
% After class...

I will not fake my way through life.
-- Bart's blackboard punishment, ``Bart Gets an F''

Ms.K: Your grades have gotten steadily worse since the beginning of the term.

Bart: Yes, ma'am.
Ms.K: Are you aware that there is a major exam tomorrow on colonial America?
Bart: Yes, ma'am.
Ms.K: Blah blah, blah-blah.  Blah blah blah blah blah?
Bart: Yes, ma'am.
Ms.K: Blah blah.  Blah-blah blah, blah blah blah.
Bart: Yes, ma'am.
Ms.K: Bart!  You haven't been paying attention to a word I said, have you.
Bart: Yes, ma'am.
Ms.K: Well, then what did I say?
Bart: Uhhhhhh... Straighten up and fly right?
Ms.K: Pah!  That was a lucky guess.
-- Yes, ma'am, ``Bart Gets an F''

% House''.  Bart resolves, ``A couple more games, then I'll hit the books.''

%
% Bart (sipping a soda), Lisa and Maggie watch Itchy and Scratchy.  The episode

% after dinner, it's down to business.''
%
% At dinner...

Homer: Marge, could you get me another beer, please.
Marge: Just a second, Homer.  Lisa has some good news.

Homer: Sure I do!  I just want to have a beer while I'm caring.
-- It's like walking and chewing gum, ``Bart Gets an F''

% Lisa got an A on her vocabulary test.  Homer proudly tapes the test to the

% drawing labelled ``Cat'', drawn by Bart.  Homer decides pick up that beer
% while he's there.
%
% Homer remembers that it's Big Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie.  Bart
% tries to go study, but Homer yanks him into the living room.  Homer and
% Bart watch ``Gorilla the Conqueror'' together.  ``Oh, well, maybe just
% one more hour.''  The movie ends with the gorilla, in a cage, set adrift
% at sea.  Homer sobs, ``It's so unfair...  Just because he's different.''
% Bart leaves for his room to study.
%
% Bart enthusiastically cracks open his history book.  He tries reading
% but dozes off.

Homer: Pssst.  Marge, come take a look at this.
       [Bart has fallen asleep at his desk]
Marge: Oh... the little tiger tries so hard.

Bart: Hey, Otto.  I got a big test today I am <not> ready for.
      Could you please crash the bus or something?
Otto: Oh, ho, sorry, little buddy.  Can't do it on purpose.
      But, hey!  Maybe you'll get lucky!
-- ``Bart Gets an F''

% Bart decides to find a seat next to an egghead, pump him for some answers,
% and ``boom, back on Easy Street''.  He selects Sherry and Terry.  But
% they see him coming and have a surprise in store.

Bart:   Good morning, girls!
Sherry+Terry:  Good morning, Bart!
Bart:   Say... Who's up for a little cram session?  I'll go first.
        What was the name of the Pilgrims' boat?
Sherry: The Spirit of St. Louis.
Bart:   [taking notes]  And where'd they land?
Terry:  Sunny Acapulco.
Bart:   And why'd they leave England?
Sherry: Giant rats.
Bart:   Cool!  History's coming alive!

% The girls giggle.  Martin overhears the conversation.
%
% As Bart gets off the bus, Martin (though he's not sure why he's doing it)
% warns Bart that the answers the girls gave him were wrong.  ``A blindfolded
% chimp with a pencil in his teeth has a better chance of passing this test
% than you do.''
%
% In class...

Ms.K: All right, class, take one and pass the rest back.  [hands out exams]
Bart: [to himself]  Think, Simpson, think.  Crisis brings out the best in you.
      [convulses and collapses on the floor, moaning]
Ms.K: Ugh.  What is it, Bart.
Bart: [climbing back to his seat]  Nothing... Must... take... test...
      [falls back to the floor]
-- Bart the Thespian, ``Bart Gets an F''

% Bart leaves the classroom clutching his stomach.  He dances through the
% hallway, then resumes his histrionics when he reaches the nurse's office.
% The nurse is on the floor picking up a dropped jar of tongue depressors.

Nurse: [concerned]  What's the matter, son?
Bart:  [clutching his stomach]  Sharp, stabbing pains... in my stomach.
Nurse: Oh dear, I've heard of this... [consults a medical reference book,
       opens to the page ``Amoria Phlebitis'']
       Do you feel a shooting pain in your arm?
Bart:  [waving his arms]  Both of them.
Nurse: Temporary loss of vision?
Bart:  [blindly]  Huh?  Who said that?  Come closer...
-- Live from the Improv, ``Bart Gets an F''

% In his bed, Bart finishes another bowl and rings a bell.  Marge comes in,
% and Bart asks for another dish of double-capuccino chocolate-fudge.  Marge
% is pleased that Bart seems to be recovering, since this is his third bowl.
% Marge asks if there's anything else, and Bart asks for the TV set.
% Marge calls downstairs to Homer (who is watching a gorilla movie),
% ``Bring the television up.  Bart's got his vision back!''

I wish *I* had Amoria Phlebitis...
-- Homer, ``Bart Gets an F''

% Bart.''  Bart responds, ``Well, everyone better keep their mouth shut.''
% Bart calls Milhouse to get the answers to the exam.
%
% Bart breezes through the exam.  Ms. Krabappel grades it on the spot.
% ``This test is worse than Milhouse's exam!''  This is the final straw.
%
% Homer and Marge join Bart in the classroom.

Mrs.K: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, I think you know our district psychiatrist
       Dr. J. Loren Pryor.
Homer: Hey, Dr. J.
Dr.J.: [ahem]  I think we have on our hands here a classic case of what
       laymen refer to as fear of failure.  As a result Bart is an
       underachiever and yet he seems to be... How shall I put this...
       proud of it?
Homer: Hmmm.
Dr.J.: One of his problems may be his short attention span which can lead
       to blah blah blah blah...
Homer: Uh-huh.
Dr.J.: Blah blah blah, blah blah blah...
Homer: Mmmm...
-- Bart is close to failing fourth grade, ``Bart Gets an F''

% Unlike the other students in the class, Bart has not shown any improvement
% over the semester.  Indeed, his grades have gotten worse.  Bart cracks.
% ``Okay, okay!  Why are we dancing around the obvious?  I know it, you know
% it.  I am <dumb>, okay?  Dumb as a post!  Think I'm happy about it?''
% Dr. Pryor reluctantly recommends that Bart be held back.  Bart protest,
% but Marge suggests it might not be so bad.  Bart continues his protests.

Look at my eyes!  See the sincerity?  See the conviction?  See the fear?
-- Bart learns he might be held back a grade, ``Bart Gets an F''

As God as my witness, I can pass the fourth grade!
-- Bart, ``Bart Gets an F''

% Adds Homer, ``And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the
% other kids.''
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 9:33]  (Wow, a long one.)

Otto: Get off the bus or forever hold your peace, little dudes!
Bart: Otto, you know I respect you.  I mean, you always let us throw
      stuff at cars and try to tip the bus on sharp turns.
Otto: Heh, damn thing never goes over, does it?  [unintelligible
      `ga-hah' noise]  So what's in your head little man?
Bart: Well, I've been failing a lot of tests recently.
Otto: Yeah huh...
Bart: And, now they're talking about holding me back in the fourth grade
      if I don't shape up.
Otto: That's it?  Hey, relax, man!  It could end up being the best thing
      that ever happened to ya.  I got held back in the fourth grade myself,
      twice!  Look at me, man!  Now I <drive> the school bus!
-- ``Bart Gets an F''

% Bart trudges into school.
%
% In class, the phrase ``repeat the fourth grade'' echos through Bart's head
% as he slips into a daydream.  An elderly Ms. Krabappel asks an adult Bart,
% ``What was the pirate's name in <Treasure Island>?''  Bart responds, ``Look,
% lady.  I got a peptic ulcer, my wife's hocking me for a new car, and I need
% a root canal.  Willya quit buggin' me about the stupid pirate!'' Bart, Jr.
% whispers the answer to his father, but Ms. Krabappel catches him and asks
% to see them both after class.
%
% Bart wakes up when a baseball bounces off his forehead.  The ball rolls
% over near Martin, who is seated under a tree reading.  When Martin throws
% the ball like a girl, the other kids laugh.  Martin returns to the
% forecastle of the Pequod.  Bart gets an idea.  He asks Martin to help him
% pass.

Bart:   I can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you so much.
Martin: They... laugh at me?  I've always considered myself rather popular.
Bart:   You're not.  Watch.  [pushes Martin down, crowd laughs]
Martin: But... but my speed with numbers... [Bart helps Martin to his feet]
        my years of service as a hall monitor, my prize-winning dioramas?
        These things mean nothing to them?
Bart:   Perhaps another demonstration.  [pushes him down again, more laughs]
-- ``Bart Gets an F''

% Martin gets the point.  Asks Bart, ``Then it's Adil?''  Martin agrees.
%
% First order of business is to inspect Bart's study area.  Bart shows Martin
% to his room.  ``There's a desk under that junk over there.''  Martin says
% the room must be cleaned, and some ferns added.

No study area is complete without adequate plant life.
-- Martin, ``Bart Gets an F''

% Bart and Martin get on the school bus.

Martin: [takes a seat at the front of the bus]
Bart:   No!
Martin: No?
Bart:   Only geeks sit in the front seat.  From now on, you sit in the
        back row.  And that's <not> just on the bus, it goes for school and
        church, too.
Martin: Why?
Bart    [mezzo voce]  So no one can see what you're doing!
Martin: Ooooh.. I think I understand... [grabs pencil, starts writing]
        the potential for mischief varies inversely with one's proximity
        to the authority figure!   [Shows his equation to Bart: M \propto 1/P]
Bart:   Well, yeah, but don't say it like that...

% Martin adds a fern to Bart's shiny-clean room.
%
% Bart teaches Martin how to shoot a slingshot, but the rubber band snaps

%
% Martin and Bart sit under a tree, reading a comic book and a history

% Bart reminds Martin about the history test, but Martin is too busy
% having fun.  ``Life's too short for tests!''  Bart leads the other
% boys (except for Bart) to the arcade.
%
% In his room, Bart doodles in his textbook.  Marge pops in and reminds
% Bart that it's past his bedtime.  Bart reluctantly closes the book.
% ``This is hopeless.''

Bart: [praying] Well, old timer, I guess this is the end of the road.  I know
      I haven't always been a good kid, but, if I have to go to school
      tomorrow, I'll fail the test and be held back.  I just need one more
      day to study, Lord.  I need Your help!
Lisa: [watching] Prayer... the last refuge of a scoundrel.
Bart: A teachers strike, a power failure, a blizzard... Anything that'll
      cancel school tomorrow.  I know it's asking a lot, but if anyone can do
      it, You can!  Thanking You in advance, Your pal, Bart Simpson.
