Blackboard:     I WILL NOT SCREAM / FOR ICE CREAM

Couch:          Hair dryers go over OFF's heads.  They go up and each has
                another's hairstyle:  Homer has Lisa's, Marge has Bart's, Bart
                has Lisa's, Lisa has Bart's, and Maggie has Marge's.  Maggie
                tips over from weight of her new 'do.  {hl}

==============================================================================
> Did You Notice...
==============================================================================
   ... Bart has a Sony Playstation (or clone thereof)?
   ... Nelson has a "Salesman of the Month" plaque in his "office"?
   ... Kirk shoots Luann a nasty look when Atkins mentions cheating on one's
       spouse?
   ... the grant check is for $250,000?

Brad Bizzolt:
   ... Homer can do math in his head when he's on the scale?

Don Del Grande:
   ... Lisa's never read "The Wind in the Willows"?
   ... all of the uncaught cheaters' grades were counted in determining
       whether or not the school gets its grant?
   ... an elementary school is getting an expensive scoreboard - and paying
       cash for it?  (See below)
   ... the check was for $250,000, marked "Department of the State Treasurer",
       and  signed "Comptroller Atkins"?
   ... Fat Tony is in the audience at the ceremony (behind Helen)?

Yuri Dieujuste:
   ... OFF has cable?
   ... lobsters are mammals according to Homer?
   ... this is the second episode.  in which some member of OFF gets in
       trouble with video games?

Jordan Eisenberg:
   ... this is the first episode this season w/o Kent Brockman?
   ... the scene where Marge drops Lisa off at school is particularly sloppy?
       It looks more like something out of South Park!
   ... apparently, Willie's already had some bad luck with a plunger (the one
       on the floor next to him is snapped in half)?
   ... for once, Homer puts his heart ahead of his stomach?
   ... Homer and Marge wear the same lobster bib?
   ... the last animation Skinner punched into the scoreboard was appropriate,
       seeing as how Lisa dropped the proverbial bomb mentioning
       Superintendent Chalmers?
   ... Bart's studious doppelganger makes an encore appearance sitting behind
       Martin later on in the episode?

Alex Foley:
   ... Martin Prince's dad at church?
   ... Ralph sticks a pencil up his nose during a test?
   ... when Pinchy becomes a free-range lobster, the fish are gone?
   ... Pinchy eats the food Homer gave him for dinner?

Curtis Gibby:
   ... when Martin answers "delicious," Bart's still got his latex creation in
       the classroom, reading from a 3-ring binder?

Joe Green:
   ... the "Employees Must Wash Hands" sign in Nelson's stall?
   ... the irony of Mr. Toad using an Aussie accent?
   ... Lisa doesn't seem upset about Homer wanting to eat a lobster?  [See
       "Comments" section for more]
   ... Bart's Lisa dummy was less realistic than his dummy of himself?

John Jensen:
   ... Homer refers to the Lobster as a "Helpless little mammal" when it is
       not a mammal?

Darrel Jones:
   ... the seaweed in Lisa's educational show looks like cornstalks?
   ... Alison is seen taking the test?
   ... Nelson's "desk" in the boy's room is a box of paper towels?
   ... the grant check is for $250,000.00?

Joe Klemm:
   ... the brown Itchy in Lisa's room
   ... Mrs. Lovejoy faints during the test run of the grant acceptance?  ["The
       real joke was that she STOOD UP to faint," says Andrew Levine]

Haynes Lee:
   ... Ralph's Coleco computer looks like a PET?

Tyler McHenry:
   ... that Nelson found some way to keep the toilet tank from filling
       (otherwise all of his papers would be wet!)?
   ... that Ralph appears right after Lisa says "I hope I don't run into that
       dwarf (gnome?) again!"?
   ... that Miss Hoover expected the whole class (even the stupid kids) to
       read and be ready for a test on "The Wind in the Willows" in 2 days?
   ... that Marge hangs all of Lisa's papers in a stack rather than all over
       the fridge?
   ... that The scoreboard control has about eight buttons, but Skinner STILL
       can't figure it all out?

Brian Rawson-Ketchum:
   ... at least Homer knows a lobster isn't a fish?  [Well, I suppose that's
       something -- Ed.]

Jeremy Reaban:
   ... Homer normally weighs 239, so if he and the lobster weigh 300, then the
       lobster must weigh 61 lbs.?
   ... "Bolonium" or "Bolognium" (Bo) apparently replaces Molybdenum (Mo,
       element #26) in the periodic table from Oscar Meyer?  [See "Comments"
       section for more]

Mark Aaron Richey:
   ... Ralph turns his head when Lisa says he brought her the book?
   ... Bart is playing with a yo-you in the hall?
   ... Nelson's rolodex is a roll of toilet paper?
   ... SES's mascot is still a puma?

Benjamin Robinson:
   ... Ralph drew a picture of the sun, himself, and Lisa on the book?  (I
       guess he's still carrying a torch for her.)
   ... Marge praises Lisa's eight years of "scrupulous honesty" right before
       Lisa does something less than scrupulous?
   ... Marge uses a horseshoe magnet to clamp Lisa's paper to the fridge?
   ... the photo of a football player (probably of Skinner) on Skinner's wall
       when Lisa confesses to cheating?
   ... at least the chemical abbreviations on the Oscar Meyer periodical chart
       look accurate?
   ... they remembered to give the real comptroller a different voice?  Nice
       touch.
   ... Bart's facility with latex dummies comes in handy later in the episode?

Samuel Sklaroff:
   ... the game controllers are shaped like Playstation controllers, but
       they're too dark in color?
   ... This episode takes place in April, judging by the calendar?
   ... Nelson's picture has "Salesman of the Month" written under it?
   ... Pyro sits between Luann and Kirk Van Houten?

Aaron Veenstra:
   ... that tonight was the third straight episode with a full opening?  [This
       eventually would become standard operating procedure for the new season
       -- Ed.]

=  Dr. Hibbert looks odd when he's getting up from his pew in church.  His
   dark eyebrows are missing, and his body looks small and wrongly drawn.
   {ol}

+  OFF usually seem to head straight for home after church.  {ad}

*  If OFF went to church on Sunday, and Lisa skipped school on Monday, and
   pretended to be sick Tuesday morning, and went to school three days later,
   that would make it a Friday.  But we see her in school for one more day!
   So either they slipped us quietly from Friday night to Monday morning
   between scenes, or the kids went to school on a Saturday.  {je}

*  How could Lisa been playing her video game if it wasn't plugged into the
   television?  {jr}

*  The video game system is neither hooked up to an electrical outlet, nor the
   TV.  Lisa also had it on the bed, which in a real PSX, would cause it to
   overheat (they're somewhat notorious for that)  {jr2}

+  In this episode, the school gets more funding because Lisa did well on the
   standardized test.  However, in "The Simpsons Hallowe'en Special VI",
   Krabapple said, "The worse you do on this standardized test, the more
   funding the school gets."  [Note that as part of a Halloween special, the
   earlier quote may not count towards continuity.  Also, see "Comments"
   section for more -- Ed.]  {jg}

=  When they zoom in on Lisa, the kid behind her has brown hair ... then
   during the two middle zoom frames he has blue hair, and on the final zoom
   he has brown hair again.  {sg}

*  Why would kids in the second grade be studying fractions?  I didn't get to
   that stuff until middle school.  {jg2}

+  Why can't OFF afford lobster, and have to raise it?  In "Homer's Enemy",
   the Simpsons ate lobster for dinner (more than one, too).  {jg}

*  Lobsters aren't bright red until after they've been cooked.

*  It would take around 6 years, even with fattening from risotto and pork
   sausages, for a lobster to grow from Mr. Pinchy's initial size to his size
   at the end of the show.  Especially considering his several traumatic near-
   death experiences in which he was out of the water for an extended period
   of time.  {ck}

-  In the close up, the phone has nine buttons.  In the far shots, it has the
   usual twelve.

*  The Learning Channel probably wouldn't be airing the shark show Lisa's
   watching early in the morning.  [See "Comments" section for more]  {ec}

=  Lisa's slippers mysteriously appeared when Ralph appeared, then disappeared
   again when Ralph left.  {ddg}

=  Lewis' skin is yellow at the end of Act 1.  {ss}

+  And, he appears to be in Lisa's class.  {ak}

=  Speaking of goofs pertaining to minor characters in Bart's class, Wendell
   has brown hair when he walks by.  {ak}

=  When they zoom in on the children taking the test, everyone has a paper,
   except some girl near the back, who is writing vigorously anyway.  {tmh}

*  If Bart knows that Nelson has all the exams, then how come *he* doesn't use
   them?  [Andrew Gill responds, "Money?  Or maybe he can't follow the crib
   sheet?  Or maybe Mrs. Krabapple is too cynical to use the same test every
   year."]  {mp}

*  For that matter, why doesn't Nelson?  {mp}

*  What happened to the fish when Pinchy became a free-range lobster?  {mar}

+  Nelson is never in Mrs. Krabappel's class [In this episode, anyway -- Ed.]
   (Must have a dummy of himself too).  {af}

c  After Pinchy pinches Marge's nose, she says "Son of a ...", while the
   captions read "That little ..."  {mar}

c  Bart says "What the hell happened to my stupid lobster?", while the
   captions read "What the heck happened to my dead lobster?"  {mar}

+  Skinner's scoreboard control didn't appear until after he said he had
   purchased the scoreboard.  {brk}

+  When Lisa said only she and Skinner knew about her cheating, she forgot
   that Willie knew about it as well ... ["And Bart and Nelson," writes Andrew
   Gill.  "And Lisa ..."]  {jr2}

+  Milhouse and Nelson are playing Tetherball, skipping Mrs. Krabappel's
   class.  {af}

*  All of Otto's hair couldn't POSSIBLY have fit under that tiny mask!  {tmh}

*  How come Bart's likeness of himself is so realistic, while his likeness of
   Lisa is so fake looking?  [{je} figures, "Because he had forever to plan
   the construction of his own dummy.  The need for a Lisa dummy was brought
   up at the last second."]  {mar}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  A fine Lisa episode, with a good moral dilemma.
   Unfortunately, the dilemma was undercut of the conclusion of the main plot.
   Still, an enjoyable episode, arguably the best of the season so far.  With
   episodes like this, Ian Maxtone-Graham could make himself a fan favorite
   (as long as he doesn't insult us in print).  (A-)

Brad Bizzolt:  If this episode had been posted to this newsgroup instead of
   aired on national TV tonite, I probably would've followed up with something
   like, "It's not bad, but just doesn't quite feel right."  It's amazing how
   OFF could all be out of character in so many different ways at once ...
   fortunately, the peripheral characters saved this from the 'barely
   memorable' tag.  The opening of Act 3, Ralph in general ("SuperNintendo
   Chalmers" was a stroke of genius), Nelson as bookie, the Oscar Meyer
   periodic table, and the tether-cinder were riotously funny, but past that
   ... meh.  No real message to speak of, everything moved too quickly with a
   vague non-sequitur resolution, etc. Maybe I should put more stock into what
   people say about Mr. Maxtone-Graham.  (B)

Ben Collins:  I can't believe this.  This isn't supposed to happen.  The one I
   call Ian Haxtone-Graham isn't supposed to write good episodes, or
   characterize Lisa so well, or make Homer even remotely likeable.  But it's
   happened.  Maxtone-Graham avoids the "Principal and the Lisa" pitfall I
   feared by giving her the moral dilemma she would actually have in this
   situation, and giving us some classic social commentary on the cheapening
   of American education.  I even enjoyed the cute, funny subplot with Homer's
   lobster.  But, as we've seen all too often this season, some gags run too
   long and the story could have progressed a little more evenly.  All in all,
   a successful episode and the best of Season 10 so far.  (A-)

Nathan DeHoff:  Ian Maxtone-Graham continues with his tradition of weak plots
   with amusing jokes.  While the premise of Lisa cheating on a test was not
   entirely unbelievable, the way in which it happened was fairly ridiculous.
   Lisa's dilemma on whether or not to reveal the fact that she cheated was
   fine the first time, but she faced that same dilemma too many times.
   Really, there was not much development of the plot at all.  It was pretty
   funny, though.  As for the subplot, the idea of Homer getting attached to
   the lobster that he intended to eat was clever, if odd.  My favorite parts
   of the episode included the grocery store scene and Ralph's appearances.
   Overall, while far from the best-plotted episode, it was an entertaining
   way to spend a half hour (aside from the commercials).  (B-)

Anthony Dean:  More than a few hours after the episode aired, I'm still
   wondering what the point of this episode was (cheating's OK if it helps out
   in the long run? Lisa shouldn't care how well she does since she's
   surrounded by idiots? Don't give lobsters warm baths for too long?).  The
   portrayals of some of the people involved in this episode (Lisa, Marge)
   felt a bit out of character to me.  The comptroller ending was, as I
   feared, was quite stupid, along with the drawn-out-too-long lobster part of
   the ending.  The most amusing moment of this episode was probably the
   "school was moved from Missouri/where is Springfield?" joke.  (C-)

Yuri Dieujuste:  I honestly thought that this was a standard episode.  The
   episode was very enjoyable, but I did not laugh out loud.  The Dash Dingo
   sketch was pretty good.  The story line was well written and was very good.
   Homer's plot fit perfectly into Lisa's plot.  (C+)

Jordan Eisenberg:  This was probably the funniest non-Halloween, non-holdover
   episode of the past two seasons.  After the first act, in which most of
   last season's episodes had all their humor heavily concentrated, I expected
   it to slow down and get slow and bizarre (as the trend has been), but it
   just got better and more involving. Humor wasn't the only department that
   "Lisa Gets an A" excels in either: the plot was a natural combination of
   character motivation and Simpson-esque zaniness.  Characterization was
   dead-on, and this is Ian Maxtone-Graham we're talking about!  Even the
   animation was above-par.  So far, we've seen two "normal" AABF's:  One
   mediocre, and one superb.  If they can make two out of three, my doubts
   about the series will truly be put to rest.  (A+)

Alex Foley:  The best of Season 10 (so far) and the best Ian-Maxtone Graham
   written episode yet.  Lisa's moral dilemma is well handled (and funny as
   well), and the Homer sub-plot also worked well (Pinchy was so funny!).
   "Lisa Gets an A" gets a deserved -- What else?  ;)  (A)

Andrew Gill:  This was a solid episode.  The characterization of Lisa could be
   worse--I don't think that she's a grade-aholic, as we see in this episode.
   She probably wouldn't have stayed home for all of those days, but it's a
   much better Lisa than we've seen in years.  The Homer subplot was pretty
   pointless, but at least I didn't find it annoying. If this is the general
   trend of the show, I'm not too worried about a season 12.  (B)

Joe Green:  I was expecting a rehash of "Lard of the Dance" (unfunny
   preachiness from Lisa juxtaposed with contrived wackiness from Homer) but
   was pleasantly surprised. The commentary on how schools are preoccupied
   with money and then blow on stuff kids don't benefit from was right on
   target.  (B+)

Joe Klemm:  The main plot, despite the scoreboard bit,  is again yet another
   story in which Lisa's political views caused some trouble.  This could
   easily be avoided in later seasons if they can cause Lisa go to a special
   school away from home.  As for Homer, it was clever to have him keep a
   lobster as a pet.  In other words: drop the political Lisa stories, keep
   the comical Homer stories.  (B-)

Haynes Lee:  Both the plots were good and held their own but both their
   endings were abrupt if not disturbing. Was there supposed to be a moral
   somewhere?  (B)

Brian Rawson-Ketchum:  Now this episode I'm glad to say I've enjoyed.  The
   jokes were plentiful, Homer wasn't being a jerk (the guy remembered Lisa's
   a vegetarian, for crying out loud), and Lisa played quite a memorable role.
   The lobster subplot had quite a few good gags, a good subplot we've needed
   all season.  Overall, this episode gets a well deserved A, even if it was
   written by that Maxtone-Graham guy.  I can honestly say it was *his* best
   work so far.  (A)

Jeremy Reaban:  I really, really liked this episode.  First of all, and most
   importantly, it was funny.  Lots of weird gags, like Dash Dingo (the object
   of the game is to eat 7 crystal dingo babies), Willie cleaning the toilet,
   the tank scene, and the ending was fantastic!  But mostly, what I liked, is
   that it portrayed Lisa as a kid, not as a little adult.  That doesn't
   happen very often - usually she's portrayed as an annoying PC thug, or as
   the aforementioned adult, or whatever, not as what she is, a little girl
   whose very smart and moral  (A+)

Abhi Rey:  After Graham's mediocre Homer eps of last year, it was surprising
   that he could pull off a good Lisa episode.  The episode had jokes that
   weren't exactly subtle, but still clever (Crash Bandicoot parody,
   Supernintendo Chalmers, Homer taking all the samples, Willy, the Where is
   Springfield? gag, and the ending with Homer crying while eating the
   lobster).  I think Lisa's actions were believable (her addiction to the
   video game, her decision to cheat).  What pulls this episode from a higher
   B+ rating was the lousy ending, which was almost as bad as The Principal
   and the Pauper.  People say that the plot was good, but there could have
   been a bit more done with the storyline, but too much was crammed into the
   3rd act.  8/10  (B)

Tom Rinschler:  "Lisa Gets and A" doesn't quite get an "A" (or an A+++
   either).  However, it wasn't a bad episode at all, IMHO.  The plot and
   sub-plot were well integrated for once, and for the most part
   characterization was well on (Homer and Bart both had clever ideas:
   Raising a lobster to pay less, and the "fake Bart" sitting in the
   classroom).  I'm sure all of us had a good shock and laugh when Chalmers
   said "Missouri"!  And everything rapped up in a manner satisfactory to all
   (other than the poor lobster of course ...)  (B+)

Matt Rose:  The Simpsons seems to be slowly deteriorating into "The Wacky
   Homer Simpson and family show".  Even in an episode based around Lisa, it's
   still "look at Homer.  Look at what he's doing.  See what he's gotten into
   now".  Terrible subplot and terrible ending.  I want Ian Maxtone-Graham
   fired tomorrow!  So what's good about the episode?  Well, Lisa of course.
   Sadly, Lisa's the only reason why I still watch this show.  Ralph being
   Ralph, Skinner being Skinner, and some great Ben & Jerry's ice cream
   flavors also made the episode palatable.  Sorry Yeardley, but this episode
   didn't "Rock my world."  (C)

Jason Rosenbaum:  This episode was above average.  It was a plot driven
   episode, didn't have much humor.  Thankfully, the plot was really good, and
   the first act was hilarious.  I love when the Simpsons make fun of video
   games (Donkey Kong in The Springfield Files, the characters circling around
   Bart's head in Marge Not Be Proud) and this one was no exception.  I didn't
   care much for the Homer subplot, it got stupid after awhile.  The ending
   totally sucked.  It was very rushed and wasn't funny.  Otherwise, a decent
   ep.  (B-)

Aaron Varhola:  It didn't "rock my world" (in the words of Yeardley Smith) as
   much as 8F15, but it did explore Lisa rather well.  Lisa's compulsiveness
   and wanting to avoid embarrassment triumphed over her honesty and work
   ethic for once, but she couldn't enjoy her ill-gotten gains, even if it
   would help others.  The sub-plot was silly, but it didn't spill much into
   the main plot.  Ian Maxtone-Graham shows Lisa to be a good, but flawed
   person who does something dishonest, but her conscience makes her feel
   worse than even if she was caught.  (A-)

Brad Wardell:  Well, for me the funniest parts were the parts with Homer and
   the lobster. And the ending ... I was just totally cracked up by the ending
   with Homer crying, yet eating, his friend.  The Lisa stuff was take it or
   leave it overall but a few hilarious lines in there did it (the daydream
   with Auto having tenure at Brown and Groundskeeper Willy with his hand down
   a toilet) for me.  (A-)

Yours Truly:  Looks like Yeardley's reputation as an episode critic is safe
   for now -- this show was a surprisingly good examination of a momentary
   lapse in Lisa's ethics.  In fact, controversial Maxtone-Graham may be
   better off writing the show's children than the adults.  Lisa's "Dash
   Dingo" habit and the plot's surprise ending were also great.  A subplot
   where Homer raises a lobster isn't bad, but is outshined by the rest of the
   episode.  "Lisa Gets and A" gets an A- from me.  (A-)

AVERAGE GRADE:  B+ (3.26)   Std Dev.: 0.7500   (29 reviews computed)

==============================================================================
>> The Frugal Gourmet

Aaron Varhola gives Homer a suggestion:  If Homer wants to get another free
   meal, he should try the food court in Pioneer Place mall in downtown
   Portland.  The vendors there are *very* aggressive in giving out free
   samples, although they might expect you to buy something.  :)


Galloping gourmet Ondre Lombard discusses real-life versions of Eatie
   Gourmets:  The health food store was depicted rather accurately, aside from
   the cereals. More often than not, the cereals are more pleasant than
   "Alfalfa Bits," though the exaggeration for parody is amusing.  I should
   know since, being primarily vegetarian, I know of these stores.  There are
   a lot of things to sample, as well, incidentally.


>> Frozen Stiff:  Dead Celebrities as Ice Cream Flavors

Mark Aaron Richey talks about Ken & Harry's Ice Cream:  A few years ago, ice
   cream makers Ben and Jerry decided to honor their favorite band, the
   Grateful Dead, by naming a flavor after the band's (now late) leader, Jerry
   Garcia.  That flavor, Cherry Garcia, is now one of the most popular B&J
   flavor, and the most famous.  I guess they decided to name other flavors
   after people :)

   Milli Vanilla -- Milli Vanilli, a German twosome (Rob Pilatus & Fab Morvan)
   who had a string of hit songs in the early 90's ... until it was reveled
   that they had lip-synced on all their albums.  Attempts to resurrect their
   musical career by actually singing didn't meet with success, and
   tragically, Pilatus died earlier this year.

   Desmond Tutti-Frutti -- Desmond Tutu, archbishop of South Africa, Nobel
   Peace Prize winner, and outspoken opponent of apartheid (the Catholic
   church gave it's own none-to-subtle opinion on the subject by appointing
   the black Tutu as archbishop in the first place)

   [Ben Collins writes, "I could be wrong, but I think Tutu is Anglican,
   considering that the Anglican church also has the title of "archbishop,"
   and that South Africa, being a remnant of the British Empire, has far more
   Anglicans than Catholics."]

   Honey Bono -- Sonny Bono, former pop singer (with ex-wife Cher), who became
   a Republican congressman in 1992.  Died earlier this year in a skiing
   accident.

   [Ben Collins writes, "Although Sonny ran in 1992, he won his seat in 1994,
   during the great Republican sweep  (I mean great as in large, not good).
   ;)"  To this, Eric Sansoni responds, "Great meaning large or immense, he
   uses it in the pejorative sense."]

   Candy Warhol -- Andy Warhol, eccentric pop artist.  Responsible for the
   Campbell Soup painting, and the phrase "Everyone is famous for 15 minutes".

   Xavier Nugat -- Xavier Cugat, Spanish composer and bandleader

   Sherbert Hoover -- Herbert Hoover, 31st President of the United States.


>> "But I'm hardly learning at all!"

Andrew Gill:  Lisa is certainly right about not learning anything watching TLC
   and its arch-rival, the Discovery Channel.  It's mostly pop-science mixed
   in with a bit of pseudoscience.  The PBS documentaries are much better. For
   example, today, I saw something on TLC about Quantum Mechanics hosted by
   Quark and Mrs. Isaac (Newton's mother) that claimed that Einstein virtually
   created Quantum Mechanics (in real life, he hated it).  I'm still waiting
   for a program based on the journal of the Proceedings of the National
   Academy of Sciences.

   Of course, they also have a very interesting daytime schedule: about 50
   airings of Great Chefs, Great Cities, interspersed with Interior Motives
   and 20 Fixit shows ("This is a two-hammer project ...")


Ellen Cohen elaborates on TLC's schedule:  Lisa is actually watching an
   educational program about sharks on The Learning Channel during the day,
   when anyone who's seen TLC knows the programming is something like this

   Early morning:  Young children's programming

   Late morning/mid afternoon:  "Dream Weddings", "Dream Vacations", gardening
   tips, etc.

   Late afternoon till 8 PM Eastern Time:  Home improvement shows

   8 PM to 3 AM:  The kind of shows Lisa would want to watch ... unless
   they're doing "Life in the ER" or "Medical Detectives" or "Alien
   Abductions" or something cool about volcanos!


>> OFF with cable?

Speaking of The Learning Channel, Anthony Dean wonders:  Does OFF do have
   cable or not?  It seems the last few seasons (or at least starting with
   "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds") seem to suggest they "can finally afford
   it" (to paraphrase from that hilarious second-season cable-stealing
   episode).


>> Next on "20/20," the new "rock-and-roll" fad.

Benjamin Robinson:  Hugh Downs has a long career in network news to his
   credit.  Currently, he's one of the anchors on ABC's "20/20".  Mr. Downs
   comes across as warm and avuncular, but not that hip, which might explain
   why kids enjoying videogames comes as news to him.  ("Hipness," of course
   is not a mandatory requirement for a network news anchor.)


>> That's a strange name.  I would've called him "Lakitu-Koopowser Luigiamo!"

Jordan Eisenberg:  Entering its third installment this month [November, 1998],
   the "Crash Bandicoot" series was Sony's answer to Nintendo's Mario and
   Sega's Sonic as a mascot to hype its hardware with.  Meeting the public
   with less-than-spectacular enthusiasm (but still selling rather well),
   Crash was soon left in the shadow of Lara Croft and her "Tomb Raider"
   franchise to mascot the Playstation (ignoring the fact that "Tomb Raider"
   was released on many other platforms too).

   "Dash Dingo" is a hilarious parody of the games, as the floating head of
   Dr. Neo-Cortex is replaced by his supposedly evil Australian counterpart,
   and the goal of "Crash," to collect the seven crystals, was altered to
   "find and devour the seven crystal babies."  I don't recall any nunchucks,
   though.

   Some other similarities

   - The logo is a dead ringer, with the star's name in big yellow letters,
   above the species name in red mounted on a wooden board.

   - Dash does a forward flip onto the screen, a move that "Crash" players get
   used to seeing after a while.

   - Alf Clausen did a good job vaguely replicating the music, while giving it
   an Australian slant no less.

   - When Lisa pauses the game to talk to Marge, the screen shows Dash Dingo
   running from a polar bear.  This mimics two similar levels in the series:
   one where Crash runs from a huge boulder ala Indiana Jones, and one in
   which he rides a baby polar bear through an obstacle course.

   - Speaking of the pause screen, the font of the word "Pause" was nearly
   perfect.

   - The machine itself looks just like a Playstation, only it's a darker
   shade of grey, and the controller has two directional pads (the action
   buttons on the real PSX do look vaguely similar to a directional pad,
   though, so it may just be the sloppy drawing).  Aside from the controller,
   the darkish case makes it look a bit like Sega's upcoming "Dreamcast"
   console.


Believe it or not, that's more.  Joe Klemm adds a few things:  Dash Dingo is a
   dead on spoof of Crash Bandicoot, a hit series of Playstation games about a
   bandicoot who tries to save the world from a mad scientist.  It is produced
   by Sony, and created by Universal Interactive.  This is probably a good
   game to spoof as the game Lisa plays since she is kind of similar to
   Crash's sister, Coco.


>> Lisa the video queen

Would Lisa get hooked on video games?  Aaron Varhola thinks so:  I liked
   seeing Lisa get into the video game.  We've seen Lisa in compulsive mode
   before [9F12]; even though Lisa doesn't normally play video games, I could
   see how an adventure game could captivate her; it would spark some of her
   creativity to figure out how to complete the levels.


>> The Wind in the What?

It's too late to help Lisa, but David Brunt explains the plot of "The Wind in
   the Willows":  The main story (which is very fragmented and has many sub-
   plots), has the idle rich Toad becoming bored with his life and looking for
   means of excitement -- fast cars being his chosen method. Coupled to this
   is his need to save his manor house from the villainous Weasels.  It's all
   basically an allegory of money not finding you happiness, and those who
   have it are either stupid (Toad) or crooks (the Weasels).  Mole, Rat and
   Badger are the central sympathetic characters.

   The story is perhaps better known for the 1949 Disney animated adaptation
   as part of "Ichabod and Mr. Toad" (which appeared quite frequently on "The
   Wonderful World of Disney" TV series) or Terry Jones' celebrity cast
   version of 1996.


Benjamin Robinson adds:  Kenneth Grahame wrote and Ernest H. Shepard
   illustrated the book, which is now considered a classic of children's
   literature.


>> Opening Harvard's doors

Aaron Varhola:  What'll get you into Harvard?  Who knows.  Someone I knew took
   summer classes at Harvard after his junior year of high school, got an A in
   both classes he took, and still got turned down.  Unless Harvard gives Lisa
   tons of points for coming out of "America's Crudbucket", it's still a
   crapshoot if she'll get in there.  I still think she'd be better off at the
   University of Chicago, where she can play in the blues clubs of the South
   Side in addition to getting one of the best liberal arts educations around.
   (Heh ... and I assure you that my graduating from the U of C had *nothing*
   to do with that comment ...).


>> Testing, testing ...

Haynes Lee:  Mrs. Krabappel in [3F04] "Treehouse of Horror VI" incorrectly
   told students before aptitude test, "Don't kill yourself.  The more poorly
   you do the more state funding this school gets".

   It's the other way around.  A school gets more funding for better test
   scores.  This episode takes the correct approach.  There have been schools
   where teachers have been caught giving the students the answers ahead of
   time.  Also, there has also been cases of students blackmailing their
   principals if they don't get certain concessions they will tank their
   aptitude tests and the school receives less funding.  Lisa was already
   involved in similar scandal in [8F15] "Separate Vocations" where she stole
   all the teacher edition text books.  Some of these tests use the same
   questions as the year before.  However, some teachers caught telling their
   students this had their teaching licenses summarily revoked.


The following is a Haynes Lee Urban Legend Alert.  Had this been an actual
   urban legend, you would have been advised to stay tuned to this station for
   further instructions:  Lisa correctly answering the the missing question
   (or the one which had the typo?) is similar to  the false/unverifiable
   urban legend on how cheaters  are caught.

   Fb.  Prof. nails exam thief by cutting bottom 0.5" of exam to find longer
   answer.

   http://snopes.simplenet.com/college/exam/stolen.htm

   A student stops by the office of one of his instructors to ask a question
   and finds that the professor has stepped out for a moment, leaving an
   unguarded stack of the next day's final examinations on his desk.  The
   student quickly steals one of the exams and disappears.  Before issuing the
   exam, however, the professor counts them and notices that one is missing.
   He cuts one half-inch off the bottom of every exam prior to distributing
   them to the class, then fails the student who turns in a test paper longer
   than the rest.


Meanwhile, Aaron Varhola ponders an interesting question:  Who made up those
   cheat sheets, anyway?  I don't think Martin or the Superfriends would have
   stooped to such chicanery, although Nelson and his friends might have been
   able to extract some of the tests as tribute.


>> Lisa the PC thug

In the DYN section, Joe Green noticed:  Lisa doesn't seem upset about Homer
   wanting to eat a lobster?


Paul Tomko theorized:  In fact she likes the smell of it.  I guess she's just
   a little girl after all and even though she attempts to stifle herself to
   be PC, she still in the end, yearns to do what she really wants.  I think
   when she grows up she won't remain a vegetarian.  She'll see that it is
   stupid to promote the PC agenda and just do what she wants.


Benjamin Robinson responded:  Lisa =does= do what she really wants!  The path
   of least resistance for her would be to cave in to the pressures of the
   outside world, to eat that lobster, to blow off that museum, to bury
   herself to gain the approval of her shallow peers.  Following her own path
   may cost her, but Lisa is not stifling herself.

   Don't be so quick to equate vegetarianism with "PC" attitudes, either.
   Strictly speaking, "political correctness" is a system of beliefs aimed at
   ensuring that nobody says, does, or even thinks anything that may give
   offense to someone else.  The basic idea is good (part of being polite is
   not deliberately offending people), but the PC minions carried it way too
   far, sacrificing freedom and honesty on the altar of inoffensiveness.

   Anyway, there are plenty of vegetarians (or so I assume; I'm not among
   their ranks) who feel eating meat is morally wrong, not because it might
   marginalize someone's animal companion, but because they feel it's wrong to
   take a sentient life, period.  It's no more PC than being a conscientious
   objector, or entering the priesthood; it's just a moral decision that some
   people make.  If anything, taking a stand is the opposite of PC, where
   holding an opinion is itself suspect.


>> Lisa's ethics

Dan Tropea:  Lisa's dilemma was interesting.  Her cheating helped others and
   by telling the truth could have hurt more people then by her continued lie.
   I think that maybe she should have applied to this what she said about
   Jebediah that the truth does more harm then good.


Andrew Gill responds:  Meh.  It's different to take a long-dead historical
   figure with a sordid past and forbear from defaming him on his day.  Lisa
   was wrong, and dishonest money was coming to Springfield.  If I were her
   (and I wouldn't be--for how many reasons), I'd have done the same thing in
   the end.


>> Keeping score

A scoreboard for elementary school students?  It can happen, says Paul Tomko:
   When I played basketball in elementary school, not only did my school have
   a scoreboard, but all the schools we played against also had them.  But
   they were simple boards, with just the score, who had possession, the time,
   the quarter and that sort of thing.  No amusing graphics.


Don Del Grande adds:  Most schools get their scoreboards free from either
   Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola in exchange for exclusivity in the school's vending
   machines and concession sales (and probably cafeterias as well).


>> We're still better off than the school with the Bolognium

Mark Poyser puts his chemistry knowledge to good use:  The Oscar Mayer
   promotional periodic table of the elements was correct with the following
   exceptions

   Groups 12-18 [IIB - VIII or 0 (old style)] are omitted -- in other words,
   those to the left of the column containing:  Cu (copper), Ag (silver),Au
   (gold) -- group 11  [IB (old style)]  That leaves out plenty.  No carbon,
   oxygen, silicon.

   Bo -- Bolognium* is now element 42 [5 down,6 across], replacing Molybdenum,
   meaning the atomic weight is somewhere around 95, not "delicious," nor
   "snack-tacular."

   Mo -- Molybdenum is now element 89 [7 down, 3 across], replacing Actinium.

   We -- Wienerium* (?) is now element 57 [6 down, 3 across], replacing
   Lanthanum.

   *not real elements, by the way

   No Lanthanide or Actinide series.

   There was no correlation between the colors in the chart (blue, pink, and
   yellow) and any physical property (solid/liquid/gas, radioactive,
   acid/base, allotropic form [crystal structure]).


Jeremy Reaban adds:  "Bolonium" or "Bolognium" (Bo) apparently replaces.
   Radium, near the end of the table.  Some of the table is correct, but a lot
   of it is jumbled up - in the wrong order.  Or so it looks like, I don't
   have a real one handy.  It also seems to be missing one column (all the way
   to the right), although it's hard to tell because Mrs. Krabappel is in the
   way.


>> We're still better off than the school with the Intellivision

Benjamin Robinson:  Today, Coleco is perhaps best remembered as a manufacturer
   of children's toys, including the improbably popular Cabbage Patch Dolls.
   Around 1982, however, Coleco was also a maker of personal computers.  The
   ball got rolling with ColecoVision, a videogame machine which was the
   early-Eighties version of the Nintendo 64.  At the time, inexpensive (even
   by today's standards) personal computers were beginning to catch on with
   home consumers.  Coleco decided it wanted in on the action, and leveraged
   the respect in generated from ColecoVision to launch the Coleco Adam.  Adam
   was promoted as being compatible with the Apple II, then the gold standard
   of home computers, but costing hundreds of dollars less.  (Apple II
   computers retailed for $1,500 - $2,000 back then.)  In addition, they would
   also throw in a daisy-wheel printer, the only choice for letter-quality
   output in the pre-laser printer days, for free.  Adam was available in two
   versions, a standalone unit, and a rarely-seen expansion pack for the
   ColecoVision.

   Unfortunately for Coleco, Adam tanked in the marketplace.  Consumers may
   have noticed that the machine didn't quite live up to its hype.  The
   company almost immediately backpedaled on its Apple-compatibility promise,
   since the Adam's processor and storage media were completely different than
   Apple's equipment.  In addition, there were rumored reliability problems.
   But the biggest problem was that the whole home-computer market was going
   south.  Manufacturers chased the more lucrative office market, which
   ultimately adapted the IBM PC platform as the de facto hardware standard.
   The push for a computer in every home didn't restart in earnest until the
   mid-Nineties, when the internet gave families a justification for a
   computer purchase.

   What does all this have to do with "The Simpsons"?  Um, probably not much,
   except that the computer we see doesn't look at all like a Coleco Adam.  It
   resembles the Commodore PET, which was another early home computer.  But
   that's a story for another episode capsule.


Joe Klemm writes about the Coleco's immediate predecessor:  Coleco was one of
   many home video game systems released in the early 1980's. Despite graphics
   similar to arcade games, as well as the licensing of Cabbage Patch Kids and
   Smurfs, Coleco fell victim to the video game crash of the mid 1980's,
   though it did release some games for the Atari 2600, which was the most
   successful system in the 1980's video game systems.


Tom Whelton:  Coleco-Vision died out because the parent company didn't know
   how to handle electronic products well.  (Coleco of course made everything
   from toys to above ground pools.)


Jeremy Reaban gives us some information about modern video games:  Sony
   Playstation -- Probably the most popular video game system today.  It's an
   almost exact animated reproduction of it - down to the weirdly shaped
   controllers (although they look like one of the 3rd party controllers, as
   opposed to the standard ones).

   Super Nintendo -- What Ralph calls the superintendent, used to be the big
   video game system.  Nintendo's follow up to this, the N64, is fairly
   popular in the US, but very unpopular in Japan ....


By the way, if you remember Bart having a different console in "Marge Be Not
   Proud (3F07)," you're right.  Jeremy Reaban writes:  Curiously enough, the
   game system Bart had back then looked remarkably like a Sega Saturn
   (although the one Bart had played cartridges, not CDs like the Saturn).
   The Saturn is pretty much dead, these days (in the USA), so it makes sense
   Bart now owns a Playstation ...


>> The writing quality debate continues

Michael K. Neylon suspects the writers might be taking the term Lisa-centric
   too literally:  While I think the episode was OK for a Lisa episode
   (definitely nothing like Lisa's Sub or Lisa the Greek), the one major
   problem that I had with the episode is everyone else involved in the Lisa
   plot. Lisa was characterized fine, but everyone else around her seemed
   either out of character, or too forced.  (Note that many recent Lisa eps in
   past seasons have had this same problem).  For example, I don't see how
   Marge would accept Lisa's final decision without any moral recourse, and
   Bart was almost neglected in this plot (a missed opportunity, instead
   wasted on the scoreboard gags).  It seems the writers have problems trying
   to combine Lisa with any other character, as she's the closest to reality
   compared to the others.  All the recent Lisa eps have mostly been Lisa
   struggling *by herself* with a personal problem, with the rest of the cast
   only supporting her gags.  Compare this to Lisa's Sub or Lisa the Greek,
   where the interaction with another character only strengthens Lisa's
   personality more.

   I think that the writers need to consider that Lisa-only Lisa centric
   episodes are hard to be unique anymore, and instead, they need to ponder
   Lisa and someone else.  I'm still waiting for a good Lisa/Marge episode, or
   a new Lisa/Homer plot.  We've explored enough of her inner character to the
   point of exhaustion ... but Lisa is a different person when she interacts,
   and that hasn't been explored enough IMO on the series yet.


Mick Decosta presents the other side of the debate:  I think when watching the
   Simpsons, we would all enjoy it more if we concentrated on the jokes rather
   than plot devices, character development etc, etc.  If you want compelling
   plot you should maybe watch NYPD Blue or Masterpiece Theater.  Last night's
   episode IMO was top ten of all time material.  Sure a finely crafted plot
   might of enhanced the experience, but the jokes were so tightly packed into
   that episode that I could hardly recover from one to the other.
   Supernintendo Chalmers, the Coleco computer, the fake Bart, Willie cleaning
   the toilet, the scoreboard, "most dilapidated school in Missouri", Captain
   McAllister begging for spare change, the fake comptroller, the list  goes
   on and on ...  If you want good plots and warm underlying messages, pick up
   some tapes of the first and second seasons.  I personally find them
   painfully unfunny to watch now, but different strokes I guess ...


Eric Sansoni also liked the show:  Tonight's ep was a pure joy, partly because
   I felt like I was spending time with the Simpsons I know and love again.
   Homer was a penny-pincher and a pig, yet with the same lovable, forgiving
   heart that had him accepting SLH into the family way back when.  Bart was
   once again an ambitious prankster who never plays by the rules.  Marge had
   less to do I guess, but I did like her wanting to cook the lobster.
   Remember her butcher-chopping scenes in Lisa the Veg? Marge has a practical
   side, and as the sweet mother type, she's used to hacking up a lot of raw
   meat.  I liked her being apprehensive about the ugly pet's creepiness, and
   her embarrassment and denial over Lisa's cheating showed real insight into
   the way the typical mom would behave.  As far as Lisa, I don't consider
   developing a character and giving her greater depth and realism to be out-
   of-character, no matter how much this group tends to go for that theory.
   [Actually, most posters on a.t.s. like Lisa's characterization in this
   episode - Ed.]


>> More Animation Quality Nitpicking

Anthony Dean:  Yes, I'm harping on the drop in the show's animation quality
   yet again.  The end scene with Homer eating the lobster looked rather
   crudely drawn (and the colors used for the backgrounds, etc. looked rather
   dulled/fewer in variety used).  Maybe my comment that they should either
   use "Animaniacs" animators or go back to Klasky-Csupo wasn't pointless (a
   Tokyo Movie Shinsa animated "Simpsons" would probably be lovely to look at,
   though I don't believe Startoons would be an appropriate studio [unless we
   want to see the characters moving in a manner involving lots of eye-
   movement expressions or arm/wrist movement, though at least it wouldn't be
   in a rather mechanically-drawn fashion].  K-C would be an improvement as
   well, though I imagine they're probably focused mainly on "Rugrats" at this
   point).


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  As Good As Lisa Gets


Alex Foley:  Hmm ... shouldn't it be Lisa Gets an A+++?  ;)


Anthony Dean:  Apparently, the money gained from (apparently briefly) turning
   SES into a state prison branch in [2F19] didn't last long.


Ondre Lombard:  Interesting how Lisa's initial disdain for the dingo video
   game eventually turned into an obsession.  Makes me wonder if Bonestorm
   ["Marge Be Not Proud (3F07)"] would've grew on her if she'd have played it
   long enough.


Jeff Pack [on Brown's reaction to Lisa's daymare]:  None of us said "ouch"; we
   were all laughing our asses off.  (Except for this guy in the BDH editorial
   cartoon; check it out at
   <http://www.netspace.org/herald/issues/112498/tag1.f.html>.


Benjamin Robinson:  Anti-goof -- the fourth "+" on Lisa's paper actually is
   drawn in a different (and slightly darker) color.  So are the lines turning
   Ralph's "F" into a "B".

% Skinner tries to absorb the news.

Skinner:  You cheated?  Oh, lordy-lordy-lordy.  Why didn't Ms. Hoover
          tell me?
Lisa:     She doesn't know.  You're the only one I've told.
Skinner:  Well, then, one could make the argument ... that ... there
          really is no ... problem!
Lisa:     But what I did was wrong!
Skinner:  Oh, very much so, but as long as we handle this in a mature
          and, above all, quiet manner, we'll still get that grant
          money.  [laughs]  Oh, you really scared me, there.
Lisa:     But we can't accept that money.  It's tainted!
Skinner:  Now, now, leave the money out of this!  It's not the money's
          fault you cheated.  Besides, I've already started spending
          it.  Check out this new scoreboard.
          [we see a scoreboard standing up against the side wall of his
          office, where he plays "charge!" accompanied by some flashy
          animations]
          Heh-heh, I'm still learning all the buttons.
Lisa:     Well, if you're gonna cover this up, I'll just have to go
          over your head to Super ...
          [Skinner presses another button on his scoreboard]
          ... intendant ...
          [and another]
          ... Chalmers!
          [and one more]
-- "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% As if on cue, Chalmers walks into the office.

Chalmers:      Skinner!!!  I am outraged that you kept this from me!
               You were supposed to call as soon as the new scoreboard
               was in.  Tell me, does it play that song "charge?"
Skinner:       Oh, does it ever!
Lisa:          You can't keep this scoreboard because there's not gonna
               =be= any grant money ... because ... =I= cheated!
Chalmers:      [pauses]  Lisa, let's take a walk.
               [he and Skinner go over to Lisa]
               A little traveling music, Seymour?
               [Skinner plays "charge" on his scoreboard as they leave
               the room]
-- "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% The three of them walk over to a classroom window.  It's missing,
% save for a few shards of glass protruding from the frame.  Chalmers
% smashes one of them with his fist.

Chalmers:      Good lord, what a dump.  It's not surprising this school
               was once classified =the= most dilapidated in all of
               Missouri.
               [Lisa and Skinner look at each other quizzically]
               ... that's why it was shut down and moved here, brick by
               brick.
Skinner:       Look around, Lisa.  That grant money could do a lot of
               good.
Chalmers:      Don't you think those youngsters deserve a regulation
               tetherball?
               [the scene switches to Milhouse and Nelson playing
               tetherball, only the ball is really a cinderblock, and
               what it's tethered to is less of a pole and more of a
               thin, crooked piece of metal.  Nelson hits the 'ball',
               which swings around and hits Milhouse in the face,
               breaking his glasses]
Skinner:       We can buy =real= periodic tables instead of these
               promotional ones from Oscar Meyer.
Krabappel:     Who can tell me the atomic weight of bolognium?
Martin:        Ooh ... delicious?
Krabappel:     Correct.  I would also accept snacktacular.
Skinner:       And, for the first time ever, our computer lab actually
               has a computer in it!
               [Ralph is sitting at their newly installed computer,
               engrossed in an educational spelling program]
Ralph:         Hi, Lisa!  Hi, Super Nintendo Chalmers!
               [he types "cat", which prompts a "meow" sound from the
               computer]
               I'm learn-ding.  [that's not a typo]
Lisa:          Aw, way to go, Ralph.
Gil:           [appearing suddenly]  D'ah, she's a beut'.  You can't
               beat a Coleco, eh ...?  How many can I put ya' down for,
               a lot?  Please say "a lot," I need this.
Skinner:       I dunno.  I'm not even sure we can keep this one.  It's
               up to Lisa.
Chalmers:      Whaddayasay, Lisa?  Will you keep our little secret for
               the good of your classmates and your school?
Gil:           And let's not forget ol' Gil, huh?  The wolf's at old
               Gil's door.
               [Lisa looks around at Skinner and Chalmers who look back
               anxiously, and at Ralph, who is happily picking his
               nose]
Lisa:          Oooh ... I guess I don't have much choice.
Gil:           Aw, thank God!  Now, let's talk rust-proofing.  These
               Colecos'll rust up on ya' like =that=, er ... shut up,
               Gil.  Close the deal ... close the deal!
-- ... and the deal is struck, "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% We leave Springfield Elementary to join Homer, Marge and Pinchy, who
% are taking a walk on the beach.

Homer:         [to Pinchy]  Relax, boy.  We're not gonna cook you!
               Enjoy your day at the beach.  Ooh, look, here's a little
               playmate for ya'.  [he picks up a snail and puts it in
               front of Pinchy, who gets bitten]  Hey!  You don't have
               to take that from no punk-ass crab!  What's wrong with
               you?  [Captain McAllister walks on]
McAllister:    Y'arr, it's not his fault he's a sissy.  =Someone's=
               been =coddling= him.
Marge:         Don't look at me!  I wanted to eat him!
McAllister:    Eh, sorry, it's usually the mother.  Eh, y-you know, I
               run a small academy for lobsters like this one.  We
               stress tough love.  Daily chores and the like.
Marge:         No!  We're not sending the lobster away to some snobby
               boarding school.
McAllister:    Y'arr, I understand.  It's hard to let go.  Eh, tell me
               this, then ... do you have any spare change?
-- "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% It's nighttime, and many people are assembled inside the auditorium
% at Springfield Elementary.  Skinner, Chalmers, Lisa and an
% unidentified man are all onstage.

Skinner:  And now, to present the grant money, a legendary figure in
          educational disbursement, state Comptroller Atkins!
          [applause]
Atkins:   Thank you.  I'm here tonight to honor the girl whose
          unprecedented test score has set a new standard in
          excellence.  Lisa?  [more applause as Lisa takes the podium]
Lisa:     Thank you.  I know this giant check is very important to
          everyone here, but ... what's even more important is the
          truth.
          [everyone looks confused, and Skinner makes "cut" guesture]
          Because, after all, education is the search for truth.
Skinner:  No, no it isn't.  Don't listen to her.  She's out of her
          mind!
Lisa:     And the truth is, we don't deserve this grant, and I don't
          deserve your applause.  I cheated on that test.
          [audience boos]
Atkins:   Wait!  How dare you condemn this girl.  Who among =you= can
          honestly say you've never cheated ... on your wives ... or
          your husbands?  What she just did took courage, and where I
          come from, Canada, we reward courage.  So I hearby decree
          that you keep the grant.  And let's give this brave girl the
          ovation she deserves!
          [everyone cheers, and OFF greets Lisa at the podium and
          carries her out of the room]
Marge:    Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.  You got the highest grade in
          the class.
Lisa:     But, Mo-om ...
Marge:    The highest grade!
-- "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% Bart slams the doors shut as they leave and throws a broom through
% the handles.  "Okay, Lisa's gone!" he shouts, and the crowd murmurs
% and returns to their seats.  The comptroller pulls off a face mask and
% is revealed to be Otto, who walks off saying "Oh, man!  Acting is
% tough!  I'll be in my trailer."

Skinner:       Ah, good old predictable Lisa.  I knew her conscience
               was a ticking time bomb.
Krabappel:     Heads up!  Here comes the =real= comptroller.
               [a few minutes later, a man similar to Otto's role, with
               a slightly different voice, is handing an oversized
               check to Skinner]
Atkins:        This grant ensures a light bulb in every classroom, and
               a high-definition TV for the teachers' lounge.
               [applause]
               Now, where's the little girl who made this grant
               possible?  Where's Lisa Simpson?
               [a poorly made dummy of Lisa pops up on a poll in the
               back of the room, which we see is being controlled by
               Bart, low in his seat.  The comptroller offers for her
               to come on up, but she shakes her head "no"]
Atkins:        Well, how about that?  Smart =and= modest!  Well, I
               should be going now.  These giant checks don't hand
               themselves out.
Skinner:       Okay, people!  Let's have a round of applause for the
               =real= comptroller!
Atkins:        Huh?
Chalmers:      [under his breath]  Idiot.
               [walks Mr. Atkins out of the room]
Skinner:       I know a liquor store where we can cash this right now!
-- "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% Lisa is at home with a marker, changing her "A+++" into the top
% horizontal line of a big, red "F."

Lisa:     That's one grade I truly earned.
Marge:    Mmmm ... who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?
Homer:    Sorry, Marge.  Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing
          birds.  But don't worry!  I put him in a nice, hot bath.
Bart:     [sniffs the air]  Hey, what smells so good?
Homer:    Yeah ... Pinchy?  Pinchy!?!  Oh ... =Pinchy=!!!!!
          [he runs out of the room worried]
-- Whoops, "Lisa Gets an 'A'"

% Later that night, Homer is crying at the dining room table, taking
% bites out of Pinchy's dead body while the family is watching.

Homer:    [eating, crying]  Oh, man, that's good.  [sob]  Pass the
          butter.
Bart:     Are you gonna eat that all by yourself?
Homer:    Uh-huh.  Pinchy would've wanted it this way.  My dear, sweet
          Pinchy.  [takes a bite]  No more pain where you are now, boy.
          [rips him in half and sucks out the meat inside]
          Oh, God, that's tasty!  I wish Pinchy were here to enjoy
          this.
          [takes more bites]  Oh, Pinchy ...
