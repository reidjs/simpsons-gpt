Couch:          The Simpsons are frogs, the living room is a pond, and the
                couch is a lily pad, and the television is still a television.
                They swim up to the pad and face the TV.  Homer uses his
                tongue to change the channel

==============================================================================

==============================================================================
   ... Handsome Pete hanging around Davey Jones' Hamper?
   ... the Duff truck passing by as the Simpsons leave the ghost town?

=  Maggie managed to squeal without moving her lips.  (She's done it with her
   pacifier in her mouth before - in "Bart the Lover" - but you could see her
   mouth open.)  {ddg}

*  Homer said he wanted to watch "Inside the Actors Studio", but it's only on
   cable TV.  (Maybe he watches through the Flanders' window?)  {ddg}

*  If anything of Grampa's was going to burst, it should have been his bladder
   rather than his kidneys.  [This was probably artistic license, but worthy
   of being included for the sake of completeness -- Ed.]

   until a donor could be found?  {bjr}

-  There is no name on the back of the boat in the first shot.  {mar}

*  Though I'm not a medical major by any means, shouldn't Homer's kidney scar
   be a bit higher up (plus, it seems highly unlikely for kidneys to simply
   burst as shown in this ep)?  {ad}

> Reviews
==============================================================================
Dale G. Abersold:  Pointless episode, no laughs ... the second coming of
   "Realty Bites" or "A Milhouse Divided"?  Very likely.  Hey, it could have
   been worse.  Still, look for the episode to appear at the bottom of my
   Best/Worst list at the end of the season.  (D)

Brad Bizzolt:  Wow, what a bizarre, disjointed, go-everywhere-but-in-
   actuality-go-nowhere plot.  While every segment had some really funny
   parts, they were all able to go on for far too long.  There were a handful
   of great one-off sight-gags, but unfortunately none of them were so
   memorable that I'm still laughing while thinking about them.  Homer's
   constant shuffling between insincerity, genuine love, and stupidity was a
   bit too bumpy a ride for me.  I have a feeling I'll enjoy this episode a
   lot more in syndication, like I did with most of Season 9's offerings, but
   for the time being, I'm a little disappointed.  The lowest grade I could
   possibly give an episode that made me laugh out loud multiple times:  (C)

Rich Bunnell:  This was simply the most disjointed episode of Simpsons that
   I've ever seen.  That isn't BAD, but the episode jumped from idea to idea
   so wildly that it didn't seem like a real episode.  It was okay up to the
   "Homer goes to the ship of lost souls" thing, when the plot just got
   utterly weird.  I nearly groaned when Homer jumped out of the operating
   table for a SECOND time, but the episode redeemed it with the car falling
   on Homer.  Also good is that even though Homer acted like a jerk in this
   episode, at least he (and other characters) realized it.  (B)

Ben Collins:  This episode is unspeakably bad.  It's not funny to see Homer
   almost kill his father through bumbling insensitivity; any attempt at humor
   based on this premise is bound to fail, and does.  Come to think of it,
   very little else about this episode is funny either.  The pointless "lost
   ship of souls" deal is a big yawner.  I'll stop ranting now ...  (D-)

Nathan DeHoff:  There are two problems that can arise in a serious sort of
   episode like this one.  A writer could center the episode around tasteless
   humor, or avoid humor entirely.  While this episode might have occasionally
   bordered on tastelessness (mostly due to Homer's selfishness), I don't
   think that it went too far, and it was certainly not without humor.  [...]
   It seems to be a case of trading one cliche for another, with the
   character-lets-love-triumph--at-the-last-minute cliche sacrificed in favor
   of the character-gets-injured-in-a-ridiculous-manner cliche.  Although
   Homer getting injured has been a bit overdone recently, I must admit that
   the car carrier gag was set up quite well. Overall, I'd say this was a
   pretty good episode.  Grade  (B+)

Anthony Dean:  Most of the jokes/plot was pretty stupid/lame (exploding
   kidneys?), but the episode didn't stir a negative reaction in me the way
   "D'oh-In in the Wind" and "When You Dish Upon a Star" did (my two least
   favorite episodes this season), and I figure the whole ghost town bit and
   the slightly morbid-yet-weird organ harvesting jokes made it worth
   watching.  (C)

Don Del Grande:  I've seen it all before; a not particularly funny concept as
   a story, Homer disgusting other people whose stories are bad enough, and
   someone realizing that family is the best thing and doing the right thing.
   Okay, so Homer chickening out the second time is new, but even I knew what
   was going to happen the minute Homer was hit by the car ...  (B)

Yuri Dieujuste:  I honestly think that this episode was well written, but it
   was not funny. The story line was fleshed out to make some sense.  I will
   expect some continuity problems because of the episode.  The ending was
   funny and but a little unrealistic.  In the real world Homer would be dead
   or seriously paralyzed.  Graphically the episode was standard Season 9-10
   animation.  (C)

Alex Foley:  What to say ... I have no idea.  I thought the Ghost Town was
   hilarious, but it all went downhill from there ... Acts 2 & 3 were
   painfully unfunny at some points, and the Kidney's exploding was just too
   unrealistic for me (this coming from a guy who has no problem with
   Murderous Itchy & Scratchy robots or Homer in space <g>) ... I'll give this
   one a  (D)

Joe Green:  I'm sorry, but I haven't seen an OFF episode this lame in quite
   some time.  The slow pace didn't help at all; the ghost town setup dragged
   on for around 10 minutes.  And is "Homer Simpson in Kidney Trouble" the
   best title Swartzwelder could come up with?  (D)

Darrel Jones:  Bah!  What a horrible episode!  Homer was a total jerk, and
   even when he's nice, he changes and acts mean.  The only redeeming parts
   are the ghost town at the start, and Hans Moleman.  (C-)

Haynes Lee:  The chalkboard line made no sense, the couch scene was recycled.
   And it was all down hill from there.  (D-)

Jake Lennington:  I agree with the people who didn't like this episode.  IMO,
   it is the worst episode of this season and it's in the ten worst of all
   time.  (D-)

Ondre Lombard:  I look at episodes like this, with a blank expression, and
   think, "What the hell has happened to this show?"  [...] Garbage like this
   should really make the staff ashamed of themselves  (F)

Abhi Ray:  I think this episode was better than what most people think.  The
   whole theme of Homer's fear of the operation could have been developed
   better, instead of spending so much time in the ghost town.  The entire 3rd
   act was extremely predictable, because this is the 4th episode out of 7
   this season that had Homer facing some emotional crisis.  And the ending
   was kinda lame.  Still, there were some good moments, so I'll give the
   episode a 7/10  (C+)

Mark Aaron Richey:  After an mildly amusing but overlong first act (Bloodbath
   Gulch seemed like an R-rated version of Storytown Village), Grampa's
   kidneys pop, thanks to Homer's stupidity.  The rest of the episode (slowly)
   covered Homer's plan to make up, and then (slowly) covered his fleeing and
   returning.  There was not much point, and not much humor.  Serious medical
   conditions have produced good episodes before (after all, "Homer's Triple
   Bypass" is fantastic), but this one is just dumb and pointless.  Hopefully,
   Swartzwelder's next episode will be a major improvement.  (C-)

Tom Rinschler:  IMHO, one of the best episodes in recent memory, being a good
   mixture of humor and seriousness.  The scenes at the ghost town were
   extremely funny, and had me ROFL more than once (history being filthy,
   flying animatronic robot pieces, taking pictures of boards, etc.).  The
   rest of the plot, although not as well done as this, kept up a good pace.
   The only really glaring bit was that Homer reverted at times to some of his
   less savory characteristics (which he will no doubt be pilloried for in
   this group). Still, overall an above-average effort.  (A)

Jason Rosenbaum:  Tonight's episode absolutely sucked.  It had no set mood (it
   was serious, it was humorous, serious, then crazy).  If you think about,
   great episode have had a set mood (Last Exit To Springfield had a serious
   mood, Homie The Clown was a slapstick, etc.) and this one had the premise
   of a serious episode and turned into a poor attempt of humorous episode.
   Speaking of humor, there was none.  All the attempts failed.  The
   prostitute thing got old quickly, and after that, it could have been a
   great serious episode.  When Homer jumped out the window, so did the
   episode.  Plus, the ending was one of the worst in Simpsons History.  I saw
   it coming from a mile away.  It's worse than any Ken Keeler episode.  (D-)

Eric Smith:  I have heard very negative reviews about this episode, but it
   was, in my eyes, the best episode to date.  The opening scene, (I hope you
   didn't miss it) foreshadowed an episode full of more laughs than ever
   before.  The first hospital scene was probably one of the funniest I have
   ever seen.  Highlighted by such lines as, "I'm surprised you're alive right
   now ..." and, "I'm afraid your eating days are over ...", "Kidney Trouble
   is hysterical.  (A+)

Gary Wilson:  Fair episode. I thought the first act had its moments, but was
   overall not funny and at times a little too vulgar.  But when Homer joined
   the ship of lost souls I think it really picked up.  I'm not sure exactly
   what this was a parody of (I'm sure something) but it reminded me of quite
   a number of things.  I liked Captain McAllister's  couple of lines (I
   always like his appearances) and the Peter Lorre character and the French
   guy were funny as were many of the others on the ship.  I think that was
   the best part.  There were a few too many ins and outs of Homers changes of
   heart for my liking, but I also sort of enjoyed the many changes in plot
   and setting.  I found it slightly humorous throughout, and enjoyed watching
   it without a doubt.  (C+)

Yours Truly:  Well, they can't all be gems.  The premise is potentially
   interesting, but Homer is portrayed as being too cold-hearted to be really
   funny.  As for the rest of the story, most of the humor was rather silly
   and surreal, but I did like the scenes at the ghost town and waterfront.
   Overall, it didn't quite click with me.  (C-)

>> Mike Smith in:  Title Follies

Mike Smith notes:  "Homer Simpson In: Kidney Trouble" is only the second
   episode to have an official episode title in the series.  The first is
   "Raging Abe Simpson And His Grumbling Grandson In 'The Curse Of The Flying
   Hellfish'" [3F19].  Of course, very shortly, we'll have "Marge Simpson In:
   Screaming Yellow Honkers" [AABF10].


>> Writer Watch

Mike Smith:  John Swartzwelder is truly defined by many fans of OFF as the
   Veteran writer of the series, having written more episodes than any other
   writers.  His first, "Bart The General" [7G05], was one of four episodes he
   wrote in the first season.  He has his classics (His Itchy & Scratchy
   episodes, starting with "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge" [7F09]), and his worsts
   (Like "Bart Gets an Elephant" [1F15]), but, no matter how people like or
   dislike his work, he still there!


>> Meta-reference Corner

Don Del Grande:  Bart calls himself "America's bad boy."


>> Musical References

Mark Aaron Richey:  "You are So Beautiful to Me"-mid-70's Joe Crocker song.
   About his love, it's a tad over the top (by the end of the song, he's
   practically crying). He still sings it better than Krusty, though.


>> ¿Donde esta Springfield?

David Sewell gives us one of the more comprehensive answers to the "Where is
   Springfield" mystery:  "Kidney Trouble" has clearly solved the problem of
   Springfield's location.

   Bloodbath Gulch is modeled on Old Tucson, the studio/amusement park outside
   of Tucson.  (It has elements of Tombstone, of course, but can't be
   physically located there because it is surrounded by saguaros; Tombstone is
   50 miles or so past the eastern limit of the saguaro in Arizona.)

   While driving to the ghost town, Homer looks at his watch and complains
   that they've been driving for two hours.  Shortly afterwards, they arrive
   at Bloodbath Gulch.

   We know that Springfield is on a seacoast.  The only city with a port large
   enough to harbor oceangoing vessels within anything close to a two hours'
   drive from Tucson (actually, more like four) is Puerto Peñasco (a.k.a.
   "Rocky Point") on the Gulf of California.

   Puerto Peñasco is in the Mexican state of Sonora.  Q.E.D.

   Glad to have cleared up this long-standing dilemma.


Well maybe not so fast.  Mark Skrbich rebuts:  Chicago and Duluth and other
   Great Lakes cities can handle ocean going ships and aren't on the seacoast.
   The Mississippi has been dredged so that ocean ships can travel as far
   north as Baton Rouge, LA


>> Kidneys a-popping

Several people noticed that Abe's kidneys couldn't really suffer a "double
   blowout."  Mark Aaron Richey explains why:  I don't know much about
   medicine (and unlike Homer, I freely admit it), but what happened to Abe
   is, quite simply, impossible. Kidneys produce urine, but they don't store
   it.  The bladder is the storage place for urine, and if anything was going
   to burst, it would be that. However, long before that would happen, Abe's
   body would have expelled the urine, whether or not he wanted to do it.  In
   other words, he would have peed in his pants. Even if something did happen
   to Abe's kidneys, he wouldn't have been in that bad of shape.  Until the
   transplant, he would have had to be on dialysis, and would have been fine,
   more or less.  [Dialysis patients might not be so sanguine about this, but
   at least they would be alive -- Ed.]


Haynes Lee adds:  Grampa's kidney's bursting reminds me of a Tycho Brahe (who
   had a silver prosthetic tongue [Just kidding; it was really a prosthetic
   nose -- Ed.] like Jebediah).  Supposedly in 1601 the Danish astronomer died
   from a burst bladder.  As the story goes, Tycho was at the table of a king,
   downing quite a bit of wine/other spirits. Unfortunately, etiquette
   dictated that one not rise from the table until the king did so first.
   Sure enough, Tycho's bladder burst and he died some unspecified amount of
   time later.

   [Mr. Lee provides a website, which worked as of the revision date of this
   capsule -- http://www.urbanlegends.com/death/brahe_death_of.html -- Ed.]


>> Bloodbath Gulch

Haynes Lee:  The beginning sequence for AABF04 is a lot like the 1973 Michael
   Chrichton's sci-fi western movie Westworld which takes place at an adult
   vacation resort serviced by robots. The main character Richard Benjamin
   chooses an old time Western town where something goes wrong and he is
   pursued by a  malfunctioning robot played by Yul Brenner.  A possible
   inspiration for "The Terminator" starring Arnie.


>> Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of root beer!

A few people noticed Disney bowdlerized its "Pirates of the Caribbean" ride,
   which Bloodbath Gulch referenced.  Mark Aaron Richey discusses this, too:
   the robot cowboy chasing the robot prostitute upstairs reminded me of a now
   removed scene from the Disney World ride, where pirates chased buxom women
   (they still chase the women, but now the women are carrying food).


>> Version also suitable for hospital patients

Joe Klemm:  Some films and TV episodes have "Airline Versions".  These
   versions cut out anything that involves airplanes getting into danger,
   which may give fear to those riding a plane.  A noticeable  "Airplane
   Version" of a Simpsons episode is "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington", where the
   joke where Bart releases the plane's oxygen masks was cut.


>> The man who was even luckier than Homer

Brad Bizzolt provides some clarification for those not familiar with baseball
   lore:  On July 4, 1939, during a speech to a sold-out Yankee Stadium, Lou
   Gehrig announced his retirement from baseball, due to complications from an
   unknown illness which would later come to be known as ALS (a.k.a. Lou
   Gehrig's Disease, surprisingly enough). In that famous speech, he
   proclaimed himself to be "The luckiest man on the face of the earth."  This
   is where the Lou Gehrig reference comes from, during Homer's conversation
   while at Moe's.

   [Mark Aaron Richey points out that Gehrig held the record for most
   consecutive games played until Cal Ripkin, Jr. (Baltimore Orioles)
   surpassed it in 1995 -- Ed.]


Joe Klemm adds:  Lou Gehrig was a player for the New York Yankees who was
   known for both longing a streak of consecutive games played and a rare
   disease that took his life.  The "Luckiest Man" bit spoofs his speech at
   his final game.


>> You've got to hide me, Rick!

Dale G. Abersold:  The "lost soul" with a tuxedo and Eastern European accent
   is obviously a parody of various characters played by the talented
   Hungarian actor Peter Lorre.  He is best known for his performances as
   Ugarte in "Casablanca," Joel Cairo in "The Maltese Falcon," and best of
   all, the murderer in "M."


>> Where's Maggie?

Anthony Dean asks, and answers, this question:  Anyone with any guesses as to
   where Maggie was during the family's trips to the hospital?  My guess would
   be with Marge's sisters (to Maggie's horror, no doubt, if her reaction in
   "Homer Alone" means anything ...), though another possibility could be with
   either the Flanderses or Ruth Powers (or, in the tradition of the likes of
   "Rugrats", off on some bizarre hospital-based adventure on her own ...).


Jessi Cuellar:  My guess is with Ruth.  In the episode where Marge wigs out,
   she chose to leave Maggie with Homer(of all people) instead of her sisters,
   and again in "A Streetcar Named Marge", she chose daycare over her sisters
   for little Maggie.  As for the Flanders flock, they once tried to baptize
   Maggie as their own, so I don't believe Marge would trust them with her. It
   would have been nice to see what Maggie was up to during that time.  She
   has basically become an accessory for Marge, like her beads.  I would like
   to see more of the little cutie.


>> The man with three kidneys

Mark Aaron Richey:  Star of "I Dream of Jeanne" and "Dallas", [Larry Hagman]
   had a liver transplant a few years ago, after being on the list for only a
   month (most people are on for several years).  Doctors said it was because
   he wasn't added to the list until he was dangerously ill, and needed a new
   liver immediately.  However, there were complaints that he got it simply
   because of his celebrity status.


>> Boldly going where other shows have gone before

Haynes Lee points out a connection between tonight's episode and some other
   shows:


 - "Duckman"

Mr. Lee cites "Duckman" web site for information on a related episode:  This
   Simpsons episodes is a bit similar to Duckman episode #60 ["Kidney,
   Popsicle, and Nuts"] Duckman needs a new kidney.  To get one requires a
   donation from a blood relative.  He searches for his father, who he thought
   was cryogenically frozen.  Instead he discovers that the man he thought was
   his father, wasn't.  Using the power of the Microsoft Network (Blatant
   Plug!), the twins and Cornfed find where dad is currently living.  Duckman
   and Cornfed travel there, only to find that his is a paranoid schizophrenic
   who's formed his own country.

   [From http://www.geocities.com/~j_reiko/heg/duckman/duckman.htm#ep060]


 - "King of the Hill"

Haynes Lee continues:  As with the medically graphic explanation of Grampa's
   kidney failure, "King of the Hill" had an entire episode devoted to Hank's
   constipation and he spent half of it sitting on a toilet.  That episode is
   considered a groundbreaking classic.


>> Miscellaneous, Etc.

The Haynes Lee alterna-title for this show is:  Homer Simpson And The Sundance
   Kidney


Dale G. Abersold:  If making polenta is a "procedure," then is homemade pasta
   a full-fledged "operation"?


Anthony Dean:  Is this the only episode this season so far that *hasn't* had
   some sort of celebrity guest voice?  That seems to be a rarity these days
   for the show ...


Jordan Eisenberg answers:  "Lisa Gets an "A" (AABF03)" had none, and "Bart,
   the Mother (5F22)" only had Phil Hartman, who may or may not count.


Michael Morbius:  Considering how realistically soft and elastic the
   animatron's buttocks that Grandpa fondled were, Moe could just order a pair
   of animatronic buttocks for himself, to tide himself over until Homer dies.


Mark Aaron Richey provides this quartet of items:  Inside the Actor's Studio -
   Bravo series where famous actors, graduates of the famed Actors Studio in
   New York (birthplace of the method school of acting) talk about their
   craft.

   F. Murray Abraham -- 1984's Best Actor winner (for "Amadeus"), his career
   has gone downhill since then.  He is currently playing the bad guy in the
   new "Star Trek" film.

   NyQuil - the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, etc, etc, medicine.
   Puts people to sleep so quickly because it's 10% alcohol.


Benjamin Robinson:  I liked this week's blackboard gag:  "I am not a licensed
   hairstylist."  It's especially funny if you think about what he had to do
   to merit that particular sentence ....

%
% In a zombie-movie style climax, Grampa slowly approaches the car and

%
% The day does not pass as quickly as Homer would like.

Homer:	[looking at watch] Two hours?  Why'd they build this ghost

Lisa:	Because they discovered gold right over there!
Homer:	It's because they're stupid, that's why.  That's why

Marge:	Oh, thank heaven!
Guide:	Lots of prostitutes in there!

	mean old mountains!  I hate them so much!

	people groan]
	The sea won't stand for this!

% Homer walks into a shop titled "Davey Jones' Hamper," and walks out 
% wearing a sailor hat and some better clothes.  He walks up to guy 
% painting the side of a ship

Homer:	Um, can I be a mate on your ship?  Preferably first mate.
Guy:	Well, if you'll look closely, you'll notice this is a 
	taffy shop, shaped like a ship.  [camera pulls out to show 
	that he's telling the truth]
Homer:	Oooh, I like taffy but I don't deserve taffy!

% Back at the hospital, Abe is sleeping in his bed.  Krusty comes into 
% the room, frantically strumming a ukulele.

Krusty:	Hey, hey!  [Abe wakes up startled]  Krusty, here to cheer 
	you up as part of the hospital's last laugh program!
Abe:	Last laugh?
Krusty:	So, how about that hospital food, huh?
Abe:	I wouldn't know, I'm not allowed to eat.
Krusty:	Oooo Kaaay ... let's have a look at the old chart.  
	[looks]  Oh, boy ... looks like we're both short on time!  
	Well, so I'll go to the big finish.
	[singing]  You are so beautiful toooooo meeeeeeeeeee!!!  
	[Krusty runs out of the room, and puts his head through 
	the door]  Feel better!
Abe:	Come back, doctor!

% Homer is walking along pier, and sees ship sailing away.

Homer:	A tramp steamer!  That's perfect!  [runs and jumps, and 
	hangs onto the back of the ship.  Capt. McAllister walks 
	up] I'd like to apply for a job.  [still hanging]  Any 
	job!  If you don't have a captain I could be that.
Capt.:	Arrr, what other ships have you been on?
Homer:	I've been in that one, [points] the Taffy Shop.
Capt.:	Good enough.  [helps Homer up]  Welcome aboard the ship of 
	... [grimly] lost souls ...
Homer:	The name on the back says "Honeybunch."
Capt.:	Yarr, I've been meaning to paint over that.  Now come and 
	meet the rest of the damned.  Did I mention they're ... 
	[grimly] lost souls ...?
Homer:	Well, actually you did.
Capt.:	Yarr, yarr ...
-- Homer joins the crew of ... lost souls, "Homer Simpson in:  Kidney
   Trouble"

% Homer walks into a room on the ship.  It is full of stereotypes, er, 
% lost souls.

Frenchman:	Another lost soul has joined our world-weary 
		"ensemble."
Homer:		Hey, who are you guys?
Tux Guy:	[laughs] Who are we?  No one.  Where are we sailing?  
		Nowhere.  Do we even exist?  Who knows?!
Homer:		Hey, let me off this thing!
Englishman:	Oh, don't listen to him.  We exist, all right.
Homer:		Phew ...
Woman:		We wander the seven seas trying to forget.
Homer:		Forget what?
Englishman:	Oh, boy, here we go.
Woman:		My story of jilted love is long and bittersweet.  If 
		anyone has to go to the bathroom, go now.  I don't 
		you walking around during my story.
Englishman:	My story's better, it has tigers!
Woman:		I was born into wretched poverty.  So one day I 
		stole a loaf of bread ... put it into the freezer 
		until it was very hard, then robbed a bank with it!
Homer:		[gasps]
-- Terrifying tales of the damned, "Homer Simpson in:  Kidney Trouble"

% Later, the tuxedo-wearing man concludes his tale.

Tux Guy:	... and when Mr. Dinkley saw what I had done, I was 
		banned from the car wash forever!
Woman:		Forever?  How awful.
Frenchman:	I would have killed Dinkley for that.
Englishman:	As you can see, we're contemptible lot of killers, 
		bounders, and tiger stabbers.
Frenchman:	Come, stranger, join our circle of infamy.  Tell us 
		your story of ennui.
Homer:		Well, back on land my name was ... Homer Simpson ... 
		and I guess it is here, too.  I promised my dad one 
		of my kidneys, but I chickened out on the last 
		minute and left him on his death bed.  [everyone 
		immediately stops what they were doing, shocked]
Card Guy:	Good lord!
Woman:		Oh, how could you?
Englishman:	I think I'm going to be sick.
Frenchman:	I stole this accordion from a blind monkey, but you 
		... ugh!  You disgust even me!
-- Homer Simpson, =really= lost soul

% Even a crew of lost souls has its standards.  They throw Homer 
% overboard, into the water below, and the ship sails away.

That's the last time I trust the strangest people on earth.
-- Homer Simpson, "Homer Simpson in:  Kidney Trouble"

% The sea washes Homer onto the shore.  "Even the sea won't forgive 
% me," he laments.  On the beach, a happy father and son finish 
% building a sandcastle together.  The sight inspires Homer to go 
% through with the operation and save his dad's life.  As he marches 
% off to the hospital, Homer accidentally kicks over the sand castle.  
% The kid cries, as the father yells at Homer.
%
% Turning a new leaf turns out to be more difficult than Homer 
% imagined.  The first time he walks up to the doors, fear overcomes 
% him, and he runs away.  Homer screws up his courage and tries again, 
% only to run away a second time.  The third time is the charm, as 
% Homer runs screaming into the hospital.
%
% Inside the hospital, Abe lies in the bed.  The Simpsons [minus 
% Homer] are around his bed, along with Dr Hibbert and Rev. Lovejoy.

Marge:	 Aren't you going to give him the last rites?
Rev.:	 That's Catholic, Marge.  You might as well ask me to do a 
	 voodoo dance!
Lisa:	 Dr. Hibbert, I thought you'd located another kidney for 
	 Grampa!
Hibbert: Larry Hagman took it.  He's got five of them now!  And 
	 three hearts!  We didn't want to give them to him but he 
	 overpowered us.
Abe:	 Don't worry about old Grampa.  I'm going to a better 
	 place.  Shelbyville Hospital!  [tries to get up, but 
	 can't]  Ooooh ..., who am I kiddin'?  I'm a goner.
Homer:	 [at door] No you're not, dad!
Marge:	 [gasps] Homer!
Lisa:	 Dad!
Abe:	 Son!
-- "Homer Simpson in:  Kidney Trouble"

% Homer and Abe are on the hospital beds again ...

Homer:	 I'm sorry, dad.  The way I behaved was shameful.  I guess 
	 fear made me run away.  But love made me come back.
Abe:	 Bless you, son!  I knew you'd come through for me ...
Hibbert: Now, Homer, this may sting just a tiny bit.  But ... 
	 [Homer is gone, again.  Curtains flap]
Abe:	 Oh, son of a ...
-- You got that right, "Homer Simpson in:  Kidney Trouble"

% Homer is running, scared.  He runs onto a road where Hans Moleman is 
% driving a car transporter.

Hans:	Oh dear ... [brakes, only just manages to stop before 
	hitting Homer]
Homer:	[Homer flinches in the usual getting-run-over way]
	Phew!  Boy, that ...
	[rather than being ran over, a car falls from the top of 
	the car transporter, onto Homer]
	Ow!!!

% The next thing we know, Homer regains consciousness.  The view is 
% Homer's vision.  Eyes blinking, everything is blurry.  Vision clears 
% up.  Marge, Lisa and Bart are looking at him, smiling.

Lisa:	 He's waking up!
Marge:	 Oh, Homie, I'm so glad you're all right!
Bart:	 [family moves away] Try not to move, dad.  You swallowed a 
	 lot of motor oil.
Homer:	 I'm sorry I ran off again.  Oh, I guess dad must be dead 
	 by now.  But when I get better; and after I build those 
	 shelves for the kitchen, we'll visit his grave.
Abe:	 [at door, wearing maroon suit] Grave, nothin'!  I never 
	 felt more alive!
	 [laughs and tries to jump, but something snaps]  Oooh boy, 
	 I shouldn't have done that!
Homer:	 It's a miracle!  You recovered!
	 [Marge, Lisa, Bart and Dr Hibbert smile and quietly laugh 
	 nervously]
Homer:	 What?  [silence] [whiney] What?  [looks at his side and 
	 sees stitches, indicating the removal of his kidney]  Hey!
Hibbert: While we were setting your broken bones and putting your 
	 blood back in; we helped ourselves to a kidney, and gave 
	 it to your father.
Homer:	 [annoyed, trying to get Grampa] You butcher!  Give it 
	 back!  Give me that ...!
Abe:	 [Abe makes fun of Homer, dancing etc., and then leaves]
Homer:	 [threatening] You dance out that door and ... I'll get my 
	 kidney back, old man!  You have to sleep sometime!
Lisa:	 I know you're a little peeved at Grampa, dad, but you've 
	 done a wonderful thing!
Marge:	 Yes!  You've shortened your life significantly so someone 
	 else can have a slight extension of theirs!
Homer:	 Yeeaaah, I guess you're right.  Give me a hug!  [everyone 
	 hugs Homer]
	 I don't need two kidneys.  I have everything I need right 
	 here.
	 [Homer feels Bart's kidney]
Bart:	 [laughing] Dad!  You're tickling me!
Homer:	 [falsely agreeing] Yeeaaah ... tickling ...
Bart:	 [realizes what Homer is up to.  Looks at camera, worried] 
	 Mmmm ...?
