===============================================================================
    ... the icons of TV are Krusty, Chesperito, Dr. Who, and Steven Q.
        Urkel?

        speaks?

        participate in the underground conference?
    ... the air show features "Rock You Like a Hurricane", as Bob
        predicted?

Aaron Varhola:
    ... the date "November 25" appears in the episode -- making it the
        Saturday before the episode aired?

Don Del Grande:
    ... in the couch opening, "Maggie" has a mermaid tail rather than
        legs like the others?

        rather than a sailboat?

    ... Bob doesn't step on his rake when he's doing his work at the Air
        Force Base?
    ... the guard at the air show is wearing medals rather than just the
        ribbons?
    ... only one guard is watching over the nuclear weapons?
    ... Bob's voice does indeed rise in pitch when he first mentions the
        bomb, but then returns to normal?
    ... there's a rather dated air raid shelter underground, but above
        the modernized shelter, that includes Civil Defense "emergency
        rations"?
    ... the "representatives of television" are Kent Brockman, Krusty,
        Chesperito, Tom Baker (from "Doctor Who", in costume), and
        someone who resembles an adult Steve Urkel?
    ... Maggie is smiling when the others say "Here we go again!" at the
        end?

        bomber pilot destroyed mosques during Desert Storm?
    ... when Sideshow Bob laughed his Evil Laugh (tm), the lighting did
        not, repeat not, change?  (Usually, Bob's countenance is lit
        from below when he laughs like that.)
    ... after he drops the scorpion, Krusty quickly hops out of the way
        to avoid being stung?
    ... the spider webs on all the EBS equipment?

        start or end of the season?

Yuval Kfir:
    ... Bart's backpack actually explodes when Homer's car drives over
        it?
    ... Sideshow Bob uses his very large shoes, already mentioned in the

Sideshow Mel is much too clean emerging from the refried beans and
Bernaise sauce.  {dh}

In 2F02, the prisoners at Springwood wear blue; now they wear orange.
{ddg}

Westminster Abbey doesn't have clocks on the sides of its tower; it has
sundials.  (Big Ben is right across the street, so it doesn't need
clocks.)  And why would Sideshow Bob bother with setting the clocks on
his model if they don't move?  {ddg}

Women cannot serve in combat in the US military; perhaps "Lisa" served
in another country's army.  {th}

The "severe tire damage" sign is on wrong side of the fence (the tire
damage occured when Homer backed out, not when he went in).  {dy}

The Colonel is wearing a star on each shoulder, which is the insignia of
a Brigadier General; a Colonel would have an eagle instead of a star.
{ddg}

Home appears to drink six glasses of alcohol-free Duff, but seems to get
charged for eight.  {jm}

The cash register had an old-fashioned mechanical sound but a digital
display.  {th}

The doors to the hangar disappear when Sideshow Bob pushes the buzzer.
{dh}

The "DANGER" signs on the hangar change from red to white with red
lettering to white with black lettering; then they become red again, but
much smaller than before.  {dh}

It's impossible for Bob to hook up to the Tyranno-vision feed by
clipping his cable onto the _outside_ of an insulated cable.  {dh}

The hole in Marge's hair disappears once the Harrier jets appear.  {dh}

Where is the uranium/plutonium when the bomb breaks apart?  {ddg}

Why would the computer terminal be _inside_ the air bag of the blimp
rather than the gondola?  {jm}

The electronic sign on the blimp is much larger when Homer is buying his
beer than when Lisa is displaying her message.  {ddg}

The siren used in the Air Force Base is incorrect.  It is meant to be
used for air raids.  {rl}

When Bob tries to escape in the Harrier, it taxies forward before
falling into a trench; a real Harrier rises vertically before moving
forward - hence the name "Harrier Jump Jet".  {ddg}

In the broadcast shack, the roll of paper towel behind Krusty disappears
when he is on camera.  {dy}

Maggie is not with Homer, Marge, and Lisa when they are chasing Sideshow
Bob and Bart, but she is present when Sideshow Bob is captured.  {ddg}

> Reviews
===============================================================================
Joe Manfre: A funny episode, rich in detail and subtle satire.  After
    last week's kinda shaky "Mother Simpson", this was a relief: Great
    TV jokes (easy ending, "Here we go again"), and Bart & Lisa working
    together, and right in character, again!  I've liked all the
    Sideshow Bob eps, and this was no exception.  A.

Harry McCracken [senior assoc. editor, "PC World" - ed]: This episode
    was a very good one, raised to a certain level of immortality (for
    me, at least) by its gag that mentioned "PC World" magazine.  While
    I'm sure that the series has included countless gags that were
    funnier than this one, somehow I've never laughed quite so
    boisterously.

Dale Abersold: Sideshow Bob episodes are always fun to watch, and this
    one was no exception, but somehow it seemed poorly planned.  The
    voice direction was not as fine as it usually is (Grammer, usually
    excellent, sounded like he phoned it in).  Still, there were some
    great gags, especially Grampa's first line.  Grade: C+/B-

Dave Kathman: There were plenty of laughs, but for some reason I didn't
    seem to enjoy this one as much as I'd hoped I would.  Maybe it's
    because the pace wasn't as fast as in a normal Simpsons episode;
    almost all the action took place at the air show, within the span of
    a couple of hours.

Aaron Varhola: Some hilarious and insightful parts, but the pieces
    didn't really come together; the plot dragged through most of the
    first and second, and the end was anti-climactic.  Kelsey Grammer
    was good, given the material, and I particularly liked the sly "book
    smart" reference to Lisa in the blimp.  C+.

Don Del Grande: C-plus - usually, the first two parts of the episode are
    good but then it falls off at the end; this time, the show started
    off bad but then managed something resembling humor at the end.

Chad Pimentel: Well, I liked the parts of this episode that DIDN'T deal
    with Sideshow Bob directly.  The military guy was great, and the
    scene where Milhouse gets ejected and crashes was wonderful.  Odd as
    this seems, the Simpsons are definitely at their best when they
    stray from the actual plot.

Haynes Lee: B+.  An otherwise good show.  However it should have had
    more Dr. Stranglove and should have cut out the Top Gun crap.

Ricardo Lafaurie: "That was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that
    never made me want to retch." 2F02 being the exception, I never like
    Sideshow Bob episodes.  They're appealing, but just not funny.  This
    one had too many FOX swipes and not much plot development, and the
    conclusion was rather hasty.  My Grade: D+.

Benjamin Robinson: Another fine performance by Kelsey Grammer, good
    jokes (like the air show sequences, Krusty's EBS show, and Bart's
    declaration of independence from underwear) make this latest
    installment of the misadventures of Sideshow Bob a keeper.  Grade:
    A-.

Adam Lipkin: I was eagerly waiting for this episode--Sideshow Bob is one
    of my favorite characters -- and therefore I was kind of
    disappointed by the show.  It did grow on my after a second viewing,
    though.  I nearly fell over when Doctor Who walked in.  I'm going to
    give it a B.

Dominik Halas: Hilarious!  The Sideshow Bob episodes are always great,
    and this was no exception.  There were lots of clever one-liners,
    yet another Grampa story, and of course, a whole half-hour of
    Sideshow Bob!  Grade: A.

Tony Hill: It would be nice if this could truly be his last gleaming,
    but there will undoubtedly be an ep where he takes revenge on Lisa.
    When the OFF movie is made, please leave SSB out!  Showing the
    planes hovering was a stupid gag.  Anyway, the "flying high," and
    "air-to-nerd missile" lines as well as Lisa's message get Kudos.
    B+.

Doug Yovanovich: A good episode overall, but I expected more out of a
    Sideshow Bob episode.  Some strong scripting and a few good gags
    saved this episode from mediocrity.  Score: [***--] (3 out of 5)

Yours truly: I really wasn't too fond of this episode.  Kelsey Grammar
    was outstanding as always, Lee Ermey was a fine casting choice, and
    there were funny moments, but overall, the plot felt contrived.  I
    hope Bob comes back later in a better episode.  Grade: C-.

> Comments and other observations
===============================================================================
>> "Double Dare"

Joe Manfre writes, "A children's game show that ran on the Nickelodeon
    cable network, it featured two pairs of contestants who attempted to
    answer trivia questions.  The winning pair took part in an obstacle
    course similar to Krusty's `Slobstacle' course, featuring bizarre
    mutations of playground equipment, often covered in multicolored
    slime.  The contestents would win prizes for each obstacle
    overcome."

>> Rupert Murdoch

Aaron Varhola explains, "The `Australian' prisoner Sideshow Bob gets
    into an argument with is supposed to be him.  The big controversy
    recently was Murdoch's offering Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich a
    $1.6 million advance on his book `To Renew America'.  At the time,
    Murdoch was being investigated by the FCC for alleged falsification
    of holdings of the News Corporation (an Australian corporation) when
    Murdoch bought several stations from Metromedia in 1985 (these
    stations were the beginnings of the Fox network).  Murdoch became an
    American citizen in 1985, ostensibly to purchase the stations; FCC
    regulations require at least 75% United States ownership.
    
    When Twentieth Century Holdings bought the Metromedia stations,
    Murdoch and Barry Diller owned 76% of the capital stock of 20th C.
    Holdings, and the News Corporation 24%.
    
    However, the News Corporation owns 99% of the equity in 20th Century
    Holdings.  Murdoch, in turn, holds 33% of the News Corporation
    stock.
    
    The FCC ruled that since the Fox network was "an alternative to the
    three networks", there could be an exception to the foreign-
    ownership rule.
    
    (Portions of this are in the December 12, 1994 issue of Broadcasting
    & Cable magazine, page 6.)"

>> Unfortunate timing

Ricardo Lafaurie says, "The joke of Krusty mopping the floor with
    Sideshow Mel suffered from unfortunate timing, as it aired after the
    day of a horrifying death from child abuse.  Awilda Lopez killed her
    adopted daughter by throwing her against the wall.  When it all came
    out, she admitted to certain atrocities against her child, including
    using her head to mop the floor.  This had something to do with my
    dislike of the episode."

>> "Up, Up, and Away"

Tony Hill writes, "`Up, Up and Away', its title inspired by Superman but
    referring instead to balloon flying, was written by Jimmy Webb in
    1967 and was an international hit for the Fifth Dimension."

>> "The surly bonds of earth"

Benjamin Robinson says this is a line from "High Flight", a poem about
    aviation written by John Gillespie Magee, Jr.  It goes:
    
    Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth
    And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
    Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
    Of sun-split clouds -- and done a hundred things
    You have not dreamed of -- wheeled and soared and swung
    High in the sunlit silence.  Hov'ring there,
    I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung
    My eager craft throught footless halls of air.
    Up, up the long, delirious burning blue
    I've topped the windswept heights with easy grace
    Where never lark, or even eagle flew.
    And, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod
    The high untresspassed sanctity of space,
    Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.

>> Goya

Ricardo Lafaurie notes, "Goya is a food company in Latin America that
    makes Latin American foods and sells them in the United States.  In
    case you don't watch much Spanish TV, a great many of the
    commercials are for Goya."

>> "Daisy" commercial

Joe Manfre says, "The scene with Maggie before the atomic detonation was
    similar to a campaign commercial run for President Lyndon Johnson in
    the 1964 Johnson/Goldwater presidental race.  The commercial
    featured a little girl in a field counting petals as she pulled them
    from a daisy.  As the camera zoomed in on the girl, her counting
    mixed with a voice on a speaker giving a countdown to liftoff, then
    the scene showed a nuclear explosion.  Finally, there was a message
    to the tune of `Who do you trust with this power?'  The point of the
    commercial was that Goldwater was a merciless hawk who couldn't be
    trusted with his finger on the button, and that Johnson would
    consider all the little girls in the country before deciding to
    engage in a nuclear attack.  Johnson, of course, won re-election."

Tony Hill adds, "The `Daisy Girl' ad only ran once, but the fury it
    touched off resulted in much of the campaign advertising regulation
    that existed in the US for twenty years thereafter."

>> R. Lee Ermey

Ricardo Lafaurie says, "R.  Lee Ermey is the kind of actor you can
    recognize but not name (sort of like Lane Smith.)  On TV, he
    appeared in `83 Hours 'Til Dawn' and the short-lived Fox series `The
    Adventures of Brisco County Jr.' as County's father.  Here are some
    of the more popular movies Ermey, also known as Lee Ermey, appeared
    in:

    - Full Metal Jacket (Sgt. Hartman)
    - Fletch Lives (Jimmy Lee Fainsworth)
    - True Identity (Houston's Boss) [uncredited]
    - Toy Soldiers (General Kramer)
    - Sommersby (Dick Mead)
    - Hexed (Detective Ferguson)
    - Body Snatchers (1993) (General Platt)
    - Murder in the First (Judge Clawson)
    - Toy Story (the plastic sergeant)"

===============================================================================
% The scene opens on Krusty speaking into the camera.

Krusty: I'd like to thank everybody who contributed to Krusty's canned
        food drive.  Your generous donations have made this our
        slipperiest, slimiest slop-stacle course ever!  [laughs]
         [in the background, Mel "goes" through the obstacle course]
        Our contestants will drop out of my nose, and blurp into a tub
        of refried beans.  From there, they'll stumble down a sluice of
        rich, eggy bearnaise sauce.  How can we afford it?  It's rancid!
        Then, at the finish line, a scrumptious parfait of pudding,
        pickle brine and detergent where a writhing pile of kids will
        grope blindly for hot dogs.
   Mel: Krusty, please!  It burns!
-- Krusty, humanitarian, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% Cut to Simpson's Home.  Bart and Lisa are laughing at the onscreen
% antics.

 Bart: Aw, just think, Lis: that's _our_ pickle brine burning Sideshow
       Mel.
Homer: Pfft.  That Sideshow Mel think's he's so big.  Whatever happened
       to Sideshow Bob?
 Lisa: Don't you remember Dad?
        [flash to quick scenes of each]
       He framed Krusty, he tried to kill Aunt Selma, he rigged an
       election.
 Bart: And he tried to murder me.
Homer: [in present] Oh yeah.  But what I'll mainly remember is the
       laughter.
-- Joy through selective memory, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% "I wonder what he's doing now?" wonders Homer aloud.  Cut to the
% Springwood Minimum Security Prison gate.  The gate is open and
% unattended.  Sideshow Bob is building a model building inside a
% bottle.

        Bob: Ahh, Westminster Abbey.  Edward the Confessor himself could
             not have done better.  Now to set the clocks to Greenwich
             Mean Time.
              [laughing erupts from the nearby room, disrupting Sideshow
             Bob and causing the model to crumble]
              [gasps] My dear abbey!
              [Bob runs to the next room where other prisoners are
             watching Krusty on TV and laughing uproariously]
     Krusty: [on TV] This is the way we mop the floor, mop the floor --
        Bob: Oh, must you bray night and day at that infernal
             television?
Prisoner #1: Oh, look who's talking.

% away from Sideshow Bob.  He throws his backpack to Homer, which falls
% beneath the car's wheels and then explodes.

Homer: Now you Boy!
 Bart: [scared] Oh.
        [plane approaches cops standing on their cars]
       You can't escape Bob.  If the tennis rackets don't get you, the
       pool skimmers will.
  Bob: Ooh, I never planned to escape.  You see, this is a kamikaze
       mission!  You and I are going to kill Krusty the Clown!  Hah hah
       hah!
-- The final diabolical plan revealed, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% Bob manages to avoid both the tennis rackets and pool skimmers.  Cut
% to Krusty in the civil defense shed.

Krusty: Kids...Itchy and Scratchy can't be here today.  But instead,
        we've got the next best thing!  It's the Stingy and Battery
        show!  They bite.  And light.  And bite and light and...yatta,
        yatta, you know what I'm talking about.
  Bart: You can't kill Krusty: he made you what you are.  Without him,
        you wouldn't even be called Sideshow!
   Bob: Grrrr.
Krusty: [hears noise, stops singing] What the hell is that, a lawnmower?
         [looks out window, sees plane]
        Yiaaah!
  Bart: Get out of the way, Krusty!
-- Portrait of a clown's mortality, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% Krusty jumps through the window.  The plane takes awhile to get there.

Krusty: What is the freaking holdup?
   Bob: Die, Krusty, Die!
-- Slow-motion kamikaze, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% The plane hits the shed and bounces off of it, knocking Sideshow Bob
% and Bart to the ground.  A tank rolls in and then over the plane,
% crushing it.

 Soldier: Ooh, sorry.  We don't normally drive these in the Air Force.
  Wiggum: [cuffing Bob] Got ya, ha ha, you...TV-hating mutant!
Hapablap: What is your major malfunction, Sideshow Bob?
   Marge: [kisses Bart] My little sugar bug!  [kisses] I'm so glad
          you're safe!
    Bart: But -- but -- but -- Mom!  You're embarrassing me in front of
          the Army guys!
     Bob: How ironic.  My crusade against television has come to end so
          formulaic, it could have spewed from the PowerBook of the
          laziest Hollywood hack.
-- _Could_ have..., "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"

% Grampa pulls up to the shed on a chopped motorcycle.

Grampa: Hey everybody, I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza!
Family: Here we go again!
-- More PowerBook Puke, "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"
